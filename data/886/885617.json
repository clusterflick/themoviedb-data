Through interviews with scholars and current writers, reenactments, archival materials, and excerpts from their works, it explores a genre that has been counterculture since its beginning. They were outsiders within the larger sci-fi genre and they would face harsh criticism, dismissal, and even hostility, from all sides for putting their faith and imagination into their writing. In the end, Victor Rosseau, C.S. Lewis, and Madeleine L'Engle were pioneers of a sub genre that would doggedly survive and continue to influence popular culture to this day.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rousseau, Lewis, and L'Engle","title":"The Science-Fiction Makers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12023982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
