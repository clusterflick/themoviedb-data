He is a cheerful person who supports a single mother, Yoshiko, and also takes care of a junior high school younger brother. On the other hand, my divorced father, Takuji Tamayama, is a clumsy but hateful man who lives surfing. Sawa visits his father from time to time and takes care of him. Such a peaceful daily life is completely changed by the “incident” caused by my brother. Furthermore, by a reunion with my childhood friend Takeshi who is aiming to become a professional surfer, Sawa will be aware of the “real feeling” that he has hidden in his mind.","popularity":0.2828,"poster_path":"/boSroRPljgrubPpxfxw4OD9sEvJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hinata no Sawa-chan, Namininoru!
