One of his most frequent visitors is local gang leader, John Wesley Hunter, otherwise known as “Joker” to the streets. After a day of hustling and almost losing his life in a shoot-out, Joker goes to the one place where he knows he can get help. All in a typical day’s work for Leon until an unlikely woman shows up insisting on aiding him in his fight for his community. This unlikely team defies social constructs by working together to actively fight oppression and gain nation-wide recognition for a hidden reality of many. Along their way they experience the deep-seeded hatred that has plagued America, great love, and tragedy as they leave behind a legacy.","popularity":1.4359,"poster_path":"/iG2OG2KheD3JFiZjAzVI7RtBVw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brandani Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":162737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Preston Picture Company","origin_country":""},{"id":21792,"logo_path":"/kRVU791IGotgqcnNnLaNz8wKt0j.png","name":"Sunset Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Against All Odds","title":"California Love","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Fight That Never Ends","type":"Lifetime Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa B.
