In each case the protagonist is caught up in a microcosm that suggests mental and spatial claustrophobia. As a reaction to the hopeless situation, he plunges into permanent Sisyphean activity – going nowhere and producing nothing. The motifs of perpetual attempt and constant failure find their equivalent in the repetitive structure of the loop. The scenes are allegories of our frantic and ultimately futile attempts to escape the surrounding norms, constraints, structures and rituals by which we are determined.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Perfectionist, Trilogy of Failure Part III","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Rosefeldt","original_name":"Julian Rosefeldt","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/hMsWR51LkNLHfo86qNk27gC0brX.jpg","credit_id":"616c0bdbe004a60086ee5db0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
