As her ex-husband takes their daughter and her nagging mother to the countryside, she prepares for a laidback evening with her friends. Soon she comes to realize she lost her cell phone which prevents her from receiving a much awaited call from her previous night's stand. Her friends, Iulia, Andrei and Marius, arrive and try to watch a movie. The screening is frequently interrupted by an increasingly annoying and rather absurd dialogue that takes place between the thief/finder of the cell phone and Ana.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/qi0Kk6JxIzq7hUhxqhA8zrXHYfL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51274,"logo_path":null,"name":"42 Km Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":162710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbrela Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2010-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Belly of the Whale","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Enache","original_name":"Andrei Enache","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Andrei","credit_id":"616ab38953866e0048b0f0f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1903497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iulia Lazăr","original_name":"Iulia Lazăr","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/jyrYv6r1CztPv4953x90BFe4cc8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Iulia","credit_id":"616ab3969715ae002c31e205","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marius Olteanu","original_name":"Marius Olteanu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marius","credit_id":"616ab39ee004a6004257eb25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1598108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Szel","original_name":"Ana Szel","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"616ab3b053866e0026c80f8f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20700,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dana Bunescu","original_name":"Dana Bunescu","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/3YsuCeMAWMPnA5bUGaTLwxEdlo6.jpg","credit_id":"616ab40e037264002cce19ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Lungu","original_name":"Ana Lungu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616ab3da6bdec300662fe3bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1598108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Szel","original_name":"Ana Szel","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616ab3e3be2d4900447740d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1451499,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcela Ursu","original_name":"Marcela Ursu","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/eF7eXCYzqWB8okEyxMHoZveM61j.jpg","credit_id":"616ab3ec158c850042d61b37","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3272969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Szel","original_name":"Ana Szel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616ab3d09715ae0062401923","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3272972,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexandru Paul","original_name":"Alexandru Paul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616ab3f453866e00680cd3ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Lungu","original_name":"Ana Lungu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616ab3bf53866e00680cd36a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1540808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qi0Kk6JxIzq7hUhxqhA8zrXHYfL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
