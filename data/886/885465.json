Four years later, a public hearing was held to consider the removal of the sculpture from its site in Federal Plaza in New York City. In documenting the climatic General Services Administration hearing, The Trial Of Tilted Arc is a thought-provoking indictment of the state of the arts. At issue is the validity of a contract between an artist and the government, the freedom of artistic expression, and the \"public's\" involvement in designing the visual environment. The dialogue/debate between the art community and the bureaucrats has described this site-specific art work in terms ranging from \"masterpiece\" to \"mouse trap.\"","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/4m0oOd62cCdfBW5tCtTf4E9XuBx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial of Tilted Arc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shu Lea Cheang","original_name":"Shu Lea Cheang","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/wqqhwMxoZR8uxMjaHGXhSwqsOm1.jpg","credit_id":"616a4caa924ce60042493b85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4m0oOd62cCdfBW5tCtTf4E9XuBx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
