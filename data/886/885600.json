Another home, a place they'd known as long as they can remember. A one-of-a-kind place to work, build friendships and have as much fun as possible without getting caught. The heart of their town, a farming community with more cows than people and the last outpost for Rockwell's America. But this summer Ellington, the Supermarket, and the young people who cared for it the most will grow up. A modern day Capraesque tale about growing into adulthood in small town USA, 'The Supermarket' is a story of laughter, love, old rivalries, coming home for the summer, barely functional cars, small triumphs and tragic loss, late-night lawbreaking, fearing the future, food fights, standing together, and finding your place in the world.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/cXQBGGRmh3tR9Ovth1zu802ViNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lone Knight Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This summer watch small town America grow up","title":"The Supermarket","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Jenkins","original_name":"Matt Jenkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jenkins","credit_id":"616abde690dde0002ac6b923","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Ondek","original_name":"Bob Ondek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"616abdee9715ae0088fd3062","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Tanner","original_name":"Pat Tanner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pat","credit_id":"616abdf690dde000624d8dd6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Madore","original_name":"Brian Madore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Madore / Angry Meat Worker","credit_id":"616abe006f53e1009676d5bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyne Burgess","original_name":"Carolyne Burgess","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Deirdre Boyle","credit_id":"616abe08ec18790089b4b7da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Reed","original_name":"Ed Reed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Timmy","credit_id":"616abe2a6728a8008cae9411","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Zethner","original_name":"Joe Zethner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Joe Boyle","credit_id":"616abe35e004a6005f056f71","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Paradis","original_name":"Randy Paradis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bill - Grocery Manager","credit_id":"616abe3f037264002cce2451","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Banta","original_name":"Monica Banta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Monica - Meat Manager","credit_id":"616abe471089ba0044be8966","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Norman","original_name":"Timothy Norman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616abeb3be2d490044774b6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Norman","original_name":"Timothy Norman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616abea66728a8008cae946e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337549","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cXQBGGRmh3tR9Ovth1zu802ViNn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Supermarket\" Main Trailer","key":"vMKChr83HIo","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-01T20:05:19.000Z","id":"677a1c4725e0e91c5774dfb7"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Supermarket\" Teaser Trailer","key":"6luunDy6ilE","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-01T19:41:32.000Z","id":"677a1c2082cce15a7674e6a1"}]}}}
