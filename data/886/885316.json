In its sum, this film creates the physical manifestation of the imagined characters director Taichi Kimura has written in his previous film ‘Lost Youth’ and in his feature currently in development, ‘Neon’.","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":"/yd7YrThI0DfYZctaIvu6nzLgqHe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162664,"logo_path":null,"name":"CEKAI","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Dogg","original_name":"Jin Dogg","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/xKc5okyYcdZ5x6mOiAYgXtRkGMX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6169b0c3d43f01002a327619","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3013258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manami Usamaru","original_name":"兎丸愛美","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/aydmmVWgchOJOoIzKnty0wo3UsL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6169b2d59715ae002c2fe0e7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273077,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Yardley","original_name":"Thomas Yardley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616acfd1be2d4900447765b2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2027265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taichi Kimura","original_name":"木村太一","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/3sNoIJpZmFTjhRPTewTnGgr0eYC.jpg","credit_id":"6169af0e79b3d40064bf8c79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3273069,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Seiya Uehara","original_name":"上原晴也","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6606bdb98a0e9b01624c77f6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12267960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mRjXv5I8LIfgkFRk1AYTnDW7wkL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yd7YrThI0DfYZctaIvu6nzLgqHe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
