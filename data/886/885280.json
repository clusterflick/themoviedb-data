The temperature is only positive there for two months a year. This is where the directors have chosen to put their camera down to explore the influence of an extreme environment on the mental universe and to try to understand how this environment is reflected in the imagination. The film, at the same time poetic and anthropological, listens to the accounts of the inhabitants' dreams, which it confronts with the daily gestures and life of the village, a life naked to the immensity of a natural world beyond the human environment everywhere.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/pPTQVuMouOVlkGJH1opq4mQADNH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gsara A.s.b.l.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2007-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'ai rêvé/Sinnaktulauqpunga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renaud de Putter","original_name":"Renaud de Putter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61698b7981c7be009281c8a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Bordin","original_name":"Guy Bordin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61698b5a924ce6008d08ce8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1017936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5FrcztPmeGgkwA46u0IdYLfjyF2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pPTQVuMouOVlkGJH1opq4mQADNH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"iu","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
