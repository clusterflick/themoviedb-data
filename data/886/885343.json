It was shot entirely on a (then-new) Fisher Price PixelVision PXL2000 low-fidelity camcorder in monochrome on compact audio cassette, inspiring Richard Linklater to utilize the same technique in his 1991 feature SLACKER. The film recontextualizes the image of Roger Ebert's face to provide some humorous jabs at the nature of film criticism.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/8nTQ2A2hmuUYYxF79EKsv19rir2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Confessional Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Siskel","original_name":"Gene Siskel","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/igljCvEiQdwWPC1iNIU2aq6LJVK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roger Ebert","credit_id":"6169ca235cea1800424ce458","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Siskel","original_name":"Gene Siskel","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/igljCvEiQdwWPC1iNIU2aq6LJVK.jpg","credit_id":"6169ca3981c7be0065ea2d32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Siskel","original_name":"Gene Siskel","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/igljCvEiQdwWPC1iNIU2aq6LJVK.jpg","credit_id":"6169ca43a80236002b2a2027","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.265,"height":2226,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hqF6YdE4NwQi4KM95xw2ItyqBSF.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2816},{"aspect_ratio":1.265,"height":2246,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cplxxC8TRA1FJtKUdBEkCzz3Qss.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2842},{"aspect_ratio":1.419,"height":2642,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ozoqWDlw1kZbnYY9ai9POgCbh3V.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3748}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8nTQ2A2hmuUYYxF79EKsv19rir2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
