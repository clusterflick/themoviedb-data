A teleshopping show that uses the fear of climate apocalypse as a reason to convince the audience to consume more and more. A film about consumerism and climate crisis, about global warming and individualism, about hedonism and guilty conscience, about the contradictions inside of us. A reflexion about the way we look away and an exposure of the cynicism of a capitalistic system. “A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke (“more signs of the Apocalypse!”). Which is another way of looking away.”","popularity":0.0785,"poster_path":"/3Cyr4JTiVC7ye8npVSJho2RvOlx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apocalypse Baby, We Advertise the End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1456388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Riedler","original_name":"Julia Riedler","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/glKl83ygqPGUUnvKkZpzYkvoybb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61f1c03de9da6900c42238bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Camille Tricaud","original_name":"Camille Tricaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61f1c043498bc200cb8e02d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2772828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franziska Unger","original_name":"Franziska Unger","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61f1c04c9a3c4900ec1c9b6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1841134,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wouter Wirth","original_name":"Wouter Wirth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61f1c051d7cd0600d91f9471","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Camille Tricaud","original_name":"Camille Tricaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b8b07d43f01002a364abd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2772828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franziska Unger","original_name":"Franziska Unger","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b8b10ec1879004347c78e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15421408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Cyr4JTiVC7ye8npVSJho2RvOlx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Arte (Court-circuit)","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
