Sure, everyone agrees they’re the tastiest part of the chicken, but as this movie shows, they can also be dangerous!  Beaks! goes by a few alternate names, like Birds of Prey (sans Harley Quinn) and Falco Terror (an objectively cool title), but of course we had to go with the version that provides its own thrilling punctuation. It stars a Blue Lagoon-less Christopher Atkins, and it’s an eye-plucking delight. Seriously, there’s a lot of eye-plucking. Whether you’re hang gliding, enjoying coffee on your balcony, or sitting in a small country church, the birds in Beaks! are more than ready to pluck the heck out of your eye.
