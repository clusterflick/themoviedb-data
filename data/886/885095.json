Together with the explorer girls and Pablo, Dora and friends work together and go on adventures while discovering the secrets of their city. Dora has a magical charm bracelet and a smartphone, complete with an app version of Map (voiced by Marc Weiner), to aid her. Kate is a girly girl who is fond of theater, while Emma loves music. Alana is a tomboy (just like Dora at times) but loves animals, Naiya is smart and loves to read and Pablo loves playing soccer. The characters are all bilingual and speak Spanish in addition to English. However, the Spanish curriculum of this series has been expanded to using simple phrases and commands as opposed to solely the single Spanish words used in the previous series.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vPUfGqVvZzvwon0iJkxuraiD6uR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dora and Friends: Into the City","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vPUfGqVvZzvwon0iJkxuraiD6uR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
