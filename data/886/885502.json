Thomas, Pink, Fisher, Dean, and Roman have just moved out to Los Angeles and they aspire to become \"players\". But first they have to start at the bottom, working as personal assistants to a variety of maniacal producers, agents, and studio executives.

As time moves on, our lead characters struggle to move up the corporate ladder while keeping their sanity and morals
