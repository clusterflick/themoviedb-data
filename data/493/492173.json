A step further in the so-called sub-genre practice of found footage film – recycled material – is also put forward for consideration in this project. The appropriationism applied in this work makes use of material found in Hollywood cinema (Singin’in the rain, Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1952); Pink Panther; Buster Keaton; etc., the first avant-garde period (Un chien andalou, Luis Buñuel & Salvador Dalí, 1929) and American experimental film (Wavelength, Michael Snow, 1966-1967). Such method makes possible, therefore, to maintain image ecology while it provides an analysis of the history of cinema. — AP","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/sNgdD1DKnsTPxN4WhAI90YSMQyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Quartet/Polyframe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoni Pinent","original_name":"Antoni Pinent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2ed2bbc3a3680b9d155e92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sNgdD1DKnsTPxN4WhAI90YSMQyt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
