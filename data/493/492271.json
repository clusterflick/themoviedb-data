Inspired by the Legion of Honor’s role as a location for Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958), Hershman Leeson explores the tension at the core of Vertigo between the difficulty or lack of desire to distinguish between reality and fiction versus the pursuit of truth. The eponymous ghost of Hershman Leeson’s project is the elusive nature of a singular identity that haunts the characters in the 1958 film, its most enigmatic representation being the painting of a supposed distant relative of the film’s protagonist Madeleine, around which her character and fate is imagined.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/xtFyRH5Dc9EndMxQsMwmZVx0rik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VertiGhost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"vertighost","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","original_name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/bB9lV7TTiyjKggMVTMWopROJXED.jpg","credit_id":"5a2fa765c3a3680b8d17156d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","original_name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/bB9lV7TTiyjKggMVTMWopROJXED.jpg","credit_id":"5a2fa75ac3a3680b93174dd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","original_name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/bB9lV7TTiyjKggMVTMWopROJXED.jpg","credit_id":"5a35c023c3a36814b9044f76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","original_name":"Lynn Hershman-Leeson","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/bB9lV7TTiyjKggMVTMWopROJXED.jpg","credit_id":"5a35c013c3a36814ab049c7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7655154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.633,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xtFyRH5Dc9EndMxQsMwmZVx0rik.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco","release_date":"2017-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
