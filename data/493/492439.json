Retired colonial army officer George Thacker has high hopes of recapturing his memories of an idyllic English village life after a lifetime of meting out justice in the Far East.

Worst of all, the ghost of his old flame, Edith, still haunts him, threatening both his marriage and his life.","popularity":2.57,"poster_path":"/Vjh2y9dXNY0OMrqRFN0eeY8FPe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
