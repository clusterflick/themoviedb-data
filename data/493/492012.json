In the heart of the \"Bible Belt\" in Tennessee, the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia have fully embraced that love in the living of their vows and apostolic life for 150 years. Like their patron, the virgin martyr Cecilia, the Nashville Dominicans promise their heart to Christ and it is His voice that fills their ears and secures their promise to be His alone. This joyful, holy community radiates their love for Christ and neighbor, revealing in this compelling film what it means to live the consecrated life as both a contemplative and a teacher. They manifest to the world that religious life is all about love and joy, but a love that is different and unique. It is a love that is eternal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c6yM9pp4gveOP9c9XeJNK7iCweX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beloved: The Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1277,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c6yM9pp4gveOP9c9XeJNK7iCweX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
