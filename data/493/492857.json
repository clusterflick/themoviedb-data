Mr. Browntop and Miss Kelsomine go out to play golf. They engage Andrew McTavish, a lean Scotchman, as caddy. After teeing the ball, Browntop hoists it with a tremendous drive into the sky. They search and search, but still no ball. At length, wearied with the quest, they lie down in a haystack to sleep. They wake 20 years later, aged and forlorn, but still continuing the search for the ball.","popularity":0.2147,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Caddy's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Miss Kelsomine","credit_id":"5a34412f92514103241b4c50","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Browntop","credit_id":"5a344140c3a3680b9d1a2f93","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0358406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1911-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
