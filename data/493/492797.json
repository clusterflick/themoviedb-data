Sade was born in 1755 and already in 1778 he was sentenced to a years-long prison, which was renewed by himself because of the writing of \"scandalous\" texts. This saved his life after the French revolution, but he soon came into conflict with Robespierre.","popularity":0.2141,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France
