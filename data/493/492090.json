In an ultra-controlled and militarized Japan, the press is passionate about this transgressive incident, while the murderer defends herself, presenting her crime as an act of \"crazy love\". Relayed to the West, this murder conveys the image of a fantasized Japan, where all impulses are given free rein.","popularity":0.2762,"poster_path":"/e3onZKACewwg2XurXGs04uh8jkY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abe Sada: A Japanese Crime of Passion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuelle Blanchard","original_name":"Emanuelle Blanchard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a2e53a7c3a3680b8a159803","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsuyuki Hidaka","original_name":"Katsuyuki Hidaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2e53e70e0a264cc41564e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Marran","original_name":"Christine Marran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2e53f6925141033915dab6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérald Peloux","original_name":"Gérald Peloux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2e544ec3a3680b9615d29a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphan de Mesnildot","original_name":"Stéphan de Mesnildot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2e546a9251410329164ec0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sada Abe","original_name":"Sada Abe","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2e54740e0a264cc115a2ee","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis Coat","original_name":"Louis Coat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e538b0e0a264cc4156498","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939045,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominique Kalifa","original_name":"Dominique Kalifa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e53c3c3a3680b8a159821","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Peyrard","original_name":"Sophie Peyrard","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e5370c3a3680b9615d1f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Peyrard","original_name":"Sophie Peyrard","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e53650e0a264cc4156477","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e3onZKACewwg2XurXGs04uh8jkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":732}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":199645,"name":"crime of passion"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
