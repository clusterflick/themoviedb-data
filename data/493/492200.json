Predominantly unknown despite her spectacular finds, including Icthyiousauri, a Pterodactyl and Plesiosaurus, and notwithstanding the fact that Darwins' 'Origin of Species' was largely influenced by her work. She is at last becoming the most celebrated paleontologist of all time.","popularity":0.4655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":149867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mermade","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mary Anning, fossiler of the 1800's Jurassic Coast strives for equality and recognition.","title":"Mary Anning and the Dinosaur Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1817647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Sheehan","original_name":"Sharon Sheehan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mary Anning","credit_id":"6620c8acae3843015528d0d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1019022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Howe","original_name":"Jackie Howe","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs Molly Anning","credit_id":"6620c8f48a88b20162c9b358","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Liddell","original_name":"Anna Liddell","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/zCzQAg0J4tdNdtkAwWruI9YXJXH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jane Austen","credit_id":"6620c907e4c9eb017cf57492","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Machell","original_name":"Tom Machell","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Henry De La Beche","credit_id":"6620c922e4c9eb00e6f4e4d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Fletcher","original_name":"Mark Fletcher","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mr Anning","credit_id":"6620c9318a88b20185ca1175","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Moore","original_name":"Jonathan Moore","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/2FKfxHZd5GdwPcLabDlchabVa33.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sir Richard Owen","credit_id":"6620c9528a88b20162c9b381","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1804412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Boother","original_name":"Stuart Boother","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/dCQAZ3kGiiJtwRYGX85ZJGDsdpl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Shandor Loiza Tamas","credit_id":"6620c96fd04d1a01810b39c2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4659690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Morrison","original_name":"Richard Morrison","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"King of Saxony","credit_id":"6620c99b960cde0164a63859","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4659691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Storrier","original_name":"Paul Storrier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Rev.
