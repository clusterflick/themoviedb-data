He, however, is equally pursued by Nancy Barron, whom Christine dislikes. Ned Klegg loves social secretary Barbara, and resents the attention paid her by Barron, Nancy's elderly husband. Nell Martin, a servant in the Hollins home, is in love with the gardener but is persecuted by the butler. Aviator Mulvain and his mechanic Le Prim arrive, and Le Prim absconds with Nancy in an auto, pursued by Mulvain and Christine, who force him to release her. Christine announces her engagement to Mulvain, who declares he is a poor man. In the resulting commotion, it transpires that Nell, threatened with exposure, has drowned herself. The shock brings a change of emotion: Barbara rejects Barron and accepts Klegg, and Christine accepts Mulvain, content to share his poverty. Considered a lost film.","popularity":0.3915,"poster_path":"/sqACU1Eo6icKmmhFnWE2xgTqb2b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mayflower Photoplay Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ladies Must Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29347,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Ellis","original_name":"Robert Ellis","popularity":0.2122,"profile_path":"/ecUP4Ja2FeuFZv9ADwuxs8uUHrs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anthony Mulvain","credit_id":"5a34b7b8c3a36814ae0377f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahlon Hamilton","original_name":"Mahlon Hamilton","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/jC8MQCyxxXSrNNyW7AvDGtu1GVI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ralph Lincourt","credit_id":"5a34b7cd925141547e03580d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Compson","original_name":"Betty Compson","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/wBvlOvaNmxbTYWgiE8iCqop7Psj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Christine Bleeker","credit_id":"5a34b7e2c3a36814ae037830","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Barbara","credit_id":"5a34b7f3925141032c1c1cec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardee Kirkland","original_name":"Hardee Kirkland","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/ye5vaJ6CCGmpxRUog4tieuJFUtC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"William Hollins","credit_id":"5a34b8030e0a264cca1ba4fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibson Gowland","original_name":"Gibson Gowland","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/5peWO8JpDAgeb5NPGoOWvkpiyhX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Michael Le Prim","credit_id":"5a34b817c3a368148f033ee7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilbert","original_name":"John Gilbert","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/wibrEasDmipryIht6W6ajxAAQgH.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Gardener","credit_id":"5a34b861c3a3680b9d1a955b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleo Madison","original_name":"Cleo Madison","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/z7CkuJJTARgVfvdol4voHIMiqtu.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Lincourt","credit_id":"5a34b870c3a36814ae0378af","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snitz Edwards","original_name":"Snitz Edwards","popularity":0.1314,"profile_path":"/hZzvzPNMoo9FhvBTURdsuMKY1fR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Edward Barron","credit_id":"5a34b87dc3a3680b9d1a9566","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Hutton","original_name":"Lucille Hutton","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/m6a7kXySHXTqTLZK1g3Lrj4CVx6.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Nell Martin","credit_id":"5a34b88d0e0a264cc11b952b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lule Warrenton","original_name":"Lule Warrenton","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/cKT15bHW6ysYEHryH2gqrhRWbRW.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Nora Flanagan","credit_id":"5a34b89dc3a368148f033f5e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William V.
