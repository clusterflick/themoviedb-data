This time it's glittering Zurich. The protagonists: Karl and Lisa. They fall in love. The usual. But Karl is a so-called 'loser'. Does drugs, borrows money and is in debt everywhere. Responsibility is alien to him. He lives day to day, detests relationships and he's heading straight for the abyss. Finally, when he loses Lisa, too, he has a major breakdown and finally begins to fight for both her and himself. Lisa is disappointed by Karl's way of life, even though she isn't a shining example of responsibility herself. Both are running from reality. And what was that about 'devotion', 'freedom' and 'trust'? This is a film about love. Not the conquering-all kind but real love. With all its weaknesses, its volatility, and its egoism.","popularity":0.1242,"poster_path":"/n2SqwCVxfw7QUNblSZ2VEv400Mj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59331,"logo_path":"/w7XNUWHMk1Zkb2q5siSmcOr1PCW.png","name":"Cornelsen Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simplify Your Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Reinhardt","original_name":"Филипп Рейнхардт","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/3p9EUHggTO47bJsjfLjeA7Pd0iz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karl Rothstein","credit_id":"5a2e851d9251410330157c39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerita Schumacher","original_name":"Marguerita Schumacher","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lisa Weiss","credit_id":"5a2e8545925141032c1643aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Strittmatter","original_name":"Nadine Strittmatter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jelena von Warren","credit_id":"5a2e85549251410339160908","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urs Althaus","original_name":"Urs Althaus","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/ltce3DkRgjXpewU1Ia2KWjsn5KA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ray","credit_id":"5a2e8569c3a3680b9a17450e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Meyer","original_name":"Christian Meyer","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/imzgyVD38HhxDG555BJ084H8Rpg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Band Leader","credit_id":"5a2e857d0e0a264cbc168692","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gundars Āboliņš","original_name":"Gundars Āboliņš","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":"/iSAL8rWneDOsrDmkEn2rocOiKOX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Latvian Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60e4770c8805510074e10933","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","original_name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e4747d07faa200774fa737","department":"Sound","job":"ADR Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Boestfleisch","original_name":"Markus Boestfleisch","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e474e0a3b5e6005d8ebec1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148021,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lars Burghardt","original_name":"Lars Burghardt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e4751484591c002d71c91c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1652804,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jenny Barth","original_name":"Jenny Barth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e4767eb76cbb004617110a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205231,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martin Oberhaus","original_name":"Martin Oberhaus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e476a526dac1002361d287","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3386238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Hahn","original_name":"Alexander Hahn","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65420bcc8de0ae00ac71b0f7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Boestfleisch","original_name":"Markus Boestfleisch","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e8507c3a3680b9a1744c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2664984","wikidata_id":"Q106719279","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n2SqwCVxfw7QUNblSZ2VEv400Mj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1147}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
