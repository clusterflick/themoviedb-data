As they mature, Shmuel becomes more orthodox and religious while Jacob is exposed to Christianity and ends up becoming a leader of Messianic Judaism, spreading the word of Jesus. Shmuel and the entire Orthodox community treat Jacob as a radical missionary and accuse him of stealing pure Jewish souls. The conflict between the two brothers escalates to real violence when an attempt is made to kill Jacob, causing the dissolution of the entire family.","popularity":0.1199,"poster_path":"/sT1ALpkWSYJ52v6tcMw5C8fecGP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Spirit","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2805494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imri Biton","original_name":"Imri Biton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"611d146b3876510073123688","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1466055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ohad Shahar","original_name":"Ohad Shahar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"641cab53b9a0bd007f0b23f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doron Ben-David","original_name":"Doron Ben-David","popularity":0.1538,"profile_path":"/bSrRVAKtmu6hOsvvsOTZsqlBZVx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Shmuel","credit_id":"641cab60142ef1009b42733d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3153678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moriya Ben-Harush","original_name":"Moriya Ben-Harush","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"641cab73a3e4ba00e71f05f6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doron Eran","original_name":"Doron Eran","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d145e514c4a00299f0110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976276,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dani Reichental","original_name":"Dani Reichental","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641cab86a3e4ba00e71f0604","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976277,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan Ronen","original_name":"Dan Ronen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641cab97142ef100ba36b215","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316854,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boubkar Benzabat","original_name":"Boubkar Benzabat","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641caba6b9a0bd009954b357","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860960,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eyal Sibi","original_name":"Eyal Sibi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641cabb5142ef100d9bbe862","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doron Eran","original_name":"Doron Eran","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2fe41f0e0a264cbc17c3c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7398716","wikidata_id":"Q122463524","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.734,"height":139,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xbYPWMSFniFxwjPQG4snapI3vMt.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":797}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1204,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/sT1ALpkWSYJ52v6tcMw5C8fecGP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":862}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
