They are Muslims who speak a Slavic language. Throughout the years they were always used for political games of power between the surrounding nations (Serbs, Macedonians, Bulgarians, Albanians, Bosnians...). This is the first film that deals with the way these people are, not who they are or who they belong to. The film observes their everyday life, diverse culture, rich herds of cows, sheep and shepherd dogs. They work, talk, dance, play music, discuss, preach, pray, walk and sing as the mountains above remind them how ephemeral their existence is.","popularity":0.3319,"poster_path":"/dfDepKfiL2kD0EHn1m5Cb6Jh1aU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84403,"logo_path":null,"name":"EED//Productions","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":100539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovofilm","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2017-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gora","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Gora","type":"Serbian Latin"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Malešević","original_name":"Stefan Malešević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oqwl07NvjLSk6I6u3K2IfTQi0EV.jpg","credit_id":"5a75fb020e0a266435039ae5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Malešević","original_name":"Stefan Malešević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oqwl07NvjLSk6I6u3K2IfTQi0EV.jpg","credit_id":"5a75faf90e0a26643003b7ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580612,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakov Munižaba","original_name":"Jakov Munižaba","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd927df9251415ec5cfd198","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Malešević","original_name":"Stefan Malešević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oqwl07NvjLSk6I6u3K2IfTQi0EV.jpg","credit_id":"5cd927d20e0a264e5dcd1fc1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877828,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jelena Maksimović","original_name":"Jelena Maksimović","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd927b792514111ded27b50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5927470","wikidata_id":"Q26912986","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9pPBPZlaJLcbh1alWUBcurV58fD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"sr","file_path":"/dfDepKfiL2kD0EHn1m5Cb6Jh1aU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOYJMibe4rPqT9BCFk87DsWSNzh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7239,"name":"kosovo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beldocs","release_date":"2017-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
