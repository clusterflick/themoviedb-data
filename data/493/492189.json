The guide, Louis, recounts various Savannah ghost stories and legends to his seemingly lone patron, Paige. Her bizarre and dazzling visions make up the individual music videos, tied together by Louis' storytelling. \"Hearse Song\" sees a man at work being harassed by unseasonable trick-or-treaters. He meets an untimely, sugary end. \"The Attic\" features a little girl's psychedelic decomposition. A pig farmer and his brother perform at a carnival in \"Pigman's Bridge,\" with grave results. A witchy fantasy for \"Trick\" takes a turn for the demonic. In \"Wait for the Day,\" a lengthy hospital stay gives new meaning to \"vegetative state.\" The hearse tour ends at a ghastly soiree for the video \"White Satin Gown,\" where Paige immediately senses something is amiss.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/2wFHWrcLm98q8ujg4yvQDaxrj6M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graveface Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marshmallow Ghosts present Corpse Reviver No. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Clausi","original_name":"Louis Clausi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Hearse Driver","credit_id":"5a2ef2bf925141032c16bce1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paige Matthews","original_name":"Paige Matthews","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Paige/Victim","credit_id":"5a2ef563c3a3680b8816ddcf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Brochu","original_name":"Jeff Brochu","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Pigman","credit_id":"5a2ef58d0e0a264cd016a641","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Pena","original_name":"Grace Pena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ghost","credit_id":"5a2ef5a4c3a3680b96167b54","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher T.
