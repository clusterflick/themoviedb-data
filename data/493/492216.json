It's been years since Brigitte has seen her sister Candide or their recently-deceased mother, though when she is called on to sing at the funeral her since of duty supercedes any lingering family conflicts. But it's obvious that Candide harbors a lingering grudge, and as the alienated sisters come together in grief at their mother's country home unspoken hostilities gradually simmer to the surface. Both siblings are noted singer songwriters; Candide specializing in a more delicate brand of acoustic ballads and Brigitte using her talents to exorcise a lingering inner rage. The history of their relationship is written in Candide's lyrics, providing remarkable insight into the sibling's stormy relationship. Eventually, Brigitte discovers a tape of her mother's old music, leading the two sisters to collaborate on a song that could finally help to begin the healing process.","popularity":0.1974,"poster_path":"/p4oe8v1K3bT1NVmTXAsuX9g9fYz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mona's Daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viviane Audet","original_name":"Viviane Audet","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":"/5rkLxxu0znzZ8dyNLUyxtMtCjLq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2f1e5292514103241676ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Neige Chatelain","original_name":"Marie Neige Chatelain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2f1e580e0a264cc1166a59","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanie Allard","original_name":"Joanie Allard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2f1e680e0a264cc4162a39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Michaud","original_name":"Stéphane Michaud","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2f1e730e0a264cca167d65","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles-Vincent Martel","original_name":"Gilles-Vincent Martel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2f1e800e0a264cca167d73","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafaël Ouellet","original_name":"Rafaël Ouellet","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/ddViRY7ne0bvp6cHW34ww5oYO6Z.jpg","credit_id":"5a2f1e139251410330161109","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0970928","wikidata_id":"Q3222039","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4oe8v1K3bT1NVmTXAsuX9g9fYz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
