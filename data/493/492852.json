At a time when greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are at their highest levels in history, with people experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, including shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events, Akomfrahâ€™s Purple brings a multitude of ideas into conversation. These include animal extinctions, the memory of ice, the plastic ocean and global warming. Akomfrah has combined hundreds of hours of archival footage with newly shot film and a hypnotic sound score to produce the video installation.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":"/3sEZk97vweJagr0GMdMhLgWxSKj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Purple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trevor Mathison","original_name":"Trevor Mathison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3426c4925141032c1b954b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941779,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Lawson","original_name":"David Lawson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a34272ac3a368148f02beea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Akomfrah","original_name":"John Akomfrah","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/9ok6rVjT76dmzzNzCUhpjhiMsZA.jpg","credit_id":"5a342687c3a368148f02be22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941778,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lara Garcia-Reyne","original_name":"Lara Garcia-Reyne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3426aac3a3680b8d1b500d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932960,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tandis Jenhudson","original_name":"Tandis Jenhudson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3426d80e0a264cca1b1ef2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Julyan","original_name":"David Julyan","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/3VP6FClhIXLwRqVwiqD5t23wPkF.jpg","credit_id":"5a3426ed925141032c1b957b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lina Gopaul","original_name":"Lina Gopaul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a34270a92514103241b3137","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941780,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashitey Akomfrah","original_name":"Ashitey Akomfrah","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3427450e0a264cc11b1006","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63599,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dewald Aukema","original_name":"Dewald Aukema","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c79210f3655004024f141","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7502152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sEZk97vweJagr0GMdMhLgWxSKj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
