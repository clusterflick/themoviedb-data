A German TV crew, led by journalist Gideon Bachmann, explores the epicenter of the sixties revolution in art, music, poetry and film and interviews the main players in the “New American Cinema,” that was born on the streets of New York. Against a backdrop of cultural upheaval in all of the arts and growing political agitation against the Vietnam War, Bachman interviews the most prominent figures in “underground film,” including Jonas Mekas, Shirley Clarke, the Kuchar Brothers and Bruce Connor, and visits the most notorious location in the New York art world of the era - Andy Warhol’s Factory - to conduct an interview with the genius of Pop Art himself.","popularity":0.4097,"poster_path":"/oGegPkpxB3WUHRfMATXDu9pN3Km.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underground New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Ginsberg","original_name":"Allen Ginsberg","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/w7qQvokS1lp7IRgefiJdALaaiIi.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a32c1670e0a264cd01a436a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirley Clarke","original_name":"Shirley Clarke","popularity":0.2233,"profile_path":"/8GI3B7YW6Cv87hetfp17zNX4d5A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a32c174925141547b01a315","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfas Mekas","original_name":"Adolfas Mekas","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/q5nHzCDUVHiUA7vWaB0bptF2ovR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a32c183c3a368148f019514","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a32c18bc3a3680b8d1a1ac0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelangelo Antonioni","original_name":"Michelangelo Antonioni","popularity":0.8047,"profile_path":"/aGrzCeNCEZEI1DhLS8HjWDKNude.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a32c19f0e0a264cc119daf6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633817df38469a007ac46a11","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kuchar","original_name":"Mike Kuchar","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/lw5oEJtwfHwxEV6zfeE05EMqeB7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633817e738469a007fb42839","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633817f9c2ff3d007d93889a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Conner","original_name":"Bruce Conner","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/mw0E9AMe6vmSQfAfTQx53KgfIGU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63381806501cf20081929f08","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gideon Bachmann","original_name":"Gideon Bachmann","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/b74yePNOdoYx6hFaaIC2Gv0aVMp.jpg","credit_id":"5a32c1b0925141032419f1d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGegPkpxB3WUHRfMATXDu9pN3Km.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":166514,"name":"underground film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Date Unknown","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Underground New York - Gideon Bachmann (1968) TRAILER","key":"cizxOkkr5XM","published_at":"2016-02-26T15:13:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a32c24a925141032419f273"}]}}}
