With her fierce desire for independence and habit of pushing the boundaries, Billie finds herself in situations that, despite her best attempts at being a ‘grown-up’, she is not quite ready for. But she and her best friend Milla are finally given the chance to prove they’re just as responsible as the ‘big kids’: they can walk to the shops alone, without a babysitter. Along the way, however, their dark and wild imaginings suddenly become a reality when one of their games puts Milla in danger. It is up to Billie to rescue her friend before it’s too late.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mulberry Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3253138,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Trumble","original_name":"Andrew Trumble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61556eb3dcb6a3002a91fbeb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Dephoff","original_name":"Grace Dephoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61556ec1fab3fa008db9321f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3253137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evangeline Parks","original_name":"Evangeline Parks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61556e9ee8a3e1002c0fe762","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
