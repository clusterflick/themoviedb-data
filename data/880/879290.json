We climb aboard the world's only flying B-24J, fly across the Florida Everglades in the nose of a B-17 Flying Fortress and fire up the legendary Merlin engine of the world's only dual control P-51C Mustang. Then Ted takes off for England to search for the home bases of the Mighty Eight Air Force and visits a church with a special connection to the B-17 bomber crews that were stationed nearby.
