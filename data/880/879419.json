After his acclaimed Thanatomorphose, genre filmmaker Éric Falardeau is both behind and before the camera in this sensory extravaganza, somewhere between an occult hallucination and a self-portrait of conflicted masculinity, that serves up a heady mix of horror, poetry and unbridled eroticism. A tribute to the magic of Méliès, the early American avant-garde and underground film (think: Kenneth Anger), Asmodeus renders bodies and fluids transcendent through its use of textured black-and-white Super 8 and in-camera special effects. A cinematic memento mori that’s at once carnal and otherworldly.","popularity":0.4077,"poster_path":"/aiHtCCaVlqIGtaVobiasx9inBQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asmodeus","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1097527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éric Falardeau","original_name":"Éric Falardeau","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/DK1Y3go50tInRjFkb99PTDosZI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"61afbc0f1684f70061bf97d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annaëlle Winand","original_name":"Annaëlle Winand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Asmodeus -
