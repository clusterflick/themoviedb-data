A meditative journey of revisitation and discovery, this short film essay maps the past through four handmade dioramas that chronicle different explorations of the suburban waterway: from the director’s own reimagined memory and a dreamscape of native fauna, to the Indigenous significance of the site and the closing vignette, in which the narrator – visiting the ford for the first time in 10 years – speaks of how tracing back can lead to memory’s own turning point.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8Pz8J91Rfqj3V99OtQRY7uZvLZL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Formation of a Cloud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicky Lam","original_name":"Vicky Lam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"61531b3edd731b0062ff65cc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenn Tran","original_name":"Jenn Tran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61531977dd731b0029b1f679","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenn Tran","original_name":"Jenn Tran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61531987d1ca2a0023e3131f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenn Tran","original_name":"Jenn Tran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6153198f9f5dfb0029f5661c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenn Tran","original_name":"Jenn Tran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61531b25dd731b0029b1f9c2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mara Schwerdtfeger","original_name":"Mara Schwerdtfeger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61531b68e8a3e1008ae3890a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":781,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Pz8J91Rfqj3V99OtQRY7uZvLZL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
