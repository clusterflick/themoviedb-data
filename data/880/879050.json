The driven Blaine had such a complicated relationship with their mother that she is desperate to the point of obsession. Amy, in turn, just wants to be with her sister; her quick wit and carefree attitude have made it difficult to connect with Blaine. When they hear a rustle in the bushes and a tiny gun, the two must contend with the emotional stakes and physical exhaustion.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Marshall","original_name":"Alexandra Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Blayne","credit_id":"61532c03e8a3e1008ae3a69e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teagan Nowicki","original_name":"Teagan Nowicki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Amy","credit_id":"61532c18158c850061bfff6e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Barlin","original_name":"Kelly Barlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61532e59fab3fa008db49178","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251068,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanna Waksmundzka","original_name":"Joanna Waksmundzka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61532bb1158c85004257d5e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251069,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ahmadah Adil","original_name":"Ahmadah Adil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61532bbd9f5dfb0042365be6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Barlin","original_name":"Kelly Barlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61532ba367dcc9008ce8d1c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Barlin","original_name":"Kelly Barlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61532e60f04d0100444f3930","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
