Society here can only be described as a matriarchy, where beliefs, spells, and traditional rituals are passed down the female line. Musical contributions from village residents serve as a leitmotif for the film: unsteady renditions of old songs that reveal performances belonging to a distant past. The population of these communities has aged considerably — but the place itself is timeless.","popularity":0.0623,"poster_path":"/vBtCc5IyDSMKU2tbOakInB81JMa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OK Good, Pinega","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Ladno Khorosho, Pinega","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1622802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sasha Kulak","original_name":"Саша Кулак","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/xIVVGPLLTllDU1jVso5qGAlcuna.jpg","credit_id":"6153379edd731b0042a3d76e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1987279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Kurmangalina","original_name":"Юлия Курмангалина","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615337b1158c85002c520d55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tGsnjouWJ0yP82VwGDim9xrUzOO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eC7mU7wy4V0B0yoFEGWG9oMgki5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1UlbkVPex249V1GYme5Yje8LqOW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jp2De6qE6xHtjEVG3bq3tHB5iE8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWR37SI9r0JTDFNhTfNzazcLjyR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBtCc5IyDSMKU2tbOakInB81JMa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Calvert Journal Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
