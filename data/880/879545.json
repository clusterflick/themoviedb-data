Though they themselves shun television and the seductive temptations and trappings of modernity, they agreed to go on camera for the very first time. But not everyone inside this ultra-strict, ultra-insular and virtually self-sufficient community approved: some members opposed the filming because they view exposure to the outside world as a challenge to their strictly Jewish way of life, which largely comprises of piety and prayer. Told through the eyes of three members - Raizel Fogel, Shlomo Abelesz and Rabbi Aryeh Goldman - Strictly Jewish lifts the lid on this closely guarded Jewish sect, revealing a community steeped in ancient rites and rituals, and managing to maintain an ancient faith more than 5000 years old.","popularity":0.1001,"poster_path":"/odDFpDFog8iCXR7c5RYBI3uDtDz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Secret World of Adass Israel","title":"Strictly Jewish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Strictly Jewish:  The Secret World of Adass Israel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Ben-Moshe","original_name":"Danny Ben-Moshe","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/5CBafL1iA1Y65t9WHYSCUB7BLla.jpg","credit_id":"61552bb9e8a3e1006222690d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5663012","wikidata_id":"Q27055185","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/odDFpDFog8iCXR7c5RYBI3uDtDz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"SBS Australia Premiere","release_date":"2016-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
