Reflecting some of the many facets of Latin-American culture or \"Latinidade\", the film contemplates elements of magic realism - a literary movement from the global south that emulates the supernatural taking place amidst the otherwise worldly mundane - the complexity of matriarchal relationships ever-present and so deeply ingrained in the layers of Brazilian society and religious cults; and the manifestation of characters that evoke and reinvent elements of Brazilian folklore.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/rDMO5gtSZBnKVmwDOqiSECqTikS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ANUNCIAÇÃO.22","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3254358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria
