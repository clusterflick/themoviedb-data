It does not deal with the site of memory but rather memories of the site through the concrete and physical data visible on the ground perceived as a holed-out space mined by disappearance, in particular the buildings, which subsist as ruins. This film is less preoccupied with drawing lessons from history than fuelling the present with a history that, like a blinding mirror, is of the utmost concern.","popularity":0.2737,"poster_path":"/oGW31PQuS75F49Q1ulZTfhgVwgp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War is Looming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Lehman","original_name":"Boris Lehman","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/1CElhTCznn4EcV5rBJoPMixCoqA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Architecte","credit_id":"632b19246ca9a00082979bb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3709808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Cascarosa","original_name":"Antonio Cascarosa","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Espagnol","credit_id":"632b194e39b6c300865298b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3709811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Bensalem","original_name":"Marianne Bensalem","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Harki","credit_id":"632b19f0a3b5e60091f5f632","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3709812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Mathieu","original_name":"Nicole Mathieu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Militante","credit_id":"632b1a07ba480200817204e4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Angelini","original_name":"Claire Angelini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4WT1o8zufGCz2rGET8skLtrUiI7.jpg","credit_id":"632b1788ef9d72009219c9b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2023563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGW31PQuS75F49Q1ulZTfhgVwgp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1631,"name":"concentration camp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Centre Pompidou ","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kino-Ciné","release_date":"2016-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lussas Film Festival","release_date":"2011-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
