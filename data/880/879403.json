Panambi features the stories of bright memories of the past and the despair of having now as a mere memory of the future without a trace of justice; how they lived and what they lived for. A decades-long struggle is shot, one in the lens of a mother paralyzed by fear; another from a mother raged and moved by fear—both looking forward to a better tomorrow.","popularity":0.2896,"poster_path":"/209EMEo1geNfmEnJ9r6fnb1AoKb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Analyn Giganto","original_name":"Analyn Giganto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6154972ffab3fa0020aa2ad5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melly Aquirre","original_name":"Melly Aquirre","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6154973f67dcc9002a6836e2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arden Rod Condez","original_name":"Arden Rod Condez","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/yWY2l2xIfTNfmmc0j25RpffpSSl.jpg","credit_id":"615497b7dcb6a3008bc270d6","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252301,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Myla Angeline Soriaso","original_name":"Myla Angeline Soriaso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615497739f5dfb0042394313","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asher Lance Marañon","original_name":"Asher Lance Marañon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61549800d2147c00632db0e0","department":"Art","job":"Property Master"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252303,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Claire Panisante","original_name":"Claire Panisante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61549821f04d01002b1ae066","department":"Art","job":"Property Master"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252302,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ray Vincent Pelayo","original_name":"Ray Vincent Pelayo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61549813f04d010091ceb22b","department":"Art","job":"Property Master"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jally Nae Gabaliga","original_name":"Jally Nae Gabaliga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6154984a81c7be00439e9a9f","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myra Angeline Soriaso","original_name":"Myra Angeline Soriaso","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kx9MhvNRtlMHhGUB9JnLKuKaSWD.jpg","credit_id":"61549879dd731b008b8c753b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252300,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anne Nicole Occeña","original_name":"Anne Nicole Occeña","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61549764fe6c18008b470bbb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Mariane Biyo","original_name":"Jane Mariane Biyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61733abd0d5d85002ae9c485","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katya Marie Corazon Puertollano","original_name":"Katya Marie Corazon Puertollano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61733aa8a217c0004340c74a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arden Rod Condez","original_name":"Arden Rod Condez","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/yWY2l2xIfTNfmmc0j25RpffpSSl.jpg","credit_id":"61f4231ddfaae9001db455c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"panambi.mothersland","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/209EMEo1geNfmEnJ9r6fnb1AoKb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUPXIWXfj7uNdHnfuuSnlAhbl0L.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wdLWLb4jTBZ02ZN0rJ1jvtHYinY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215162,"name":"indigenous peoples"},{"id":291704,"name":"tumandok"},{"id":291705,"name":"panambi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival -
