Dick novel by the same name, The Galactic Pot Healer is part of the Whispering Pines series, in which Moulton's hypochondriac alter-ego navigates the enigmatic and magical qualities of her personal belongings. In this episode, Cynthia, dressed flamboyantly in a blue velvet robe with green eyeshadow and pink lipstick, follows messages received from household objects during her daily beauty and medicinal routine. These messages direct her to take her broken pot to a mysterious figure known as the Galactic Pot Healer, who, headless and draped in a pink snuggie, reshapes shattered pots with assembly-line efficiency. When the healer tells Cynthia that her pot is beyond repair, the figure offers a massage and a replacement pot is poked and pinched from the skin of her back. Here, a comic, surreal, and uncanny tale takes the form of a sardonic engagement with modern mysticism and healing practices.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/lncOF56zHbRiL6CGE5qdrfF9KLy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Galactic Pot Healer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana Moulton","original_name":"Shana Moulton","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/k2NurtqeeB6ApNp7NDYZb3nmicO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cynthia","credit_id":"65f8a12f8e870201623de88c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana Moulton","original_name":"Shana Moulton","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/k2NurtqeeB6ApNp7NDYZb3nmicO.jpg","credit_id":"61563215a4af8f0044c4666b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lncOF56zHbRiL6CGE5qdrfF9KLy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
