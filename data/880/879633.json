This 340-second \"ghost railroad ride\" shows the view from the back of a train, though I'm not sure if it's heading east or west. This kind of film, in vogue at the time, is an intermediate form of short reality, which often showed a train engaging in a bend, and a feature documentary. Its editing is live, linear and temporal, and the cuts are very apparent. Indeed, the choices of where to place the cuts seem to have avoided the less populated stretches. There are plenty of buildings to see, even when the train is not at the station.","popularity":0.2922,"poster_path":"/uol9YTEmqu4CjY2W80dFF31M2Lv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44771,"logo_path":"/bfyrVfFnmmcanicDhqD9PNxbUHw.png","name":"Charles Urban Trading Company","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1906-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arlberg Railway","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Urban","original_name":"Charles Urban","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/dNxgCHHNpdOWDGDy0YJzs9rAEFA.jpg","credit_id":"64ab16cafa78cd00ffe47948","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3420885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Ormiston-Smith","original_name":"Frank Ormiston-Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ab161b66a0d300ade87cbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1764639","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uol9YTEmqu4CjY2W80dFF31M2Lv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282843,"name":"railway"},{"id":320145,"name":"pioneer cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
