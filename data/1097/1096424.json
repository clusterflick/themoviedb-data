Miles of Smiles chronicles the organizing of the first black trade union - the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. This inspiring story of the Pullman porters provides one of the few accounts of African American working life between the Civil War and World War II.  Describes the harsh discrimination which lay behind the porters' smiling service. Narrator Rosina Tucker, a 100 year old union organizer and porter's widow, describes how after a 12 year struggle led by A. Philip Randolph, the porters won the first contract ever negotiated with black workers. Miles of Smiles both recovers an important chapter in the emergence of black America and reveals a key source of the Civil Rights movement.","popularity":0.1161,"poster_path":"/ArMN6nCOvsbyNjT0L0jNiZipT3N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2030463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wagner","original_name":"Paul Wagner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0606b5ab81a00c5b74ffd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2030463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wagner","original_name":"Paul Wagner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e06075b77d4b113fc6c8ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Santino","original_name":"Jack Santino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406a8c59715ae009ae96cde","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2030463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wagner","original_name":"Paul Wagner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b07ce0d6590b01019d86bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0229582","wikidata_id":"Q6851592","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1207,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArMN6nCOvsbyNjT0L0jNiZipT3N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":340282,"name":"black trade union"},{"id":340283,"name":"brotherhood of sleeping car porters"},{"id":340284,"name":"black america"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Telluride","release_date":"1982-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Miles of Smiles: Years of Struggle","key":"tuL6bFSVcs0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-11-04T00:43:01.000Z","id":"6406aa05f859580085bd7b6e"}]}}}
