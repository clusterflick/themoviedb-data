Soon after their arrival, people begin to disappear. While many might suspect them, some believe in a local legend that the local mental hospital that burned down mysteriously in the late seventies left the unaccounted patients behind to haunt the woods around it. Ultimately, it's left up to Rick to discover what's really going on in their new town and what really hides behind the story of the abandoned asylum that is The Stone House.","popularity":0.1028,"poster_path":"/efc0sfotSF0CZCBjFwaFG7Ch8ou.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195171,"logo_path":null,"name":"cinemagic productions","origin_country":""},{"id":195172,"logo_path":null,"name":"cinova pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"wrong place   ...wrong time.","title":"The Stone House","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"John Wattenbarger's The Stone House","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952647,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeffrey Bader","original_name":"Jeffrey Bader","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6406e9667a4ee700837a4ca2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah McCarron","original_name":"Sarah McCarron","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6406e9a112b10e00b1344664","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ken Denbow","original_name":"Ken Denbow","popularity":0.2154,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6406e9d012b10e00b134467c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominick Scott","original_name":"Dominick Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6406e9e27a4ee700ba59947e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Rowe","original_name":"Rob Rowe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6406ea11f859580085bd9829","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Wattenbarger","original_name":"John Wattenbarger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406e8cc7a4ee700e723ba70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Wattenbarger","original_name":"John Wattenbarger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406e8e712b10e00e1acd87c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Wattenbarger","original_name":"John Wattenbarger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406e8fc12b10e00e1acd88e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952645,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gracin Dorsey","original_name":"Gracin Dorsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406e914afe224007c91fd81","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952646,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Chris Kiker","original_name":"Chris Kiker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406e924f8595800ba20dad6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952647,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeffrey Bader","original_name":"Jeffrey Bader","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6406e93655bc350080f633e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o1vLnjAunRlSsNogamKjxy7KvGi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1331,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efc0sfotSF0CZCBjFwaFG7Ch8ou.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
