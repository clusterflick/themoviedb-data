Centered on the story of the legendary Goat Man - a nomadic figure who spent most of his life walking the roads of Georgia with a wagon pulled by a herd of goats - this experimental documentary weaves together an interview with a goat farmer, footage of the daily rituals Johnson enacted with her own herd, and a poem about the Goat Man’s experimental and spectacular life.","popularity":0.2975,"poster_path":"/ybbKObrim4rqc9M8rGXPhkxPBPO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If it Won’t Hold Water, it Surely Won’t Hold a Goat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3928552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Johnson","original_name":"Erin Johnson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/d2SAjR4xAwXJAJlfGAW57IzE7bs.jpg","credit_id":"64061573392712007cb2a746","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ybbKObrim4rqc9M8rGXPhkxPBPO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":493,"name":"poem"},{"id":2495,"name":"georgia"},{"id":178856,"name":"folklore"},{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":206051,"name":"goats"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":286465,"name":"visual poem"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
