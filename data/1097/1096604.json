The National Weather Bureau learned about it from merchant ships at sea and predicted it would blow itself out at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as such storms usually did. Within 24 hours, the storm ripped into the New England shore with enough fury to set off seismographs in Sitka, Alaska. Traveling at a shocking 60 miles per hour -- three times faster than most tropical storms -- it was astonishingly swift and powerful, with peak wind gusts up to 186 mph. Over 600 people were killed, most by drowning. Another hundred were never found. Property damage was estimated at $400 million -- over 8,000 homes were destroyed, 6,000 boats wrecked or damaged.","popularity":0.6985,"poster_path":"/xDWhLsxzz2EJDAzlSBR7XNhml3K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lennon Documentary Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hurricane of '38","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hurricane of '38 (American Experience)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hurricane of '38: American Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Experience: The Hurricane of '38","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hurricane of 1938","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David McCullough","original_name":"David McCullough","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/wgWz9xD6ZXl547LR4VrSQifsKUr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64a99d9c66a0d300e37331a3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Lennon","original_name":"Thomas Lennon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d1bd1a89300ff807a72","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Lennon","original_name":"Thomas Lennon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d21b686b900cc092037","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Epstein","original_name":"Michael Epstein","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d323e2ec800ec866d90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Epstein","original_name":"Michael Epstein","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d3cd1a89300e2f8ab57","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1627481,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ken Eluto","original_name":"Ken Eluto","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d459c97bd00c5f7b278","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240662,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gregory Andracke","original_name":"Gregory Andracke","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d53d1a8930139d5d4ac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean de Segonzac","original_name":"Jean de Segonzac","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/hh8hRu4aj2vJn2qX0x0pAvNj5BX.jpg","credit_id":"64a99d5dd1a89300ff807a8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143066,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Hurwitz","original_name":"Tom Hurwitz","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d679c97bd00e24c0034","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1039165,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dow McKeever","original_name":"Dow McKeever","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d71d1a89300ff807a97","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116085,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Bacon","original_name":"Michael Bacon","popularity":0.1711,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99d796a344800ad7565c4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vDVyltZ6BPkwk5dvQRGKBSSXJ2j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xDWhLsxzz2EJDAzlSBR7XNhml3K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5096,"name":"natural disaster"},{"id":14527,"name":"storm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2007-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
