His slow-motion movements, as well as the position of the body, vaguely suggest that an intimate encounter is involved. The fetish figure in leather becomes a visual conundrum that infuses one image with desire while being content with remaining an object. Two fingers slowly bring the cigarette to his lips; he inhales and smiles under his cap. His counterpart shows no reaction.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom & Tom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Brehm","original_name":"Dietmar Brehm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zkYe7thFoRbgLnGvB0yN33CAsS6.jpg","credit_id":"64073ee19715ae00d8f5b6fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
