They do their work by standing by the side of people when they are in grief, and are the last hands to touch the grave towel that lowers the deceased a meter and a half below the ground. Alongside other ancient professions, gravediggers have inherited knowledge and skills through several generations - not only in digging holes, but also in Latvia's rich cemetery culture, where everything has its own order. Latvia's cemeteries are where traditions from different centuries meet, and every gravedigger needs to know them so that he or she can continue to receive the stamps for the job of digging graves. The most experienced of them have already received 5 000 such stamps, which is equivalent to the population of one town in Latvia.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":"/7UYbuWnc7eMJvGwrrcxw1lrSczZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentarian","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2024-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravediggers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3725967,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krists Auznieks","original_name":"Krists Auznieks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e39c957ef381209daa5680","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2484409,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Haralds Ozols","original_name":"Haralds Ozols","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e39ca28566d200c6f63aad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Zviedris","original_name":"Ivars Zviedris","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nwLWM3dH7coDqlXzJgylb0uFegA.jpg","credit_id":"64e39cb5b77d4b1141fb0dbd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4495605,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Daniela Grape","original_name":"Emma Daniela Grape","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65afa949848eb900ac9ce66a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198974,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ģirts Bišs","original_name":"Ģirts Bišs","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65afa95fd100b600ada6beab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Zviedris","original_name":"Ivars Zviedris","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nwLWM3dH7coDqlXzJgylb0uFegA.jpg","credit_id":"65afa97339756100afd08516","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Zviedris","original_name":"Ivars Zviedris","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nwLWM3dH7coDqlXzJgylb0uFegA.jpg","credit_id":"6407a1f2945d36021ed144c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28610065","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7UYbuWnc7eMJvGwrrcxw1lrSczZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1996}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ArtDocFest Riga","release_date":"2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gravediggers | Baltic Focus Competition | IDFF Artdocfest/Riga 2024 | Trailer","key":"Dh3UNEm42Rc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-23T13:34:35.000Z","id":"65e35fceb7a154018678efd8"}]}}}
