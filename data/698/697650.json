A dear friend, the Italian tenor Vittorio GrigÃ³lo, arrives breathlessly and asks the Prince, who is half Neapolitan, for advice on the best rendering of the famous song \"O Paese d'o Sole\" with in the background the version by Roberto Murolo, the unmistakable voice and sophisticated performer of the tradition.  The difficulty is obviously not technical for the great tenor but lies in looking for that expressivity and passion in interpretation that has made this musical form, deriving from great Italian melodrama, one of the best loved in the world.","popularity":0.1084,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caruso presents: The Good Italian III - The Magic of Naples","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giancarlo Giannini","original_name":"Giancarlo Giannini","popularity":1.0061,"profile_path":"/xsnoThKUjFlhmvXKS4ZqAx1x3zb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Principe","credit_id":"5ea6a5f3a2d2e90018df16ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriano De Santis","original_name":"Adriano De Santis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea6a635a2d2e90018df16eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6470874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
