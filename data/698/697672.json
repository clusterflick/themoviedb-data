The project is inspired by the book \"Species of Spaces\" by the French novelist, filmmaker, documentalist, and essayist, Georges Perec and the days of quarantine. The idea is to create a film at home, using the environment, the people or the animals in that space. The only outdoor areas that may be used are outdoor living spaces, such as the terrace, the garden, the balcony and the stairwell. \"My other lives\" is Marianna Economou's submission.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/woTggA24v6x8MG1SWcFzhwUu72d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My other lives","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1163324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianna Economou","original_name":"Μαριάννα Οικονόμου","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yuOlyZfKspVhFlT8U8qdzsYqzZr.jpg","credit_id":"5ea6b083db72c0001dbe9203","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/woTggA24v6x8MG1SWcFzhwUu72d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"Thessaloniki International Film Festival - YouTube","release_date":"2020-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
