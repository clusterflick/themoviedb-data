The film detailed abuse suffered by children between the 1930s and 1970s in the state childcare system of Ireland, primarily in the Reformatory and Industrial Schools. After public outcry, Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern apologised on behalf of the State. The film sparked a national scandal over abuse of children in church and state run institutions. It led to a major commission on child abuse that sat from 2000 to 2009.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/FkP8Kuzok8XhaIzFSoWl2oyYmU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"States of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Áine Lawlor","original_name":"Áine Lawlor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ea6cbd518b751002539fcf8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616485,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oisín Kelly","original_name":"Oisín Kelly","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea6cc09db72c0001dbeb077","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Raftery","original_name":"Mary Raftery","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea6cbf0ec45520027418c00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616487,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shiela Ahern","original_name":"Shiela Ahern","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea6cc1ab39e350026ea2632","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0281225","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1268,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/FkP8Kuzok8XhaIzFSoWl2oyYmU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
