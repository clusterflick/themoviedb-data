Buried under thick, unseemly glasses and an endlessly dazed expression, Ezra’s worst enemy is basketball. Unable to make a single basket under the brutal pressures of his vulgar gym teacher (“You’re shit, Schatt!”), Ezra also fails at both impressing the cheerleader of his dreams and realizing his aspirations of attending MIT.","popularity":0.0551,"poster_path":"/8uDupQLuWrxefkPr2TqInRf5tO5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schatt's Last Shot","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Todd Solondz","original_name":"Todd Solondz","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/2j8pTtI3ybgroqBEyHxymFZztjR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ezra Schatt","credit_id":"627f9e816d000c0067ed6cfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3549155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Scaccio","original_name":"Cheryl Scaccio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bunny","credit_id":"627f9eca006eee5250acd1f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3549158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brucha Balanevsky","original_name":"Brucha Balanevsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ezra's grandmother","credit_id":"627f9ef4caa50813cfa9db27","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Todd Solondz","original_name":"Todd Solondz","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/2j8pTtI3ybgroqBEyHxymFZztjR.jpg","credit_id":"60cbc1f7b0040a0029c194c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Todd Solondz","original_name":"Todd Solondz","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/2j8pTtI3ybgroqBEyHxymFZztjR.jpg","credit_id":"5ea7b45ed38b58001e275dbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0306049","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8uDupQLuWrxefkPr2TqInRf5tO5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b8Be2UdvjeSpbmp5EMRApL9xcdK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
