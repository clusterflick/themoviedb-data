Every chief of State and everyone who is someone in the money world meets with their peers in the Swiss village. What is really at stake in Davos ? Julia Niemann and Daniel Hoesl create a fascinating observational documentary in which judgement is never handed out and where the dialectics of conflicts matter more than easy and reassuring answers. The film asks the viewer some uncomfortable questions by focusing on challenges that the new global economy poses to the world.","popularity":0.393,"poster_path":"/nBN16BYwQvdKIIpYletpQ1zeZEW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155392,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Film
