Partic­u­larly notice­able this year are the numerous video and sound works. One that sticks in your memory is Haris Epaminonda’s “Chimera” (2019). In her 30-minute film, she combines found-footage shots with a sound­scape by Kelly Jayne Jones and creates medi­ta­tive images of aban­doned places and land­scapes, which hover some­where between memory and concep­tual construc­tion. The work deservedly earned Epaminonda the Silver Lion.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/mq1CmI4XtoIuAaeumDhv9WLukD2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chimera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haris Epaminonda","original_name":"Haris Epaminonda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea7a40f2d1e40001f831a2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mq1CmI4XtoIuAaeumDhv9WLukD2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i8VLMU3AWRMHI6eewhdYCRgeMy5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
