But, if we appreciate them today, this was not always the case. In this documentary, director Olivier Monssens acts as the spokesperson for his compatriots. Through testimonies and delicious archive images, he returns to the not-so-distant era when our neighbors were considered friendly but somewhat idiotic people. The film is also an opportunity to understand what characterizes the Belgian spirit by focusing on some of its facets: humor and its famous local variation, self-deprecation, cinema and music.","popularity":0.2948,"poster_path":"/wpyc9EZlS7vcJxTQ5rFfjodLTd1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48511,"logo_path":"/s1SdauimBTWstbskDE6yu3P44yn.png","name":"Kaos
