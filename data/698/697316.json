Brought up in a remote, poverty-stricken town in Yorkshire, without money or opportunity, they fought ill-health, unrequited love and family feuds to write some of the most celebrated literature including Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.  Never afraid to rebel against expectations, the lives behind the pages expose a struggling, squabbling, ferociously driven, drug-fuelled crash and burn trajectory from obscurity to celebrity and ultimately to their untimely deaths. Coupled with a rock score from Christopher Ash (Showstoppers – Oliver Award winner for Best Entertainment), book and lyrics by Carl Miller (Emil and the Detectives, National Theatre), directed by Adam Lenson (Superhero – Off-West End Award for New Musical), the Brontës ask – was it all wasted?","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":"/iEWrq6xwRTnSshxA5fvmuNmlZnL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southwark Playhouse Wasted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2615516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siobhan Athwal","original_name":"Siobhan Athwal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea577855a4690001f119b26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2615517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha J.
