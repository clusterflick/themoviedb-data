Her day-to-day  routine involves listening to an old grammar phone and the  catching and killing of butterflies in vicious traps that hang  from her window. One day, this routine is disrupted as a curious  young girl enters her garden unexpectedly. Cynthia  is besotted by the girlsâ€™ grace, youth and beauty and in her  deranged, intoxicated state, decides to kidnap her using the  chloroform that she uses on her butterflies, and on herself  recreationally.","popularity":0.5802,"poster_path":"/nYqjXZgHjGzkb4BwjloAGPhVle5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
