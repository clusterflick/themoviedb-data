He says, unequivocally, he is not religious; but he laughs off the idea that heaven doesn’t exist. For him the truth is something unknowable, something in between. The intimate film follows him not only as he tackles these big topics, but as he eats in his kitchen, creates music in his studio, and walks around his neighborhood, Quinto Do Mocho in Lisbon, shooting the shit with his friends about dating girls. Simmering beneath these domestic scenes, darkly omnipresent, are two intertwined things: the tight, dense percussion of Firmeza’s music, and the subject of his father, who passed away in 2015.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pai Nosso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DJ Firmeza","original_name":"DJ Firmeza","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ea74f2efdc146001da2f559","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616995,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Cohen","original_name":"John Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74faf514c4a00218acd19","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715014,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stuart Winecoff","original_name":"Stuart Winecoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74fc407291c0025ea252a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2409629,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rita Costa","original_name":"Rita Costa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea75051bb070d001ca718cb","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616994,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Stone","original_name":"Rob Stone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74f9abe55b7001de404e8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana da Conceição","original_name":"Joana da Conceição","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74fd607291c001eea3167","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clayton Vomero","original_name":"Clayton Vomero","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74f84be55b7001fe4077e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clayton Vomero","original_name":"Clayton Vomero","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74ee8514c4a001f8ac66b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616999,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Beckwith","original_name":"Dan Beckwith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea75018d38b580026270424","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2384186,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mikey Rossiter","original_name":"Mikey Rossiter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/fXZQQKDmKconXJgZs3PjtCThZW6.jpg","credit_id":"5ea75001be55b7001fe408c3","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2427101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Monteiro","original_name":"Paulo Monteiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea7503d2d1e40001f82cfc3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1017298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Grove Carter","original_name":"Thomas Grove Carter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74fe9b76cbb001ae3ea5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970453,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diane McArter","original_name":"Diane McArter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea74f75514c4a00218acc8b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2617005,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jorge Cabanelas","original_name":"Jorge Cabanelas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea7507d426ae800264826ea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
