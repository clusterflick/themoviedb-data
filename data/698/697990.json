It's about history, technology, memory, chaos theory, Canada, eyesight, books, trains, speed, death, and Saskatchewan. The film is visually as eclectic as its narration, including documentation (photos, paintings, diagrams, maps); footage of trains, tracks, classrooms and libraries; and stop-motion animation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is the end of me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2617506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Thompson","original_name":"Kim Thompson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea7c8e6be55b70021e4795f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
