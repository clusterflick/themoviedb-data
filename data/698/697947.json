For his TV documentary “Die Sache mit der Realität. Eine Collage über Dokumentarfilm” (1996), Lothar Schuster had a long conversation with Farocki, whom he had known since the late 1960s. Farocki discusses the idea of the Enlightenment, the compositional patterns of his films, the relationship between image and text. Ingo Kratisch, responsible for the camera in many of Farocki’s films between 1977 and his death, used his photo and film camera to record casual observations during the shooting of “The Creators of Shopping Worlds”(2001), “In Comparison”(2009), “Serious Games”(2009/10) and other films. In HARUN FAROCKI – TAKE TWO, Schuster’s and Kratisch’s footage alternates; discourse and observation comment and complement each other. On the one hand the gradual construction of thoughts during speech, on the other the act of patiently waiting, making pauses and preparing to shoot.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pRFdD7CygIiC8dd0nhMr461NiFK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harun Farocki - Take Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2164812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lothar Schuster","original_name":"Lothar Schuster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea7a6a7be55b7001de45723","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Kratisch","original_name":"Ingo Kratisch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea7a69acc96830023ae5e82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pRFdD7CygIiC8dd0nhMr461NiFK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
