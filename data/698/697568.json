It is an expos√© on a rising subculture of Black and Latino gay youth representing the Hip-Hop generation. The people portrayed maintain the aggressive hyper masculine image and attitude represented in the Hip-Hop culture, yet they are gay, thus contradicting the stereotypical image of homosexuals. Through the eyes of these males, known as homo thugs, we see gay rappers, Blood gang members, pimps, and prostitutes in their struggle to maintain dignity as gay minorities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9Dy7oc3qGmGD8fA6hiudYVXBGJs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life on Christopher Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Clara","original_name":"Maria Clara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea62a07b39e35001fe963fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0345577","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Dy7oc3qGmGD8fA6hiudYVXBGJs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
