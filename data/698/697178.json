No sooner has he gone than the artist begins to remove all his furniture by sliding it down a plank which he has placed across the window of his friends apartments just opposite. They help him over his difficulty and just as the last piece goes on, and the artist has safely followed it, the landlord arrives and also tries to cross the plank. Just as he is in the middle of it, they twist the plank and down he goes, falling on the head of a pastry cook, whom he proceeds to thrash for being in the way. Very laughable and highly recommended.
