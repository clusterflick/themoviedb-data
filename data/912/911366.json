A at first sight harmless parlor game, the aim of which is to rewrite words as quickly as possible, turns out to be a concentrated family drama in which the unsaid becomes an increasingly large mental cinema. Who is playing with whom, who understands what? A power imbalance placed in the alleged garden idyll of the average family - cards on the table!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
