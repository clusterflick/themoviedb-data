As a perfect complement he also had a literary diary. Both form a unique testimonial chronicle: how to read the script and see what was filmed. This documentary deals with that lesser-known area of Díaz's work.","popularity":0.1775,"poster_path":"/4LBenusqqmVW3Jw3P6yj1vq8VXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cordón Films","origin_country":"UY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2021-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Filmador","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aldo Garay","original_name":"Aldo Garay","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pcBH3jKTXmJpdSoOgWYvwA2GEL.jpg","credit_id":"61ab95cdac8e6b006466b42e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305582,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micaela Solé","original_name":"Micaela Solé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab95758efe730041f27cde","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2311371,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Federico La Rosa","original_name":"Federico La Rosa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab95a4d6d64d005ffa50ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Yafalián","original_name":"Daniel Yafalián","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/9sT6KdnxVX2IsepTqpfdQRqwVXC.jpg","credit_id":"61ab95c00dea6e0090cf2f8f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aldo Garay","original_name":"Aldo Garay","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pcBH3jKTXmJpdSoOgWYvwA2GEL.jpg","credit_id":"61ab95628efe73005fb6a483","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2311368,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"German De Leon","original_name":"German De Leon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab959222e480008e79d89f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Yafalián","original_name":"Daniel Yafalián","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/9sT6KdnxVX2IsepTqpfdQRqwVXC.jpg","credit_id":"61ab95b3bf09d10068e6fcb4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4LBenusqqmVW3Jw3P6yj1vq8VXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1329}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
