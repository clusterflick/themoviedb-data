She devises a prank whereby she asks her close friend, Radha, to impersonate her and visit a young man, who her dad has chosen for her to marry. Radha agrees to do so, and visits Harry and his mom at their palatial house. Radha soon wins over Harry's mom, and eventually she and Harry also fall in love. When Meeta's dad, Jagat Murari, informs of his visit, Radha realizes that it is now time to depart, and desperately attempts to contact Meeta, but in vain. Radha then packs up her bags and departs, leaving Harry wondering what this was all about. Harry then comes across Radha, only this time she is with a male named Vinod Kumar, who claims that Radha is his wife.","popularity":0.1915,"poster_path":"/7WSO2EQJ2LsTDb60UWS8YYu6jMp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105981,"logo_path":null,"name":"R M K Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shararat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biswajeet Chatterjee","original_name":"Biswajeet Chatterjee","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/n0ncJ4xeBNkgqGh67HIbeimzQ1z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"61ab6f5d8efe73008240e2ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mumtaz Askari","original_name":"Mumtaz Askari","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/kRTne3xijE9qA2G2xyKkQj6G8mN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Radha / Meeta","credit_id":"61ab6f696728a80041a4c3ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":625415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sujit Kumar","original_name":"Sujit Kumar","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/fEYuewE7qp5kFiSJD1oDulVDO8i.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vinod Kumar","credit_id":"61ab6f78cb75d10063203927","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shatrughan Sinha","original_name":"Shatrughan Sinha","popularity":0.4567,"profile_path":"/qPjI1TdA2cYAcvSOUveCSYGOHmy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jagdish / Vinod Kumar","credit_id":"61ab6f860b5fd6001918a20c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raj Mehra","original_name":"Raj Mehra","popularity":0.1861,"profile_path":"/jtw0vHAc31coBEdpyBbwar83taq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jagat Murari","credit_id":"61ab6f90b3e627001cf77f26","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1032597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehmood Jr.","original_name":"Mehmood Jr.","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/ewRnxyjrHsTPG1mrYT6jUr2C6fO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narad","credit_id":"61ab6f9d6350130091b685b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":230972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Durga Khote","original_name":"Durga Khote","popularity":0.5037,"profile_path":"/hyQIVmAkauqtZGuiHOxv0ggYU5B.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Harry's mom","credit_id":"61ab6fac0cd44600882d3863","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033772,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ratan Mohan","original_name":"Ratan Mohan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab6fcffe5c91001ce1e37a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"K.B.
