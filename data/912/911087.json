Hanna does not find the meaning of life in a world where values and communication have been lost. Klaus, her husband, has a hard time understanding her and struggles to save the marriage that is threatened. In a pub they meet a young poet, Heinz, reciting Rilke, Hölderlin and Baudelaire. Hanna sees in him the opportunity to get away from this troubled world and will want to climb on his wide wings. From that moment on, the marriage goes adrift, led by Hanna's dreams and Klaus's rationality. A story of love, madness and poetry.","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":"/2lKAywPUgPD8zNNjPykN1MFyb5b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meddle Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2008-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flowers on the Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elke Orlob","original_name":"Elke Orlob","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61a978604a52f800446ffde9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esteban Grossy","original_name":"Esteban Grossy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61a9786605822400266fd924","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Azaravicius","original_name":"Bettina Azaravicius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61a9786d0486380065c21131","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Viña","original_name":"Daniel Viña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61a9787b0816c7008b94cfeb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3326173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar A.
