Instead it points to rapid accumulation of plant debris through catastrophic global water deposition. Experiments demonstrate it takes as little as a few days to turn buried plant debris into coal, and produce oil from coal and organic debris. The evidence thus confirms the recent, rapid formation of coal and oil as a result of the Biblical Flood!","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/lmJpLN3bpMZYJIPrdlzgkiUDrcx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recent Rapid Formation of Coal and Oil","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3294949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Snelling","original_name":"Andrew Snelling","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/14yjw3D58nDXpWAkLlo2tEOdiF5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"61a97d127ecd28006882e856","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":830,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lmJpLN3bpMZYJIPrdlzgkiUDrcx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
