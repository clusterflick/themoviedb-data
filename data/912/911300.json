These people or events tend to be those that suck us of our energy, deplete us of our power, and stray us from our path. Though through every struggle comes a voice within that helps you overcome the hurdles. Cuttin' the cord is a song of release, a fighter song, a song of regaining your own power and discovering your true potential and following your inner voice. Putting your foot down and creating those necessary boundaries. Fighting against those who hold us down or tell us we are no good. Those who keep us in bound and stagnant energy while we try to discover our purpose here during our short time on Earth. The video is a symbolic artistic expression of these things.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/4rfwSHBNkrlvEfp1sAWc6nETL09.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lunarcode: Cuttin' the Cord","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3334108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Gillette","original_name":"Jessica Gillette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61aa50e5c5c1ef0045007c25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3334109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincenzo Carubia","original_name":"Vincenzo Carubia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61aa51004a52f8008e247e3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14253034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4rfwSHBNkrlvEfp1sAWc6nETL09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5699,"name":"music video"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2021","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
