It intertwines that which I witness with that which I imagine. A perceptual blur arises, where the freakish quietly morphs into the everyday. I am working in the area of unnatural history in an intervened place. Cycles of time are disrupted, and loss is complicated with the spark of possibilities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fEFlAycDq6RruwtOHKozGT5Rg34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Season of Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Crafts","original_name":"Lisa Crafts","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ac378115dea00064ba50e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5139322","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fEFlAycDq6RruwtOHKozGT5Rg34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
