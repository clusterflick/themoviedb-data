Detailed computer animations show how the intricate “machinery” working in a single cell can only be explained as the handiwork of the Master Designer.  The cells of our bodies exhibit many amazing designs. They are miniature factories that perform thousands of jobs every second! In this DVD, Dr. Purdom explores the complexities and inner working of the cell using visually stunning animations. Journey through the bloodstream to investigate how white blood cells eliminate a bacterial infection. You will encounter proteins that literally “walk” down cellular “highways” and cells that dramatically change their shape. As a result, you will gain a greater appreciation for love and the designs of Creator God.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/v197UkDRcV8jU1mhFqQ6uEJZI28.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder of the Cell","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61aadae50b5fd6005e946cd0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651972909d592c00c8c33f53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519728b93bd6900c4df5ebf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3830168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v197UkDRcV8jU1mhFqQ6uEJZI28.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
