Geological and political memory, without centre and without end, which returns in the family films assembled here following a logic of displacements, dispersions, discordances between sound and image. The screen is divided in two, as in the old stereoscopic devices, but the images do not overlap to create a single vision. Instead, they meet in the distance that separates them, as do the people portrayed on them: a group of women in an occupied factory, a woman in an elegant dress looking at herself in a mirror, a baby kicking, little girls posing for their first communion. The rhythm is the discontinuous one of a memory that brings reality and imagination together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/inCTJfugDYBTaPRGmb33tBDX3SV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallax Dash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Domietta Torlasco","original_name":"Domietta Torlasco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61abb0f9a84a470061984153","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/inCTJfugDYBTaPRGmb33tBDX3SV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
