He is also believed to have committed the rape and murder of up to fifty-one other boys and young men. Kraft is currently incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, California. He became known as the “Scorecard Killer” because, inside his car trunk, investigators found a ring binder containing a hand-written list of 61 coded notations about his victims and more than 50 photographs of young men (dead or asleep) in pornographic poses beneath the carpet. He was also known the “Freeway Killer” because many of his victims’ bodies were discovered near freeways.","popularity":0.1008,"poster_path":"/p5Jl6dHqzdx08j8R2MEoc3r72wk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enchanted Architect","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"61: Scorecard Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"TetroManiac: 61 - Scorecard Killer","type":"Alternative Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Scorza","original_name":"Roberto Scorza","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/bLL3MWywOMVE7p6cvpZaIQ3p7Dj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61e6440257176f001945bb12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2899539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Arturi","original_name":"Daniele Arturi","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61e6440e0cd32a0042fd0c03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3060383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex D'Alascio","original_name":"Alex D'Alascio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61e64416db8a00001c2e60ce","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Domiziano Cristopharo","original_name":"Domiziano Cristopharo","popularity":0.3126,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab9c0e0dea6e006211413a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1433593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poison Rouge","original_name":"Poison Rouge","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab9c040f2ae100421cf73c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472331,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antony Coia","original_name":"Antony Coia","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9232ed4c444a1cc99c704","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Domiziano Cristopharo","original_name":"Domiziano Cristopharo","popularity":0.3126,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f92339a04f530b5c9922fe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695979,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Athanasius Pernath","original_name":"Athanasius Pernath","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f923517f70ac1a21d956b1","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Special Effects Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1433593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poison Rouge","original_name":"Poison Rouge","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f924a31bc639566ada230e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Domiziano Cristopharo","original_name":"Domiziano Cristopharo","popularity":0.3126,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f924aed4c444a1cc99c809","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13684506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p5Jl6dHqzdx08j8R2MEoc3r72wk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bAUF49ZhcP6WNLbM9H1e5s3KxS8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TetroManiac: 61 – Scorecard Killer (Italy – 2021) - Trailer","key":"0VK8WTTZWhg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-02T13:15:35.000Z","id":"66a8eb0165780b6119cd1608"}]}}}
