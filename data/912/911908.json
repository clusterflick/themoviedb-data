Encouraged by the townspeople and his brother, Bankhe, he re-locates to Bombay, where in a few years time he is able to successfully complete his studies and become a doctor. When he returns home, nothing is the same anymore. His brother Bankhe is absconding, running away from Daku Jwala, who has sworn to kill him to avenge his brother's death - and Dr. Ravi himself has to face Jwala sooner or later - as Jwala's vengeance includes Bankhe and all of his family. Dr. Ravi must now make up his mind to look death at the hands of an angry Jwala - or re-locate and practice medicine elsewhere.","popularity":0.2218,"poster_path":"/qS40aPC9JZLVgMXooF3Y3MtkI9X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jwaala Daaku","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2012453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahendra Sandhu","original_name":"Mahendra Sandhu","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jwala","credit_id":"61ac8aed534661008b110763","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asha Sachdev","original_name":"Asha Sachdev","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/kQnrm4uXt4YQNQw4jTkOAlg6K5f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bijli","credit_id":"61ac8af6aa659e008e00b4b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farida Jalal","original_name":"Farida Jalal","popularity":1.151,"profile_path":"/tJdqL4BRSAWVFX1W6cmwxFs9IFh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sita (Jwala's sister-in-law)","credit_id":"61ac8b03d207f30064c884f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shashi Puri","original_name":"Shashi Puri","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Ravi","credit_id":"61ac8b3bd207f300923bbfb7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3336333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gouri Khurana","original_name":"Gouri Khurana","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Champa - Jwala's Sister","credit_id":"61ac8b59596a910061048e8a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rehana Sultan","original_name":"Rehana Sultan","popularity":0.1688,"profile_path":"/h7DtkYiYMJJP03wajL3eFrbTVDb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rambhabai","credit_id":"61ac8b65d207f3001c090e9d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":601266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ranjeet Bedi","original_name":"Ranjeet Bedi","popularity":0.4014,"profile_path":"/fEMTpkUtx29RYBOVTEoXo8BRElC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jwala's brother","credit_id":"61ac8b74a6ddcb004353ddd2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":593128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narendra Nath","original_name":"Narendra Nath","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":"/99viffH7ts7OO7JZjdWqNdOr15f.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mangal","credit_id":"61ac8b93149565005c2d73fc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sudhir","original_name":"Sudhir","popularity":0.2862,"profile_path":"/d4WTm0unLFeVhBHXokDxjiGtJua.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bankhe","credit_id":"61ac8ba67f6c8d008e90d74d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sudhir Dalvi","original_name":"Sudhir Dalvi","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/bESGpvnujk8K59nCYojfh5v5qka.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rahim","credit_id":"61ac8bb515dea00064bab8af","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mala Jaggi","original_name":"Mala Jaggi","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"61ac8bc6c072a2001d1805f2","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tun Tun","original_name":"Tun Tun","popularity":0.2397,"profile_path":"/y2ORD7WlbDnMVdlKbmq1dAMdeUm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Raamkali","credit_id":"61ac8bd6534661006052c2fd","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.P.
