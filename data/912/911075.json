By the time he came to Rochester, Frank had made seven films and was in production on the autobiographical fiction About Me: A Musical while preparing to shoot the controversial Rolling Stones documentary Cocksucker Blues. In need of money to shoot his next film, Frank proposed a non-traditional course to friend Nathan Lyons, suggesting the students work together to make their own movie with Frank acting as more of a collaborator than an instructor. Frank’s approach to working with the group of six students was simple: load up a camera and start shooting the world around you, including yourselves. The resulting 38 minute film is a valuable portrait of a creative collaboration between artists, and a stimulating document of what Frank  refers to as ‘the chaos of the present.’","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Frank","original_name":"Robert Frank","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/4UhHEdJhdh3wBhe87ZmPGPahKnY.jpg","credit_id":"61a96afe05822400912c95fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
