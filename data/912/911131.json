Working with his second wife, the editor Peggy Lawson, he made four short films comprising The Art of Seeing Series. The films, made without words, are beautiful poems to the pleasure of sight. This film came as a challenge that Hurwitz made for himself, to replicate in film his experience of seeing a work of art — in this case Césanne’s Still Life with Apples, 1895-98, that hangs in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Although he finished the visual part of the film, he was stymied by the soundtrack in which he wanted no narration. About 45 years later, his colleague, Manfred Kirchheimer, created a sound track and produced the finished film.","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":"/cWUeiALAbqAMikVLhHizPMB8IiX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Streetwise Fil","origin_country":""},{"id":159718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leo Hurwitz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discovery in a Painting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Hurwitz","original_name":"Leo Hurwitz","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mk3yshXb2ZMUSeV6DLc0BhuA29.jpg","credit_id":"61a9abe6383df200647ee153","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"61a9abf7d2f5b500452c2f83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Hurwitz","original_name":"Leo Hurwitz","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mk3yshXb2ZMUSeV6DLc0BhuA29.jpg","credit_id":"61a9ac134a52f8008e23d6af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Hurwitz","original_name":"Leo Hurwitz","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mk3yshXb2ZMUSeV6DLc0BhuA29.jpg","credit_id":"61a9ac5a1f33190088d3362f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"61a9ac80a6a4c1004498203c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"61a9ac8f180dea009888caf3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cWUeiALAbqAMikVLhHizPMB8IiX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
