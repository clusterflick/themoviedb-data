His body was discovered a few days later by the Soviets. He would be positively identified after a top secret inquest in which Hitler's personal dentist would play a central role. And yet, at the same time, Stalin publicly declared that his army was unable to find the Führer's body, choosing to let the wildest rumors develop and going so far as to accuse some of his Allies of having aided the monster's probable escape. What secrets were hidden behind this dissimulation? What happened then to the two ladies involved in the identification of Hitler’s body?","popularity":0.6689,"poster_path":"/5XjcJ0HJNcxHHSPzy3y4ERjfuY0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Betula Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death of Hitler: The Story of a State Secret","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Tissot","original_name":"Pierre Tissot","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5facf8c2111da10042828bbd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2837196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Bozon","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Bozon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facf87790ea4b003f9d1f88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2837194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Beliaeva","original_name":"Nina Beliaeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facf897075288004162e93c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16476938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pIbwFdjuZcc0zjCEHyYjyuzWCfJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ma1pndyGz7z651rwOT0zOyWoAGW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5XjcJ0HJNcxHHSPzy3y4ERjfuY0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/raaCyt9t1wezDp7zz18OppTrC8w.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wkEKduayAYGoEJS1segyKWlJxLq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6V1A4c3lIAiVlKtPFuu1RZ7YDjA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":5340,"name":"investigation"},{"id":241930,"name":"adolf hitler"},{"id":248955,"name":"suicide investigation"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"},{"id":320824,"name":"plot to kill hitler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RMC Découverte","release_date":"2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
