Minimal variations in their movement can be seen. The screen gradually lightens, and a roughly hewn wooden structure becomes visible. The light-colored rectangles turn out to be window openings of a log cabin with luminous white interior walls which is swiftly rotating on its axis. Subtle changes in the light and the camera´s distance and angle transform this presumably abstract animation into a concrete setup for a filmic and architectural experiment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bZb3g2wqvW8vYUp2L4S8bow7JGa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gyre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Björn Kämmerer","original_name":"Björn Kämmerer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58feb9e1c3a36853140020b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bZb3g2wqvW8vYUp2L4S8bow7JGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
