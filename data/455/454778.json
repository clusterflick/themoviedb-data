De la Pera was a talented photographer, always willing to try new gadgets and techniques. This film experiments with microphotography in the style of Jean Comandon's films for Pathé and it is part of a series which included a film about mosquitoes and paludism and another one about cancer, which are considered lost. Flies were a popular subject of silent films and there are more than a dozen titles featuring them in the teens and early twenties.","popularity":0.2598,"poster_path":"/vCSAsxJIPdLrz0YlWrBWjnNDUEA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1920-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dangers of the Fly","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Ernesto Gunche","original_name":"Enrique Ernesto Gunche","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59027178925141264100008f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Martínez de la Pera","original_name":"Eduardo Martínez de la Pera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5902718d92514126560000b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8070554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vCSAsxJIPdLrz0YlWrBWjnNDUEA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0CUSCmGDFGIllLDnPl2rGTovko.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2878,"name":"scientific study"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La mosca y sus peligros 1920","key":"QWRxm0JQiAk","published_at":"2010-06-06T15:44:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"5904768892514169e100b4e2"}]}}}
