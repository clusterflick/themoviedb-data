Where to go to work? After working as a stand-by in a local recreation-and-entertainment park, he tries himself as a proof-reader in typography, a laboratory assistant in a plant and exhausts all his stock of photos for passes.

A work which brings so much happiness both to him and to other people.","popularity":0.218,"poster_path":"/npbnA0GCRiXwkhwZwIx9VmkxOHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11436,"logo_path":"/oP91a5RrDqF0vYDT09pNKc9dKkf.png","name":"Sverdlovsk Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1974-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What a Smile You Got","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kakaya u Vas Ulybka","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksei Mokrousov","original_name":"Алексей Мокроусов","popularity":0.0515,"profile_path":"/9IfB0qBviRPjV5S86mRwoRuq4gr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sergey","credit_id":"58ff69499251413b03000241","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Shirvindt","original_name":"Александр Ширвиндт","popularity":0.2046,"profile_path":"/jdK4Wx35zxNnYOKFMwzXyrZAl9O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Father","credit_id":"58ff6a24c3a3685f8e0002a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":138127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Kivi","original_name":"Eve Kivi","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/qhjimuWlMdlIh2Z4mCE8L7BkKJO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"58ff6a36c3a3685f2f000280","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Puzyryov","original_name":"Юрий Пузырёв","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":"/mCG0eDTvgTxWZ0uuQB8zRCgUs1m.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kirill","credit_id":"58ff6a449251413ae20002c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Mironova","original_name":"Мария Миронова","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/r1uj3XhKjTTtlsi73v0kWaCs1kk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"58ff6a4e9251413af60002af","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Demertash","original_name":"Віктор Демерташ","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/asWwb9cEsrburHpH3nuiYcl1rDy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Petya, radio installer","credit_id":"619f8b1652dc7f00873f4f78","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nataliya Bogunova","original_name":"Наталия Богунова","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/tyIO4SsOtfDdNKi5DEuisvncaeA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Solomina, the typesetter who sings","credit_id":"619f8bd35e1200008df71f73","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Sperantova","original_name":"Валентина Сперантова","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/rAgjBApCQjaKL607WRZbi8FUZjE.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Baba Varya, Sergei's grandmother","credit_id":"619f8c119ae6130065ea9266","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Filatov","original_name":"Igor Filatov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Stasik, Seryozha's neighbor","credit_id":"619f8c5d8de0ae0042339e05","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Doronina II","original_name":"Tatiana Doronina II","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"girl, in a trolleybus and a hairdresser","credit_id":"619f8d1ec0ae360062208225","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82592,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Valutskiy","original_name":"Владимир Валуцкий","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/Cc1OOAwnFUZkGUzqUJsr3ucdwb.jpg","credit_id":"58ff6932c3a3685f8100020d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1280562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Nikolayevsky","original_name":"Oleg Nikolayevsky","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/5UYqj6E3KGZeNSj59Pm69r5dMph.jpg","credit_id":"58ff69279251413af6000222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0218372","wikidata_id":"Q110028684","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djqSxpCZMv1lNQsaZvRxYMYQiRb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npbnA0GCRiXwkhwZwIx9VmkxOHg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
