Bill's roots in hardcore punk and thrash metal, combined with years of putting passion to work, forged a signature sound that would ultimately become the backbone of the sludgy, psychadelic and progressive riffs that are Mastodon.  In this honest and unflinching feature-length documentary, Bill reveals all that he has sacrificed to achieve his dreams - and what he learned from fifteen years on the road. From the lowest of lows, to international success as one of today's biggest metal bands, it's all here.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ap3gUgqL5cj7new0ed01pLVhc2t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236916,"logo_path":null,"name":"FRET12","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Kelliher: The Sound and The Story","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Brueckmann","original_name":"Chuck Brueckmann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5e10da1066023ecd12ffb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4897486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Knigge","original_name":"Ed Knigge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c5e1576920e7475c25069e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iinRPmHZtVWKS2qykPgJcF3BMXY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j3AeRCAGXrkUXzRcMv9JaHHZUi6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z7RhyWxzX6o5tfi8kjDE6VARW5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ap3gUgqL5cj7new0ed01pLVhc2t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":619}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
