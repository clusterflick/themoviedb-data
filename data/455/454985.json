We shared classes and had friends in common but for some strange reason I never introduced myself. All during college, and then into the real world, through a decade of overlapping connections, we never met. This film is an examination of that hesitation and an attempt to understand why I never made the easiest connection in the world… until it was too late. Through archival footage and re-enactment of the era in question, IDAC is ultimately a documentary about what was happening on an unconscious level and how distant a relative can be even when they’re right in front of your face.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IDAC","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825803,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Casimir Nozkowski","original_name":"Casimir Nozkowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"592c7a9ec3a3680f77000736","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825803,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Casimir Nozkowski","original_name":"Casimir Nozkowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c7aae9251417c03000733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825803,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Casimir Nozkowski","original_name":"Casimir Nozkowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c7ac79251417c1b000711","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825805,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Strung","original_name":"Alexander Strung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c7ad79251417bf9000778","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tod Chapman","original_name":"Tod Chapman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c7aedc3a3680ffa00081e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8vgHJaO8HaIqAoLoHd3AD2oKyO2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
