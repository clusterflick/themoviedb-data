The film's protagonist, a singing red-haired beauty, Lada Rybka, had decided to fulfil at least three cherished wishes, written on a piece of paper. Everything in her life has gone well - concert tours, a TV recording and love. Lada gathers some ex-classmates for a women's reunion party before her marriage to Vadim. The young ladies talk about life, and Lada persuades teacher Asya, policewoman Masha and business lady Nina, that in life everything is possible - you simply have to know what you want. The friends write their desires on pieces of paper, and Lada promises them that they will come true -- for sure. Except that Fate has already made its own arrangements.","popularity":0.2431,"poster_path":"/wtAn9gG5rVesKswayhNewNqisQk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16079,"logo_path":"/6BF18oLINXIs1FZCZBAV1JOJx5h.png","name":"Star Media","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2007-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Year of the golden fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Grineva","original_name":"Ирина Гринёва","popularity":0.2532,"profile_path":"/2a86duQhAuKqBmpS25X8iJaHPPh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lada Rybka","credit_id":"5beeb2730e0a26265c017031","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleksii Vertynskyi","original_name":"Олексій Вертинський","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/xhlUbcJF6xnKieDB2dgEEFVRvjo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"pan Valdek","credit_id":"5beeb3be9251415cc1015254","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1190712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yelena Koreneva","original_name":"Елена Коренева","popularity":0.2737,"profile_path":"/RPHT9o5ZPWvMfgK4Wb6J1955Av.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Albina Mikhailovna, Asya's mother","credit_id":"5beeb4030e0a2626610161cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Panova","original_name":"Елена Панова","popularity":0.2414,"profile_path":"/i2NOsbmpjMyTkGOjIKSdUjQMVAm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Masha","credit_id":"5beeb4519251415ccc0152c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitri Ulyanov","original_name":"Дмитрий Ульянов","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/aeq0cpulQIiNEXpnK6fUuwSuPiE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vadim","credit_id":"5beeb4739251415cc8014bfa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":582577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniya Dmitrieva","original_name":"Евгения Дмитриева","popularity":0.2678,"profile_path":"/7FbcKCUmI0HPOWZTOPiWildTAPx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Asya","credit_id":"5beeb50a0e0a26265c017311","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2376839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Krasavin","original_name":"Andrei Krasavin","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6307e0cb3dd12600839d896e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikhail Alekseev","original_name":"Mikhail Alekseev","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beebb649251415cd101649b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176676,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sergey Ryabets","original_name":"Sergey Ryabets","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beeb92d9251415cd9015345","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6749816","wikidata_id":"Q16715053","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wtAn9gG5rVesKswayhNewNqisQk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
