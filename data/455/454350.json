It takes place in a suburb populated by children playing and indistinct parental figures. The narrative plot might suggest that it was a boy's night-time plays; The flashes of a torch in a dark room evoke fights and aerial bombardments. An impression of hostility and a feeling of horror interferes in all the movements ... The fantasy is tinged with nightmare, a storm of repressed emotions hides behind the calm facade of this house. In Nocturne, found footage blends so well with the threat that its perception produces a discharge from the unconscious.","popularity":0.4013,"poster_path":"/2R9TqpmMPRrOnnn6DXt88uxl6v7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturne","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Solomon","original_name":"Phil Solomon","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/s7nLZ9qIewo8LS6kUR5AzrQnfZm.jpg","credit_id":"5912509ec3a3686519045140","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0282027","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/21PbhjM875Ll9AyU52jg6MogJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oEEl1HGXqkVVYwNu6OQxM9fmymZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h69toHsEmevixubE1qff4ktcrJq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2R9TqpmMPRrOnnn6DXt88uxl6v7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":201171,"name":"lights"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":268054,"name":"night"},{"id":285138,"name":"nocturnal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
