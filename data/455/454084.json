At the same time, his wife with whom he has been married for more than 30 years and with whom he has six children, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Eduardo faces two crises, one of country and one in his home. Over time the disease completely takes his wife and Eduardo, who left his post in government to dedicate himself to his family, is in need to continue with his life. Submerged in the pain that causes the disease, not only the patient but the relatives and those closest to him, Eduardo begins a new love relationship that gives him back the desire to live.","popularity":0.2898,"poster_path":"/7f03WUqpk0ECGkgiXwtlqcNSoJQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Macaná","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2018-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¿Quién eres tú?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1100145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Félix Gómez","original_name":"José Félix Gómez","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eduardo Suárez","credit_id":"638808b7d388ae00794377eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Hernández","original_name":"Teresa Hernández","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aurora Suárez","credit_id":"638808d82e0697024d2c3859","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1100142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kisha Tikina Burgos","original_name":"Kisha Tikina Burgos","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/ipDdRnLVnts7FrsZgbMaa7oXCR9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Belén","credit_id":"6388091d1b157d0085eda4dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":979307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Gonzaga","original_name":"Luis Gonzaga","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":"/7cYbrJQxe32kSnsEhrsNVRdO1kJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Juan Pérez","credit_id":"63880930a410c800c8875c28","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Betancourt","original_name":"Nicole Betancourt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"6388094f2e0697024d2c38a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cordelia González","original_name":"Cordelia González","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/aYHaWKZv40VIBX0v2bGfzOusftv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Helena de León","credit_id":"6388097ea410c800c8875c7e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisé Álvarez","original_name":"Marisé Álvarez","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/gbxqOVq81DVyZRLtkQ98XbWDE7a.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"638809a8d388ae00af4d5a87","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Navarro","original_name":"Jimmy Navarro","popularity":0.2341,"profile_path":"/q2t6elIvbwEgxd5eLkQ1Dc5zIfv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Governor","credit_id":"638809e8fb83460099623863","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613839,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Santiago 'Chago' Benet","original_name":"Santiago 'Chago' Benet","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/ngr4Chjs7JuShBprSeTm5tOsXb6.jpg","credit_id":"63880a5d0398ab00c839d4d0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648940,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eduardo Cabra","original_name":"Eduardo Cabra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5rncatEbbHDovSMwEnNnJqy1FME.jpg","credit_id":"63880a700398ab008405130d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arí Maniel Cruz","original_name":"Arí Maniel Cruz","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":"/xVPl2FnEroTnAz96hpTI01wwFMv.jpg","credit_id":"58fe0821925141642f031d78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611753,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ybelka Hurtado","original_name":"Ybelka Hurtado","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792758a0ec6546aaaa03686","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Department Head"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":892,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/15Cr9aTBPS32B5p7jQtd3zFNGX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1585},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":892,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKLZqBaLdoUrEYQdIkYoVzxTnqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1585}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7f03WUqpk0ECGkgiXwtlqcNSoJQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
