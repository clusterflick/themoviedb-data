Despite his decline, Phettberg has remained a charismatic, unique \"pyre\" (as he calls himself) who documents his slowly fading life daily on the Internet and in his weekly column in the Viennese city magazine \"Falter\" and struggles to survive as Austria's best-known welfare recipient. Sobo Swobodnik shows this daily struggle of a one-time star who became a patronized outsider - with three strokes, a heart attack, extreme bladder weakness and an irrepressible will to go on living.","popularity":0.242,"poster_path":"/toRxDd1b9eS8x6PiQwjzbMnasdV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Athlon Produktion Wien","origin_country":""},{"id":121084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guerilla Film Koop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Papst ist kein Jeansboy","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermes Phettberg","original_name":"Hermes Phettberg","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67649966879bf51cc0ebc335","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Hader","original_name":"Josef Hader","popularity":0.2201,"profile_path":"/swwsXdnrX7GsGI4Wlqvtp10ONIH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sprecher","credit_id":"67649970c6e919e613b08ab8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185643,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kurt Palm","original_name":"Kurt Palm","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67649a9cb6443875a2822656","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Katlein","original_name":"Peter Katlein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67649aad36969d39dc82245a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roman Berka","original_name":"Roman Berka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67649ac2b6443875a2822663","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Schweiger","original_name":"Renate Schweiger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67649ad4879bf51cc0ebc375","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Veratschnig","original_name":"Vladimir Veratschnig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67649af5b6443875a2822676","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilhelm Aschauer","original_name":"Wilhelm Aschauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67649b08c6e919e613b08b9d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sobo Swobodnik","original_name":"Sobo Swobodnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5901c7eac3a368111200a666","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sobo Swobodnik","original_name":"Sobo Swobodnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67649b32c6e919e613b08bb7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sobo Swobodnik","original_name":"Sobo Swobodnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67649b4836969d39dc822486","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154538,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefanie Kosik","original_name":"Stefanie Kosik","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67649b72c6e919e613b08be3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2108464,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Helen Neikes","original_name":"Helen Neikes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67649b93b6443875a282269e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895296,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olaf Simon","original_name":"Olaf Simon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67649bb4c6e919e613b08bfc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892973,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malte Eiben","original_name":"Malte Eiben","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67649bd5b04befc1deebc18e","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5130141,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick G.
