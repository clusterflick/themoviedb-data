Well-researched and expertly constructed, Barry Avrich’s eye-opening documentary peels back the layers of the art world economy- from production to circulation, and delineates every integral player in the game of art-making, including curators, gallerists, collectors, donors, auction houses, and … artists. In the process, he unpacks the complex and surprising ecosystem that supports the art world superstars and million-dollar deals that make front-page news. Featuring extraordinary access to industry players and candid statements from prominent artists like Damien Hirst, Julian Schnabel, Taryn Simon, and Marina Abramovic, Blurred Lines collides the two narratives of the art world as both above and beholden to market forces.","popularity":0.2587,"poster_path":"/91ESE0jyUdq4aABfr4z1lXqSzxz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blurred Lines: Inside the Art World","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1999657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rashid Johnson","original_name":"Rashid Johnson","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/b0XmvXqhLR7huib93uIwSC91Zw1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c4bc764c3a368049c82c61f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1060565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Abramović","original_name":"Marina Abramović","popularity":0.2952,"profile_path":"/acyUmjRy0bLQgHk8Utpg88oCwAl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Artist","credit_id":"60a8fe480398ab00578d8c92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Arnold","original_name":"Katherine Arnold","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Director of Post-War and Contemporary Art, Christie's","credit_id":"60a8fe608dbc3300282bcab0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Black","original_name":"Leon Black","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Collector (archive footage)","credit_id":"60a8feba7f4f21002a8fe7ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Cappellazzo","original_name":"Amy Cappellazzo","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Chairman, Executive Vice President, Sotheby's","credit_id":"60a8fed785702e006eef99ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2059781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon de Pury","original_name":"Simon de Pury","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Auctioneer","credit_id":"60a8ff09c6006d002a72f0b6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Dennison","original_name":"Lisa Dennison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Chairman, North and South America, Sotheby's","credit_id":"60a8ff2cd8cc4a0057424244","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Paul Engelen","original_name":"Jean Paul Engelen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Worldwide Head of Contemporary Art, Phillips","credit_id":"60a8ff3c85702e002918cbf9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Koons","original_name":"Jeff Koons","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/omhHKQPGdsnZ1clyX4k1x3gfu38.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Artist (archive footage)","credit_id":"60a8ff500398ab00578d8d3c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":666935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Avrich","original_name":"Barry Avrich","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/lmTmLUr0yqTzcaxVvxuxPNWOEwu.jpg","credit_id":"5a5915c19251415910001073","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5602204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3SsUCC7r1KEuDu3DRBqu0fLNkTZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":964,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j48FY4fbDeaFL8IZysCGP4oIMgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1712}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/91ESE0jyUdq4aABfr4z1lXqSzxz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dSSqy5tH8da59miwf0JHcztkBE0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/xD3N8I4T3FnEFkkORr9BySejrMH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
