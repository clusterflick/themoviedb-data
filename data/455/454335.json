The idea of the trip came from intense contact with theatre professionals in Palestine, and most especially with the Freedom Theatre in the refugee camp in Jenin. Under the watchful eye of the film director Nicolas Klotz, the tragedy of the Danish prince intersects with that of young Palestinians. The film is, moreover, a view on another tragedy: the murder of Juliano Mer Khamis, the former director of Freedom Theatre, killed by an unknown assassin in April 2011.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/cj0H5hXLg0GfcKfSKdp5Y00TPDr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamlet in Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Ostermeier","original_name":"Thomas Ostermeier","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/oa2JzlOPsGqk6T0CbF3jmawsNb5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58ff1bc992514107d00070ff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Klotz","original_name":"Nicolas Klotz","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ff1bd7c3a3685352006096","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cj0H5hXLg0GfcKfSKdp5Y00TPDr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
