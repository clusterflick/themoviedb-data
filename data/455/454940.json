As Jane members describe finding feminism and clients describe finding Jane, archival footage and recreations mingle to depict how the repression of the early sixties and social movements of the late sixties influenced this unique group. Both vital knowledge and meditation on the process of empowerment, Jane: An Abortion Service showcases the importance of preserving women's knowledge in the face of revisionist history.  JANE: AN ABORTION SERVICE was funded by the Independent Television Service (ITVS) with funds provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.","popularity":0.5304,"poster_path":"/wTU0sKp9J7BsTlwDit4iS48kJcI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jane: An Abortion Service","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nell Lundy","original_name":"Nell Lundy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5903ac15c3a3684af00004fc","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031941,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Kirtz","original_name":"Kate Kirtz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5903abfe9251416a1400058c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTU0sKp9J7BsTlwDit4iS48kJcI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":191037,"name":"women's health"},{"id":205968,"name":"reproductive health"},{"id":208591,"name":"abortion"},{"id":228649,"name":"reproductive rights"},{"id":234119,"name":"women's liberation"},{"id":234958,"name":"pro choice"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
