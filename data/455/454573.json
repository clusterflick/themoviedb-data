Unlike its predecessor, which was a period drama in style, this film is more contemporary, incorporating issues such as corruption at a general contractor. The dynamism of the farmers' revolt, with its mass mobilization of extras, is also a highlight of the film.","popularity":0.6299,"poster_path":"/3yNpo0bI4NQb5CvkablT6Dfjorg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Widow: Bliss in a Mourning Dress","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"現代群盗伝","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuhiro Sano","original_name":"佐野和宏","popularity":0.4643,"profile_path":"/sHpKVg3MDxiCMlMGbPSvpwGxwaL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd1f92514161b100dca8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Ishihara","original_name":"Yuri Ishihara","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd45c3a368104100c60e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hotaru Hazuki","original_name":"葉月螢","popularity":0.4926,"profile_path":"/iHPYR3B0SgES1Oz8Qmunykjv6Po.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd5092514161dd00df97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takahiko Kobayashi","original_name":"Takahiko Kobayashi","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd5792514161c600dd36","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeshi Itō","original_name":"伊藤猛","popularity":0.3954,"profile_path":"/2CLeWUSeKezsm2wW2mWziNHU8eV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd5cc3a368103600d32f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeshi Iguchi","original_name":"Takeshi Iguchi","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/sKA88QAcjZGdAWE3wtZGMg80gRQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd6392514161a600e5a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bunmei Tobayama","original_name":"外波山文明","popularity":0.2005,"profile_path":"/mlpxn158IglylFQoXtyaOuSkNbG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5900cd6992514161c600dd44","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahisa Zeze","original_name":"瀬々敬久","popularity":0.5098,"profile_path":"/mhUKffbVUEh706d3rkY4OnMnoxh.jpg","credit_id":"63c3154b23be4600817d3979","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahisa Zeze","original_name":"瀬々敬久","popularity":0.5098,"profile_path":"/mhUKffbVUEh706d3rkY4OnMnoxh.jpg","credit_id":"5900cd0ec3a3680fcc00df8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106995","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yNpo0bI4NQb5CvkablT6Dfjorg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":915}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
