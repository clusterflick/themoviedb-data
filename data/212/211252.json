A beautiful girl appears in his life to help guide him, but he can only see her through mysterious visions that nearly drive him mad. His obsession only makes him more reclusive, turning away his art dealer and the women in his life. Who is this girl? Is she for real? Or is she just a figment of his imagination? He will do anything to find out, even if it costs him everything.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Not Here (And She's Not There)","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Arrigo","original_name":"Vincent Arrigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sgt.
