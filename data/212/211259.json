There has been a long-standing misconception that the film \"Gnir Rednow\" is simply \"The Wonder Ring\" mirrored or projected in reverse. However, Mark Toscano of the Academy Film Archive has definitively established that the original roll of each one of these two films is \"unmistakably, completely comprised of camera original Kodachrome,\" and that no two shots are precisely the same from one film to the other.","popularity":0.0617,"poster_path":"/tYDvFbHdKRyZfNa9UbhdcQmvqDP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gnir Rednow","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Cornell","original_name":"Joseph Cornell","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/3JxMVOtAbN01e1ACnbGYLGPM0PL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d91c3a368484e1f05c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3739450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tYDvFbHdKRyZfNa9UbhdcQmvqDP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJv4gx3t8K2DrvNraj8rJo65ul4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
