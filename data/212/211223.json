Joining scientist Benton Quest, his plucky son Jonny, bodyguard Race Bannon and Jonny's young pal Hadji are Benton's biologist wife Rachel, Race's ex-wife Jade and young 12-year-old Jessie, who harbors a big secret. Throughout, Team Quest battles the evil schemes of modern-day alchemist Dr. Zin, who has cloned himself and created an army of mutant reptiles in the Peruvian rain forest. The clash there results in a tragedy that changes Jonny's life forever - and later leads to a worldwide pursuit of Zin that includes examining rare Leonardo da Vinci documents in Paris, exploring the Roman catacombs and a final confrontation in the Australian outback.","popularity":3.0324,"poster_path":"/sXrSqhLKo25eyMHka6JKe3YO9Ss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jonny's Golden Quest","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Estes","original_name":"Will Estes","popularity":0.8335,"profile_path":"/ddxb9Me3pNLpBUYZQ7stpCrIxFs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jonny Quest","credit_id":"52fe4d90c3a368484e1f01e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Gilbert","original_name":"Ed Gilbert","popularity":0.5153,"profile_path":"/uuyoM4Bo3zzmsDoOPzr5JeJaMdE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Commander","credit_id":"52fe4d90c3a368484e1f01e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meredith MacRae","original_name":"Meredith MacRae","popularity":0.2352,"profile_path":"/hEL6tnDQzgo1pZFHp7WUm6Mr6C2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Rachel Quest","credit_id":"52fe4d90c3a368484e1f01f3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hearn","original_name":"George Hearn","popularity":0.2179,"profile_path":"/nplvTkPLNrIpA56iO1vMpnHX06P.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"President","credit_id":"52fe4d90c3a368484e1f01eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anndi McAfee","original_name":"Anndi McAfee","popularity":0.689,"profile_path":"/31BmotCrcdSR6gFnJqqCUHvy6Dh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jessie Kenyon (Bannon)","credit_id":"52fe4d90c3a368484e1f01f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Messick","original_name":"Don Messick","popularity":0.5392,"profile_path":"/iT3okvWCKy6RAdo6dbx09RP0I3p.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Benton C.
