The voice of the photographer, speaking of his choices and memories, and a montage of sound archives seem to comment on the photographs, which several film archives put into context. A sober and fascinating presentation of the work of a great artist.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":149663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agence Rapho","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert Doisneau, tout simplement","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3302884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Doisneau","original_name":"Robert Doisneau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kg2hws3Lk31SI9Oj0qeBBI7bPjH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (voice) (archive footage)","credit_id":"63b20cd15ad76b00e6f95a38","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Jeudy","original_name":"Patrick Jeudy","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f24d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1718998,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Tubaut","original_name":"Françoise Tubaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603184ec11386c003c92d330","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0485758","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":981,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7QUdxKSuRvzgFSiM3xeSq7iCOWA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1746}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
