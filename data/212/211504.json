The film centers around a boy named Theo, who is burdened with a family aviation heirloom that he fears he can never live up to. In an attempt to overcome his struggle, he climbs to the top of the aviation mountain, dressed in the family flight suit, with the hat of his great-grandfather in his hand. In his failure to muster up the courage to take his first leap, he is plagued with an even more difficult task, when a fan boy of his follows him up the cliff and is suddenly blown off the edge.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Olivier","original_name":"Alexandra Olivier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kit (Voice)","credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1841","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Zacok","original_name":"Craig Zacok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1845","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195546,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ryan Elk","original_name":"Ryan Elk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f182b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195545,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ehren Burkhart","original_name":"Ehren Burkhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1825","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195544,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lauren Brown","original_name":"Lauren Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f181f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195548,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Drew Soman","original_name":"Drew Soman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1837","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195542,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Desalvo","original_name":"Peter Desalvo","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1813","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195547,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Doug Horak","original_name":"Doug Horak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1831","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195549,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nate Swinehart","original_name":"Nate Swinehart","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f183d","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195543,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Previty","original_name":"Alex Previty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f1819","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Floeck","original_name":"Adam Floeck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d96c3a368484e1f180d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2216962","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
