Saul Levine’s images are diffused, faded, and ephemeral, made all the more dissociating by Levine’s disorienting rapid cut editing, restless and twitching camerawork, and destabilized, quick pan sequences – an evocation of a transitory and wide-eyed innocence. —filmref.com","popularity":0.0568,"poster_path":"/y7m2zwsUVvztbA8PAlKNRVFG5sD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Note to Pati","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saul Levine","original_name":"Saul Levine","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lfLF8BWO3fkpx2P0971gGT156x2.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d90c3a368484e1f00df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1710435","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y7m2zwsUVvztbA8PAlKNRVFG5sD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAYiEPhxkgezjMRhbXTALZRONFt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
