While making her film, Woolcock realised that the very real problems of homeless people have very little to do with the lack of a roof over their heads or a bed to sleep in. Their problems come from their past lives - and are less easy to remedy. Despite the efforts of different charities to move people into homes, the streets are often where they feel safe and what they know best.  In this moving documentary, Woolcock gives the seen-but-unheard residents of London's streets a voice.","popularity":0.2159,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Streets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Penny Woolcock","original_name":"Penny Woolcock","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":"/fphFdTp1D2J0uGnI3FronRaKyMV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d8fc3a368484e1efeed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Penny Woolcock","original_name":"Penny Woolcock","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":"/fphFdTp1D2J0uGnI3FronRaKyMV.jpg","credit_id":"644ab19eb7abb504ead945ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3683801,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Fry","original_name":"Alex Fry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ab190b7abb50495d94672","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988464,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marina Parker","original_name":"Marina Parker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ab197b7abb50495d94676","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1851034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
