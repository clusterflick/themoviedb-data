Wreath, a 24 year old mama's boy, is forced to leave his house to find a job by his mother. In this effort to find employment, he accidentally hits the first trace of zombie in the apocalypse, a zombified girl by the name of Sarah . Wreath takes care of the zombie in secret whilst feeding it and eventually falling in love with it in his garage. In a different light, a trio consisting of a girl named Stella and her two contesting love interests, Josh and Brendan find themselves trapped in a provincial park amidst the zombie invasion, struggling for survival. And last but not least, two stoners, Carl and Reggie venture on a vacation up a mountain to escape the looming apocalypse only to find themselves on the trail of a strangely agile zombie clown who will stop at nothing to devour the brains of them both.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-10","revenue":1200,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They'll tear you a new one.","title":"Roaming Hungry","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Knauff","original_name":"Willie Knauff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2407","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Mountenay","original_name":"Sam Mountenay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Brendan","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f240b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosi Hunter","original_name":"Rosi Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Stella","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f240f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Legault","original_name":"Scott Legault","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Reggie","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2413","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexa Houle","original_name":"Alexa Houle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Clown Zombie","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2417","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoë Hadeler Lund","original_name":"Zoë Hadeler Lund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f241b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Brogan","original_name":"Kyle Brogan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Wreath","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f241f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connor Desharnais","original_name":"Connor Desharnais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Carl","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2423","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassidy Clayton","original_name":"Cassidy Clayton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Wreath's Mother","credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2427","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Figueroa","original_name":"Julian Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f242d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Figueroa","original_name":"Julian Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2433","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Figueroa","original_name":"Julian Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2439","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Figueroa","original_name":"Julian Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f243f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Figueroa","original_name":"Julian Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f2445","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Figueroa","original_name":"Julian Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9ac3a368484e1f244b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Roaming Hungry - Theatrical Trailer [HD]","key":"uR5Ffs2ZIkc","published_at":"2013-04-16T17:03:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec716c3a368544800aeb6"}]}}}
