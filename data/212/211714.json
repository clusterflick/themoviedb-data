It is about a forgotten city, a forgotten history and a forgotten people. With irony as their loved weapon for survival, they have to forget as well, in order not to give way to cynicism, hatred and grief. It is about remembering the old days when life - despite class differences, corruption and violence - was still good: waiters, bartenders and shopkeepers who are fighting a losing battle and have lost everything. It is also about the children who manage to survive by mastering the art of street life and who reveal the country in it's true colours. Just like the dogs they share the streets with, they have no good memories to forget.","popularity":0.2173,"poster_path":"/bm3Q7shwPLlOHVdPo0kgBOzo1ib.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carmen Cobos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2008-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oblivion","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"El Olvido - Das Vergessen","type":"TV Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"El Olvido - Vergetelheid","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d9bc3a368484e1f290f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sonia Goldenberg","original_name":"Sonia Goldenberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d9bc3a368484e1f2915","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d9bc3a368484e1f291b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1444306","wikidata_id":"Q110879430","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w7FyYdqtB3u2q8BggJ545Psc9Th.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/60F53CsJhLxK4dcpMbZaYOT7A69.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bm3Q7shwPLlOHVdPo0kgBOzo1ib.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":417,"name":"corruption"},{"id":5967,"name":"peru"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":204133,"name":"lima"},{"id":204134,"name":"human interest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El Olvido Trailer","key":"qgOkjuek7yY","published_at":"2008-10-22T15:26:45.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"539182180e0a260fb9001583"}]}}}
