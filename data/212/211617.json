It intimately focuses on a twenty-four-hour period in the life of a mysterious and lascivious pickpocket who has come to Toronto to win back the love of his life -an escort named Charlotte. Problem is he isn't nearly as gifted a con-artist as he believes he is and the love of his life doesn't react kindly to his forced reunion.","popularity":0.1157,"poster_path":"/ac9PU9aXgd8T8e65USOmVxxj7FC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15960,"logo_path":null,"name":"Borderline Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beware Pickpocket","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Amito","original_name":"David Amito","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":"/aSKSs4bVarGrtLDFApCv0WUezQi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pickpocket","credit_id":"52fe4d99c3a368484e1f2023","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Lagerlöf","original_name":"Elisabeth Lagerlöf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"52fe4d99c3a368484e1f2027","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Amito","original_name":"David Amito","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":"/aSKSs4bVarGrtLDFApCv0WUezQi.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d99c3a368484e1f201f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Laicini","original_name":"Michael Laicini","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d99c3a368484e1f2019","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1650494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ac9PU9aXgd8T8e65USOmVxxj7FC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
