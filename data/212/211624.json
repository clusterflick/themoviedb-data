Kenya erupted in ethnic violence after the 2007 Presidential election, and the two friends fell apart when, suddenly, it was 'not the brother time.' Filmed in the Rift Valley during the clashes, the roots of tribalism are explored as one who saw the worst of the conflict returns home to see his neighbor. To be released during the 2012 Presidential campaign, this message of hope shows it can be Brother Time once again.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brother Time","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Mutai","original_name":"Thomas Mutai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d99c3a368484e1f20a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.
