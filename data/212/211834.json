He goes on to say that the Air Force can have constructive, as well as destructive usesâ€”several examples are shown of this, including the dropping of food and supplies to remote areas, using B-17s to get serum to Alaska and B-25s to deploy DDT, and using helicopters to rescue the wounded. These are all examples of the peaceful uses of the air power that had been created for war. Various new aircraft are also shown, such as an early jet, and a \"flying wing\".","popularity":0.2287,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Air power is peace power","title":"Special Delivery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q7574514","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2532,"name":"bomber"},{"id":193175,"name":"army air force"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
