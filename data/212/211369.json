Hay plays the Director General of the National Broadcasting Group (NBG) who hides away in his office unaware that the general feeling about his programming is that it is too high-brow and the public are not happy. However, when he discovers this he decides to take action and promotes Jimmy, his Head of the Complaints Department, to Programme Director. Jimmy decides that a series of variety spectaculars are what the public want and sets about hiring the acts. But obstacles are put in his way and he discovers that the NBG has its own cluster of wannabe variety stars.","popularity":0.57,"poster_path":"/hFfLkZHRUE6RamImlV1yL6FOtCR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":305,"logo_path":null,"name":"British International Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1934-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radio Parade of 1935","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Radio Follies","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Hay","original_name":"Will Hay","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/6dQ6oCFt4UeXVsOiOswFmWevgIg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"William Garland","credit_id":"52fe4d93c3a368484e1f0bd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Chandler","original_name":"Helen Chandler","popularity":0.1711,"profile_path":"/fJ5t9zizR6M5Tw3CnUFp7mhE6Dq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joan Garland","credit_id":"534aab44c3a3682df600193b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifford Mollison","original_name":"Clifford Mollison","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/l7ao3rkVROrUNRHSjtcFSZ0PHp8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jimmie Clare","credit_id":"534aabe3c3a3682e0700190c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davy Burnaby","original_name":"Davy Burnaby","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/kvptNfXi698pVbJN2ItcPYvAn5b.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sir Frederick Fotheringhay","credit_id":"534aac02c3a3682df600194d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":608601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Drayton","original_name":"Alfred Drayton","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/sZU7u2o4osLvOE2PA6PjekpBnXc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Carl Graham","credit_id":"534aac0cc3a3682ddf00182c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bennett","original_name":"Billy Bennett","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Commissionaire","credit_id":"534aac14c3a3682dd80018ce","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":454265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Morris","original_name":"Lily Morris","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Charlady","credit_id":"534aac1dc3a3682ded0018b5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie Wallace","original_name":"Nellie Wallace","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/cdjtfwVuT8Le34DspFiNqIwUJ5g.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Charlady","credit_id":"534aac27c3a3682ded0018b8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Joyce","original_name":"Teddy Joyce","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Orchestra Leader","credit_id":"534aac31c3a3682e07001914","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur B.
