Zaman (Sami Kaftan), and his wife, Najma (Shatha Salim), have built their happy life together in their house of reeds and, though childless, adopted a boy, Yacine (Hussein Imad), orphaned by the 1991 Gulf War. They have lived a quiet, contented existence until Najma falls ill. The local doctor tells them she needs surgery or some special medicine he does not have. And so Zaman sets off in his small boat and journeys up the Tigris to Baghdad in search of the precious cure. Thus begins the journey of salvation and discovery for \"Zaman, the Man of the Reeds.\"","popularity":0.1755,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94621,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Village","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":74570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gilgamesh Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2003-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The First Iraqi Film in Over 15 Years!","title":"Zaman - The Man from the Reeds","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Zaman, L'homme des Roseaux","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zaman - Der weite Weg nach Bagdad","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Zaman, mannen från vassen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Zaman, mannen fran vassen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaza Salem","original_name":"Shaza Salem","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/ndpaFAbUkqJbpQp2MCnGm42yxTG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Najma","credit_id":"52fe4d92c3a368484e1f08ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saadiya Al-Zaydi","original_name":"Saadiya Al-Zaydi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Om Abbas","credit_id":"52fe4d92c3a368484e1f08f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hussein Imad","original_name":"Hussein Imad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Yasin","credit_id":"52fe4d92c3a368484e1f08f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3943491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nizar Al-Samarayi","original_name":"Nizar Al-Samarayi","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/fAQaZR4nLuYMhzcvqJhlC0b8Aby.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65b44b6d1c635b0162124dfc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joëlle Alauzet","original_name":"Joëlle Alauzet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d92c3a368484e1f0901","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amer Alwan","original_name":"Amer Alwan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d92c3a368484e1f08e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amer Alwan","original_name":"Amer Alwan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d92c3a368484e1f0907","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0383724","wikidata_id":"Q64735215","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1842,"name":"village life"},{"id":5939,"name":"iraq"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
