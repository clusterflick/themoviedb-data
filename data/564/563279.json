The film unravels his memories using archival photographs and Shammout’s own paintings to tell the story of Palestinian experience and resistance.  By simply using a montage of visuals and sounds and avoiding narration, Shammout adopts a style that was used by early Soviet filmmakers who wished to communicate across language boundaries, creating a film that offered an non-verbal narrative of the Palestinian cause. The film was screened at a variety of festivals in the former Soviet Union and won a prize at the International Leipzig Documentary and Short Film Week for Cinema and Television in 1973. Recently restored and digitized.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/boxzdWpeV2acUPBhaJohYjQQnS6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palestine Liberation Organization","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glow of Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4796895,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abdulla Abu-Jubein","original_name":"Abdulla Abu-Jubein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ca08f741328b81bb9827f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2179725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismail Shammout","original_name":"Ismail Shammout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ca0da78d03e1325b9076b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4796896,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kheir Kawash","original_name":"Kheir Kawash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ca0a04cede2f2fb8cd8f9","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4796897,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ibrahim Bashir","original_name":"Ibrahim Bashir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ca0c921519fafcf34b0de","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2179725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismail Shammout","original_name":"Ismail Shammout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf490149251415cdd09c9f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32767241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mRRkgIGbbWNm5Byx5h6Z15FtA4c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1399},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xDmGf8rBvJM7SMFZYXLjDUArrFk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1414},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wDCMHcUO1pWNh3QxpNS4Ha22Ndx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1412},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hO3Wtp05dxt7JuoQrDZQsSWWooo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1415},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":793,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sOeEJ5d6W73zGeYRJqbu6dH2GRV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1410}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7baYLLdrCUUVDOj2cta522RHgw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/boxzdWpeV2acUPBhaJohYjQQnS6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Porto, Cineclube EA","release_date":"2024-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
