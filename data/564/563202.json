The editing image by image allows us to explain the connections that link each image, their contents and their symbols. Like a synthesis, through the prism of Totality, the film shows all these questions and researches about Man and his world.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/p1xV37NCIDj2UzC0rXo0FOtNrP0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TOTALITÉ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johanna Vaude","original_name":"Johanna Vaude","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf4555c0e0a26266f09ff62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p1xV37NCIDj2UzC0rXo0FOtNrP0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
