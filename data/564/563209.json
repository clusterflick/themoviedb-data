The sole reason for his unfamiliarity is the fact that he exclusively worked on amateur films.  The fate of amateur film in our country was never (and probably won't be in the future either) publically recognized with enough understanding, even though during the last 50 years it was the only example of authentic avant-garde in the field of film expression. Through Pansini's thoughts and film clips, this documentary is attempting to reconstruct, to some extent, this extraordinary author's amateur film making development.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bAA5GwoWl4UjDBcqKvypmJbRCvz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60850,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hrvatski Filmski Savez (HFS)","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mihovil Pansini - Ships Don't Come Ashore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihovil Pansini","original_name":"Mihovil Pansini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/19PCUy6HxWdrjLaGVmSSZeFHhY9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bf45b6c9251415cd109c159","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milan Bukovac","original_name":"Milan Bukovac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf45b609251415cd109c13a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milan Bukovac","original_name":"Milan Bukovac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e31fcc3a3687e4af1d3b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34747577","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bAA5GwoWl4UjDBcqKvypmJbRCvz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
