Rajasinghe the Second the King of the Kandyan Kingdom, is hemmed in by the Dutch who controlled the maritime provinces of the Sri Lankan. A rebel - Ambanwala Rala, threatens him within his own kingdom. Ambanwala Rala enjoys some support from influential Kandyan chiefs as well as those who wield considerable civil power in the villages.  The film revolves around the lives of this exorcist, his assistant, a woman called Kirimenike and her man Herath.  The story unfolds against the backdrop of this political turmoil, the rebellion and counter rebellion weaving in and out of the inter-play among these characters and the cultural ethos that surrounds them.  In the final denouement, the protagonists discover themselves and each other; partly as a result of the tumult they live through.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/htZHqlhVnOpxLTHNy66rot6rN6T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Agnidahaya","title":"Fire & Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0499181","wikidata_id":"Q30637359","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/htZHqlhVnOpxLTHNy66rot6rN6T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
