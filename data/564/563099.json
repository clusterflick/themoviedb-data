Patrick seems to be the epitome of the up-and-comer at any price: with no scruples whatsoever, he manages to break into the world of finance, i.e. into the home of banker Philippe Haguenauer. He soon becomes the lover of the woman, Hélène, director of a major fashion house, while Philippe, for his part, is having the perfect love affair with Nadine, his secretary. And this with the mutual consent of both spouses. Meanwhile, Michel, shy and sentimental, is looking for a situation, while remaining honest.","popularity":0.2465,"poster_path":"/e1mqfyqW1RWDxIlm6oBhv6xPtRJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Félix Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":84698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Française de Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"À nous deux, Paris!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Subor","original_name":"Michel Subor","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/il6f0zTI3YZx6pEe13x1vEQo5eX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Patrick Cartier","credit_id":"5e5d544c1108a800170a3064","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Despax","original_name":"Olivier Despax","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/A4AzgH3CAbZ3EGgB6oN0rVwOxZ5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michel Lamballe","credit_id":"5e5d546187e63e001774661a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aram Stephan","original_name":"Aram Stephan","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":"/aPWAcoN6jwNvPD1vOw6kp1v9Ho4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clairvaux","credit_id":"5e5d547355c9260013544602","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Duhamel","original_name":"Claire Duhamel","popularity":0.1515,"profile_path":"/y2GlFNBcvZcek9BidxUmxWSC77H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hélène Haguenauer","credit_id":"5e5d548666ae4d0012899ae0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yori Bertin","original_name":"Yori Bertin","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/z06RoAT4XJvHPbOmRkbeeuZcZQy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nadine","credit_id":"5e5d54bd55c92600195391d4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Dax","original_name":"Micheline Dax","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/5tenvBWqABF4lJSZdBxuDwapDbn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"5e5d54ce55c9260019539235","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Lambert","original_name":"Madeleine Lambert","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mme Hagueauner mère","credit_id":"5e5d54e487e63e0017746748","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Vierne","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Vierne","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf3b5e8c3a368189f0991fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antoine Blondin","original_name":"Antoine Blondin","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/8pYXU2orX0hqsXs08rz0mzA7qZU.jpg","credit_id":"5e5d551066ae4d0017898adc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555387,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Serge Rapoutet","original_name":"Serge Rapoutet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5d5554357c0000132c3a44","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Despax","original_name":"Olivier Despax","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/A4AzgH3CAbZ3EGgB6oN0rVwOxZ5.jpg","credit_id":"5e5d553587e63e00157429c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32316,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Guimard","original_name":"Paul Guimard","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/tDZ0Ripc6Z7bjv1fHvxXFGbc13m.jpg","credit_id":"5e5d5523357c0000112c5a24","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2021790,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janko Nilovic","original_name":"Janko Nilovic","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5d554466ae4d0017898afe","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191668","wikidata_id":"Q30742505","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jVeI4aUtyIuoID6rqSuoR6kBkjX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":661},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/e1mqfyqW1RWDxIlm6oBhv6xPtRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
