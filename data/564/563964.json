When she felt a man around she would start to sing gently to lure him. Once under the spell of the Iara, a man would leave his family to live with her underwater forever. Iara is a free interpretation of this old tale, but this time with a Sapphic twist.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/hSiE0UgrufUaWuEGnbEmW6uiUxT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erika Pereira dos Santos","original_name":"Erika Pereira dos Santos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"633bf6d04cbe12007c3a71ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3726269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Delfino","original_name":"Camila Delfino","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"633bf6d438469a007fb5798e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1909989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovana Cordeiro","original_name":"Giovana Cordeiro","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/d8O59dTapS14c8iWiKf9O4ifC1W.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"633bf6eb4cbe12007c3a71b9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cássio Pereira dos Santos","original_name":"Cássio Pereira dos Santos","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/5hAH8hl1TzMxGFdjPsJp5v6zEA0.jpg","credit_id":"633bf6f942f19f0081966822","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erika Pereira dos Santos","original_name":"Erika Pereira dos Santos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf822cac3a36838ab088c71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cássio Pereira dos Santos","original_name":"Cássio Pereira dos Santos","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/5hAH8hl1TzMxGFdjPsJp5v6zEA0.jpg","credit_id":"5bf822dc9251415cc10eaf1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hSiE0UgrufUaWuEGnbEmW6uiUxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
