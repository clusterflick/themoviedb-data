Neshat's video places a woman within a groove in the trunk of a large fig tree, symbolising its soul. They stand, alone, in a stone-walled garden set in a mountainous landscape. Men and women draw near and enter the enclosure, seeking refuge, as the Tooba-woman disappears into the Tooba-tree. The piece is ambiguous. Who has agency? Is it the crowd, who 'invade' the garden or the tree-woman who draws them towards her like a magnet? Tooba is dedicated to Iranian writer Shahrnush Parsipour, whose novel Women without Men concerns five women sojourning in a garden, one of whom is transformed into a tree.","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/c3s7JSuFGVw4w3EecakZKYh9cPf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tooba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirin Neshat","original_name":"Shirin Neshat","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/st1h4deZVh1HWBIdynagR445zdK.jpg","credit_id":"5bf464060e0a264f6e03b67b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2240,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Darius Khondji","original_name":"Darius Khondji","popularity":0.3695,"profile_path":"/4UEPDPLbcvpkY2xG6PZM9D149dA.jpg","credit_id":"5bf464439251415cd109d60d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0344481","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aNiEa9jZmCqpzxlxBq3HxOjtgJX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c3s7JSuFGVw4w3EecakZKYh9cPf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki International Film Festival","release_date":"2002-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
