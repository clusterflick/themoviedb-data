We see a girl deliver newspapers to a house from which a small child emerges followed by a nanny pushing a pram. They both walk along quiet streets to a local park - followed by a sinister man. The nanny rests on a bench while the child chases her ball to an isolated spot. A shadow looms over her. Her scream alerts the nanny who finds the man on the ground revealing the Emperor moth heâ€™s just caught.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
