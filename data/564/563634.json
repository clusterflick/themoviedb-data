From 1920 to 1929 the studio \"Albatros\" and Russian filmmakers will literally upset the French cinema by bringing a specificity of their own. The phenomenal success of the films of the studio \"Albatros\" will give a second life to the French cinema then in crisis by propelling it to the first world ranking in competition with Hollywood. At the head of this small studio born one evening in February 1920 in Montreuil were two Russian producers: Joseph Ermolaev and Alexandr Kamenka.","popularity":0.1459,"poster_path":"/sNMuiO9WQYB7NOZnNVPSbu6TwPI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albatros,
