Told in the manner of \"Heaven Can Wait\", this spectacular film traces the young couple's entry into the pearly gates where they are met by four other young people.\r The cantankerous St. Peter bars entry, for to enter Paradise, the true facts of their lives must be revealed. No detail omitted, no act regardless how bizarre is kept from the eyes of the viewer. So degenerate are some of these acts that many are banished to hell.\r But will and Mona are returned to Earth for a second chance. How they use this new opportunity provides a delightful and erotic ending to a most unusual film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lzdoP6kTfzvos81vWVFbvfHw6zR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judgement
