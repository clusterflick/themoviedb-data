Originating from the director's observation that women trade secrets with friends and strangers in public washrooms, this innovative and candid documentary takes us to high school bathrooms, seniors centres' powder roooms, Newfoundland dance halls, New York nightclubs, a sauna in Copenhagen, a Casablanca hamman and country-and-western bars in Texas. In each location, as women are filmed in verit√© sequences, they confess their joys, their frustrations and their pain about love, sex, relationships with men and friendships with each other.","popularity":0.2072,"poster_path":"/9vprkCJiZrNpa8alqC8xdaE0ZTy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Powder Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Allder","original_name":"Michael Allder","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf7ee6f9251415ccc0e3473","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Kennard","original_name":"Ann Kennard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf7ec95c3a36818a3100b5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0119928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.552,"height":908,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9vprkCJiZrNpa8alqC8xdaE0ZTy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":249237,"name":"interpersonal relationships"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cinefest Sudbury International Film Festival","release_date":"1996-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
