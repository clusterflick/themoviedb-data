Their reputation in the stories varies from comical to frightening, godlike or wise, bringers of light and bringers of death, though a “murder” of crows refers to a flock of crows, and not to anything murderous, at all. They may be all these things, but what we are learning is that they are especially smart.  New research has shown that they are among the most intelligent animals on the planet. They use tools as only elephants and chimpanzees do, and recognize 250 distinct calls. One particular talent they have been discovered to possess is the ability to recognize individual human faces and pick them out of a crowd up to two years later – a trick that might make even Hitchcock shiver with fright.","popularity":0.3285,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Murder of Crows","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La inteligencia del cuervo","type":"Spanish"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Young","original_name":"Nora Young","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/64pR3Bn9VuaNNDJCz0euoDvQXo7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5eb96dacbbe1dd0021864b35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":187799,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David New","original_name":"David New","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb96d8ebbe1dd002084519f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas de Pencier","original_name":"Nicholas de Pencier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/o2fS1PTDw21v0Efb8ehR88psRXN.jpg","credit_id":"5eb96d7c7d2bc1001cfcd991","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176335,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Bernstein","original_name":"Daniel Bernstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb96d5abbe1dd0020845166","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Fleming","original_name":"Susan Fleming","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb96d437d2bc1001d0049fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":220954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Remerowski","original_name":"Ted Remerowski","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2c505222df2e00373d1d39","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1713797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
