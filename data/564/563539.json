As a woman of color who was born in Suriname but grew up in the Netherlands, she knows how it feels to be treated as a minority. Her outspoken style in fighting for a world in which everyone has equal rights and opportunities sometimes provokes extreme reactions, and her attackers have posted sinister death-threat videos on YouTube. We follow her in the three months leading up to the local elections, in which she's running for the Amsterdam City Council. During TV debates, interviews and discussions with opponents, we see Simons standing up for her opinions with a fascinating force of argument. But when she’s on her therapist's couch or at home in front of her well-filled walk-in closet, she shows her vulnerable side.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/2YWoHS3D6Xdm5s0gmEcVfrjds5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61713,"logo_path":null,"name":"KVFilm Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sylvana, Demon or Diva","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvana Simons","original_name":"Sylvana Simons","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/jGTRsJzh9cLeoOZhTH9DPCoaBUD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bf5d4419251415cdd0b26b4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451192,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rogier Timmermans","original_name":"Rogier Timmermans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669e48263461f3486a98ce45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Velthuis","original_name":"Eric Velthuis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5d5bd9251415ccc0b5b7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingeborg Jansen","original_name":"Ingeborg Jansen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5b9f1c3a36818a30c9a7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1501753,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joost van Herwijnen","original_name":"Joost van Herwijnen","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5d6319251415cc10b64d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582953,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Victor Horstink","original_name":"Victor Horstink","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5d64a9251415cd10b9898","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Merle Bemelmans","original_name":"Merle Bemelmans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5d5edc3a3682545020aa3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033141,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diderik Evers","original_name":"Diderik Evers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5d6690e0a26265e0c69c9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180250,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Janssens","original_name":"Patrick janssens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5d5869251415ccc0b5b40","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9652098","wikidata_id":"Q116210246","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2YWoHS3D6Xdm5s0gmEcVfrjds5q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
