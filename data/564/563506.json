It is the disturbing wordless story of a woman and a man living in a strange setting where objects are endowed with life that they have chosen to tell us through this theater of shadow puppets in cut out figurines. Their characters will know a tragic fate since carried in the air by balloons, they will finally be devoured by a horrible dragon.","popularity":0.1628,"poster_path":"/5HAXVpRw8xFkZwmxBqtJoMUvSpN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Service de la Recherche de l'ORTF","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":24119,"logo_path":"/iNcPopycyTGDgWy6dDl5cnlfS3n.png","name":"Radio-Télévision Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tick Tack","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Laloux","original_name":"René Laloux","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/z8OB7OFbI1kQDQaE04PckDpPgj6.jpg","credit_id":"5bf5a0ab0e0a26265e0c0f8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Laloux","original_name":"René Laloux","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/z8OB7OFbI1kQDQaE04PckDpPgj6.jpg","credit_id":"5fb426b5e24e3a003dea05e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2091835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Brissot","original_name":"Jacques Brissot","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdd6a7d8c44b9003c9b5fd2","department":"Production","job":"Development Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Boucourechliev","original_name":"André Boucourechliev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdd6a933c887d0042aa5c8b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Laloux","original_name":"René Laloux","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/z8OB7OFbI1kQDQaE04PckDpPgj6.jpg","credit_id":"60233224abdec00040e04e69","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Oury","original_name":"Jean Oury","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60233c3ddd2589003db96d96","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064162,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Félix Guattari","original_name":"Félix Guattari","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60233c879d2b63003e65063d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2091835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Brissot","original_name":"Jacques Brissot","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602342109d2b630040645927","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ry7Bj8s4JNSHIfXvZcLJ9j0KIc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2dJVpctKwL1llg33Att3t8I8zXI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5HAXVpRw8xFkZwmxBqtJoMUvSpN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
