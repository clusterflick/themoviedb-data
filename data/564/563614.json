Despite Cantus' warnings, Gobo goes on a journey to find out if the mythical Great Bell at the heart of Fraggle Rock is real. When the Rock slows down in the winter, the Fraggles hold the Festival of the Bells to make sure it keeps moving. As part of the celebration, they ring bells to awaken the Great Bell at the heart of the Rock. They also dress up as a Weebabeast, who used to guard the Great Bell when the Rock was small.  Meanwhile, Doc and Sprocket explore mid-winter holiday traditions from around the world.","popularity":1.0461,"poster_path":"/68vvqwPuWJKDNoAEAmLyMJxMFmn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bells of Fraggle Rock","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Whitmire","original_name":"Steve Whitmire","popularity":0.5253,"profile_path":"/q1EVmCM1lKjI5OJOCmnvmYPWztp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Wembley Fraggle / Sprocket the Dog (voice)","credit_id":"5bf61ca19251417c1d054068","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Goelz","original_name":"Dave Goelz","popularity":0.4597,"profile_path":"/tBJDwH008IVSeTCB5e2P856NbIv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Boober Fraggle / Uncle Travelling Matt (voice)","credit_id":"5bf61cbc0e0a2639d605a3b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Mullen","original_name":"Kathryn Mullen","popularity":0.3165,"profile_path":"/dlPfM4nIGMWm7jS5vClmMfoeKqA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mokey Fraggle (voice)","credit_id":"5bf61ced0e0a264f6e05f0ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Parkes","original_name":"Gerard Parkes","popularity":0.1781,"profile_path":"/miMUDVlmXTp5f3opfW4UarEaF9I.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doc","credit_id":"5bf61d1bc3a36818a30d3066","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Nelson","original_name":"Jerry Nelson","popularity":0.2763,"profile_path":"/daCTg4kX7AjrWj54qmRH2Po3znW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gobo Fraggle (voice)","credit_id":"5bf61d3dc3a36818ae0bd87f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Henson","original_name":"Jim Henson","popularity":0.4689,"profile_path":"/93vzGW2kWwmAJ8HpbErzKMHXDME.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cantus the Minstrel (voice)","credit_id":"5bf61d59c3a36818ae0bd89a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":189120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Prell","original_name":"Karen Prell","popularity":0.1717,"profile_path":"/jkM0VMUzmFnhiJexioqxSDzEcbk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Red Fraggle (voice)","credit_id":"64b2ff7f0bb07600eb28d475","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Williams","original_name":"Douglas Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b2fd99378062013906972d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Henson","original_name":"Jim Henson","popularity":0.4689,"profile_path":"/93vzGW2kWwmAJ8HpbErzKMHXDME.jpg","credit_id":"5bf61dd5c3a36818a50c2d18","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jerry Juhl","original_name":"Jerry Juhl","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/w2CqQZ4NORuJ9aXs1qqMD4a5ShN.jpg","credit_id":"5bf61de40e0a26265e0cd2c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1124632","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7N2g36gM0X9tuAUF9ck6nz3fh5J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/68vvqwPuWJKDNoAEAmLyMJxMFmn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8GYqiTa9wXKxWd4xGnMNXz1YoBU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":65,"name":"holiday"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Bells of Fraggle Rock - Fraggle Rock - The Jim Henson Company","key":"GtFYCeLgcwo","published_at":"2010-12-15T19:03:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"5bf61c3b0e0a2639d605a306"}]}}}
