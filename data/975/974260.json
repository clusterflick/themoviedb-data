It is the first time that Zappa has allowed a film crew to study him during compositional work, actually filming the first moments of a new compositional process. By contrast, in a staged interview Zappa gives comments on music. This film seeks to reveal the sensetivities of Zappa's personality and character also beyond narrative content.","popularity":1.0816,"poster_path":"/cktug7GeDkBKVL2pt6B66SX1vce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
