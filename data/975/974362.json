Hitoshi Kamibayashi, who rushed to the scene, was hit by a fierce shooting by a man in a black leather coat. It was Jin who responded, but he let the man escape. The sand group was struck by the anomaly of shooting 30 bullets at one woman. At that time, the young head of the Kyushu Genryukai is killed. Sakai, the chairman of the Kanto Ichienkai, orders the extermination of Sakoda, a former Genryukai executive who attacked Hitoshi and Yoshiro. And that Sakoda was undoubtedly the man in that black leather coat.","popularity":0.339,"poster_path":"/8JCWg1VAuqjQUfZXsIVKdSLrS5I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jingi 17: The Beast of Killing All","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riki Takeuchi","original_name":"竹内力","popularity":0.8145,"profile_path":"/qkCuwootNhUjRrGpl9V4UmUkyRL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"627b14ac5ff34e006788d1b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshihiko Sakakibara","original_name":"榊原利彦","popularity":0.2144,"profile_path":"/s5IucNos41A3iEloXv9faALIu69.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"627b14b4764b990066a8dcb9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rei Natsume","original_name":"夏目玲","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"627b14be2385130050d38111","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koichi Ueda","original_name":"上田耕一","popularity":0.6126,"profile_path":"/9rso4VVej1wejJyNQ6QgDBwGlr6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"627b14c7eec4f300660397b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaori Ohara","original_name":"Kaori Ohara","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"627b14cf4b9bae00675d93fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢仁志","popularity":0.8392,"profile_path":"/m2mLrkCcttT2fgHBMfObbq6G0sw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"627b14dac2f44b017370b3ba","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88899,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toshimichi Ohkawa","original_name":"大川俊道","popularity":0.2037,"profile_path":"/t1oZqWaPJT4ur6yBJqv31GatJcz.jpg","credit_id":"627b149e9b6e4700661b4794","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2574335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noboru Matsui","original_name":"松井昇","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b148e1c6329009cdf98c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8JCWg1VAuqjQUfZXsIVKdSLrS5I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
