During this process they discovered that many of the workers were homosexual partners (who were featured in the documentary Lesbian Factory). 6-7 years have passed since then, what happened to those star crossed lovers in their pursuit for a way of life, have they found what they were looking for? The TIWA film crew set out to continue following their footsteps across the world. Documenting their love stories, battling gender identity and crossing social boundaries with their changing lives.
