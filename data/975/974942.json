She started skating at the age of 5. Propelled in Paris to try her luck, the teenager meets this famous coach. \"He scared everyone\", she will admit. He is a great man who has a hold on her. During the stretching, the behavior of this man is unhealthy. But it is at the age of 15 that everything collapses.
