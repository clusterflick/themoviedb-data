In little over a hundred years the natural landscape has been transformed into the industrial hellscape of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. As incumbent Mayor John Bowler starts to campaign for a second term, independent prospector John ‘General Hercules’ Katahanas decides to run against him on an anti-corruption ticket. What starts out as a quirky David-vs-Goliath political battle, unravels into a portrait of a man, a town and a country sent mad by the timeless cycles of exploitation, racism and greed.","popularity":0.266,"poster_path":"/ylpOHU2dKjFRrNEdNrdBJTw34at.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toy Shop Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"General Hercules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brodie Poole","original_name":"Brodie Poole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8dba323eba00686dc1f7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544974,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Pavlovic","original_name":"Nina Pavlovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8ee6f5c8240052599176","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brodie Poole","original_name":"Brodie Poole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8d7d323eba009e5c8d2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544972,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annika Damon","original_name":"Annika Damon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8eba6636270ce652a671","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ruby Schmidt","original_name":"Ruby Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8da6764b990b8991940b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brodie Poole","original_name":"Brodie Poole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8e85e18b97006559643d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaydon Martin","original_name":"Jaydon Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8e939f37b0005111877b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brodie Poole","original_name":"Brodie Poole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8ef16636270ce528c8a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544970,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joe McLaren","original_name":"Joe McLaren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8ea66636270ce652a648","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":506356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Bate","original_name":"Matthew Bate","popularity":0.3045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627b8e71f5c82400525990b0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21002066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u2uPrvQA0AMz8vx2BkzVZL5vDGs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dVWr65gFstuhNol2fI0FHTik14H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ARcldt7KbZyrsqD8Zb9kolDwB2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ylpOHU2dKjFRrNEdNrdBJTw34at.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":5332,"name":"greed"},{"id":2804,"name":"exploitation"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":272385,"name":"mayoral election"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"General Hercules – Trailer – SFF 22","key":"aoP9Hj5iKjw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-10T23:27:08.000Z","id":"627b8d2a9f37b0009f9b8f98"}]}}}
