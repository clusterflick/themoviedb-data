The narrator then discusses the origin of the idea depicted in \"Soylent Green.\" Director Richard Fleischer and star Charlton Heston discuss how an upcoming crowd scene will be filmed. Then we see what happens when the crowd riots because there is not enough food available to be distributed to everyone. \"Soylent Green\" was Edward G. Robinson's 101st (and, as it turned out, his last) feature film. During a break in filming, the cast and crew hold a ceremony celebrating the first film of his \"second hundred,\" and Robinson makes appreciative remarks to the crowd. Studio head Jack L. Warner and friend George Burns are among those in attendance.","popularity":1.14,"poster_path":"/1LElXdqslkj0gY42NHiKyKOfsQn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113519,"logo_path":"/wxcVGtJwKkElcCXP6A0opM82xu0.png","name":"Warner Home Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Look at the World of 'Soylent Green'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Fleischer","original_name":"Richard Fleischer","popularity":0.2358,"profile_path":"/vAPv1aa28u12zcq8YMvuwZu1hhC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627c6934fdc4fa00ab71db65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlton Heston","original_name":"Charlton Heston","popularity":2.5953,"profile_path":"/mJabHWZrjlFiF8U8Bbr8lSFtLX6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627c693efdc4fa006823b7ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Taylor-Young","original_name":"Leigh Taylor-Young","popularity":0.4079,"profile_path":"/9l8TSUQQsTGx8aQMGurIf9gdTPY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627c69495aadc400652b21e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brock Peters","original_name":"Brock Peters","popularity":0.7439,"profile_path":"/yrnjKF4BDdp7usDJeHGpMmYUNgJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627c6953f6596f0065f4b4f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward G.
