Just after a week of moving into her new home, Sophie's sense of reality takes on a distorted form as she begins to believe her house is living and breathing around her. Perhaps a result of her isolation? The side effect of a fertility treatment? Or even an outside antagonist? Appliance makes light of the disturbing history shaping the American delusion that homeownership is both an accessible tool for social mobility and a means by which one can value their self-worth.","popularity":0.2583,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appliance","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1486488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Callie Hernandez","original_name":"Callie Hernandez","popularity":0.5187,"profile_path":"/doMXlhTAYCy8gH43yYA6m9ymxhd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"67100e7d1f9d0ee4b8c9981e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1819889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Frolova","original_name":"Sasha Frolova","popularity":0.4501,"profile_path":"/38vYW76lHLmjbeO9egrCQCJsUvp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Crystal","credit_id":"67100e8b1f9d0ee4b8c99829","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5004517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Mallick","original_name":"Rose Mallick","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maya","credit_id":"67100ecddb79c9ceae0ea099","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Erlanger","original_name":"Olivia Erlanger","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100edfdb79c9ceae0ea0aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956682,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jill Ferraro","original_name":"Jill Ferraro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100ef4db79c9ceae0ea0d3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5004523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paradise  Productions","original_name":"Paradise  Productions","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f0c1f9d0ee4b8c998a0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3894233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ani Schroeter","original_name":"Ani Schroeter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f21db79c9ceae0ea0de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685809,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Longacre-White","original_name":"Andrea Longacre-White","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f341f9d0ee4b8c998b2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1614704,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mia Cioffi Henry","original_name":"Mia Cioffi Henry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f421b912add2edb8e28","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Varya Rootwood","original_name":"Varya Rootwood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f4f1f9d0ee4b8c998c5","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715624,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ariel Nehorayoff","original_name":"Ariel Nehorayoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f5e1f9d0ee4b8c998cd","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5004525,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elysia Belilove","original_name":"Elysia Belilove","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100f9e6bffa14cf410f032","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133575,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Nina Carelli","original_name":"Nina Carelli","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67100fa96bffa14cf410f03a","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"APPLIANCE (Trailer)","key":"949048098","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-22T08:00:53.000Z","id":"6710104ccf8de877b49f70e5"}]}}}
