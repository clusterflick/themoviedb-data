The film was then imperfectly developed by hand, which created a tension between the two surfaces at play: the film and the moon. The title of this film was given to that roll by my dear friend Alexander Gabriel three years after I had filmed and discarded it. Only then, after an artist I respected had appreciated and named the work, did I decide to consider it a film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/g5w7Pitp9FxUKzjCO30UjpYUPRS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lunario","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Borja Rodríguez Gimeno","original_name":"Borja Rodríguez Gimeno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710bd3fdb79c9ceae0edbd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1556,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g5w7Pitp9FxUKzjCO30UjpYUPRS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1037}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
