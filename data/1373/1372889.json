Hugo complains that he feels an impulsive revulsion tinged with hatred for Jews. Freud accepts him for an analysis. Hugo befriends a struggling artist obsessed with vegetarianism and German nationalism, Adolf. Filmed in contemporary New York City—particularly in the Bronx—V13 portrays the origins of the Nazi Weltenschaung. Alan Cumming gives an extraordinary performance as SIgmund Freud.
