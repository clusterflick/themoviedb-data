The photo travels the world and is awarded the most important prizes in photojournalism, such as the Pulitzer Prize and the World Press. Throughout this documentary, photographers, editors and witnesses reveal various aspects surrounding that image: who is the priest, who was its author, the events that surrounded the photographic event, what was its political role and what said image represents in the history of Venezuelan journalism. Additionally, it allows the presentation of other photographs, some unpublished, that Rondón managed to capture in those difficult moments.","popularity":0.1746,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2010-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Final Absolution: History of a Photograph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Llano","original_name":"Fernando Llano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"670fcc16b04168fc8ab2a1de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tulio Ramirez","original_name":"Tulio Ramirez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"670fcc2a4f91f681b0e8d775","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramon J.
