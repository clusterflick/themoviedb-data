As one half of Morecambe and Wise, Britain's most successful comedy team, he enjoyed the lifestyle of the rich and famous. It was a partnership that lasted 46 years - until Eric died in 1984. Then his \"little fat friend\" had to go on alone. Being number two in their act was never easy for Ernie, and a new solo act has proved even more difficult. Last Christmas, for the first time in 20 years, he appeared in pantomime. This film examines what drives him to want to make a comeback when he could be enjoying his retirement. He is seen preparing for panto, remembering the great times, reliving the jokes; Ernie reveals all, including the hairpiece and the join.","popularity":0.2075,"poster_path":"/lNmvy8KZTkUpenI9oW3NZyTmT3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Importance of Being Ernie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Wise","original_name":"Ernie Wise","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":"/4rTXmgx0lPeb1nIdd8M3vGKLdxd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f98c104331db4b11285a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eddie Braben","original_name":"Eddie Braben","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f98d401c85c4fd81a5714","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Burdon","original_name":"Bryan Burdon","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f98ef01c85c4fd81a571f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4489075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Cotton","original_name":"Bill Cotton","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f98e1547de4a74f60db61","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell England","original_name":"Russell England","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f98b8547de4a74f60db48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lNmvy8KZTkUpenI9oW3NZyTmT3Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
