I made it as a twenty-something trainee producer at BBC Television in 1989. The suffering, faith and hope of the Armenian people at the time shook me profoundly, forever more. Almost 20 years on, we are releasing the film again in the hope that it can be used to help raise money for the Armenian people today. May their courage and strength be an inspiration to us all.\" - Agnieszka Piotrowska, director.","popularity":0.1219,"poster_path":"/9Tp19CiKV2YszDNWtxXsA4UIhUO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Ruins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Piotrowska","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671122011f9d0ee4b8ca084e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Tp19CiKV2YszDNWtxXsA4UIhUO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
