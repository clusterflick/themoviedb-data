If a canary died, they knew the air was bad. This film is about human canaries - some of the first victims of a newly recognised and devastating illness emerging in America. People are being poisoned by some of the 60,000 chemicals in everyday use. A group of chemically ill people have found refuge in unusual homes in the clean air of the small Texan town of Wimberley - with painful and bizarre results.","popularity":0.0838,"poster_path":"/ep8GHk2rmBOco5TVYHv7W2RQ100.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Canaries Stop Singing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1000620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Edginton","original_name":"John Edginton","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671126e01f9d0ee4b8ca0ab6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ep8GHk2rmBOco5TVYHv7W2RQ100.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
