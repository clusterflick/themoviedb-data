The regulars call it \"knackers' night\" - \"because they're terrible\". The performers, all with varying degrees of physical and mental disabilities, see themselves as serious entertainers and are largely unaware that they are being mocked. The audience finds their incompetence hilarious and the pub makes a lot of money, but some locals are appalled. \"These poor unfortunates are up there being mocked and exploited. It shouldn't be allowed.\" But should they really be protected from doing what they clearly enjoy?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/edexKeqPwTtsNgGZ2W7x4tH6sn5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elvis in Jarrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Catliff","original_name":"Nick Catliff","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/AcfTCI0cPtUBOY27fhvzu7xiM7h.jpg","credit_id":"6711296fdb79c9ceae0f11ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edexKeqPwTtsNgGZ2W7x4tH6sn5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
