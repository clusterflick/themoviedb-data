In doing so, the artist presents a real-life subject accompanied by a physical object that may soon disappear, to offer a new perspective on the boundary between fiction and reality. For example, Han’s image collages, deconstructed from the flow of the scenario, are composed of prints and drawings on 16mm film, summoning the physical external conditions that are played through a projector.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/mz75vLSWjDBWy7aTy4IPyT0idTs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bertinker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5004107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uri Han","original_name":"Uri Han","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670fe8c91b912add2edb7ac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mz75vLSWjDBWy7aTy4IPyT0idTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
