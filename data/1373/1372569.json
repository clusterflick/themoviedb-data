A father and his son reside in the mountains, where the father works as a stonemason, shouldering the weight of their family’s needs through arduous labor. Intrigued by what lies beyond the mountain, the son incessantly queries his father. Each time, the father’s response is the same, “Beyond the mountains, lies another mountain.” As the son matures, he ventures away from his father and their home, seeking his own path in a distant city beyond the mountain’s grasp, unraveling life’s meaning. After years of relentless pursuit and self-discovery, the son gains deeper insight into his father’s life and comprehends the significance of mountains to him. Filled with newfound certainty, the son returns to the mountains, where he answers his father, “Beyond the mountains is another mountain!”.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father's Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
