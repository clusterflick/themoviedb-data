Through in-depth interviews with key figures from notable organizations like Naturei Karta, Friends of Al-Aqsa, and Jewish Voices for Labour, along with perspectives from local government officials and self-exiled Israelis, this documentary offers a rich tapestry of voices and viewpoints. Blending sit-down interviews, on-the-ground footage, live reactions from demonstrations, and expert analysis, provides a comprehensive exploration of the movement's effectiveness in raising awareness, shaping public opinion, and influencing policy changes. At its core, the documentary underscores the movement's urgent call for a ceasefire and the prevention of further loss of life in the ongoing conflict.","popularity":0.0609,"poster_path":"/9w7XWKgc7Cyl6qoEvMHbx7yotkZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Faces of Solidarity: UK Protesters for Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elhanan Beck","original_name":"Elhanan Beck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f9b797a22bf3607f2a445","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haim Bresheeth","original_name":"Haim Bresheeth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f9b86019f3bc5b11be93c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goubran Bahou","original_name":"Goubran Bahou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f9b91019f3bc5b11be948","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Roberts","original_name":"Marion Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670f9b9833e1478f766de486","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taha Seder","original_name":"Taha Seder","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f9adf01c85c4fd81a57ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanzeel Gakhar","original_name":"Tanzeel Gakhar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f9afe04331db4b11286cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003632,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zakariya Irfan","original_name":"Zakariya Irfan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f9b1704331db4b11286f2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erik Duda","original_name":"Erik Duda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f9b3204331db4b112871c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003636,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Riak","original_name":"Alex Riak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f9b45547de4a74f60dcf4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003637,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isabell Jezek","original_name":"Isabell Jezek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f9b53019f3bc5b11be929","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33270613","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9w7XWKgc7Cyl6qoEvMHbx7yotkZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Nazra Palestine Short Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Faces of Solidarity: UK Protestors for Palestine TRAILER","key":"FlEubD6p0Ms","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-17T17:30:07.000Z","id":"670f9d1e04331db4b1128850"}]}}}
