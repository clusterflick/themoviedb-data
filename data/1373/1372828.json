The video Intervention in the neighbourhood of Can Serra (L'Hospitalet de Llobregat) was carried out from January to March 1978. Four videos were made as part of the project: Qué viene el metro!, Història Urbanística, Escuela de adultos and El barrio de las fiestas. The video was prepared and produced with the participation of the residents. It presents the process of speculative urban construction of the Can Serra neighbourhood, with interventions by neighbours, architects and local representatives. This video opened the debate on the present and future of the neighbourhood. Video-Nou's intervention in Can Serra was the first attempt to use video as an instrument to dynamise social and community life in Spain.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/uA6QOI1Q67jh7zmwEqGatHwlytf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Col.lectiu Video-Nou","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1978-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Planning History (Can Serra Project)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Urban Planning History (Can Serra Project)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Historia urbanística (proyecto Can Serra)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hPiBMdyiG0oIVAJcDpBnBHnr0jV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ca15Qbp92CBdwOjq43xx4o0uHVi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vTufON3g86fDGJZDURsItxehbv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7AR7dn8NKTtURxnYM0jdJ0k612s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/uA6QOI1Q67jh7zmwEqGatHwlytf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Bobina","release_date":"2023-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CO- Festival Internacional de Cinema Cooperatiu","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
