When Ross suspects Flo of harboring Ormsby, he fires a pistol at her closet. Later when Ormsby is found shot in his house, Ross confesses, believing himself guilty. Sick at heart, Flo returns to the stage of the Winter Palace. Ross is freed, however, when Ormsby’s enemy, Maddox, confesses to the crime, and Flo is happily reconciled with Ross.","popularity":0.396,"poster_path":"/e4soyPHISuZpFT2bWZCrUK0vZ7C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of a brave hearted chorus girl-pink tights-spot lights-blue blooded aristocrats and mystery.","title":"Out of the Chorus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"A Corista","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Brady","original_name":"Alice Brady","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":"/v9XVx9jV7ntUKog525jrYkSnq3n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Florence Maddis","credit_id":"671114501b912add2edbf7f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Steele","original_name":"Vernon Steele","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/AnlR0BKtAzcQWqSdglDhkUBcHUo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ross Van Beekman","credit_id":"6711145a6bffa14cf4114732","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles K.
