Through an intense field work carried out by anthropologists and documentarians, the main identitarian expressions related to sea culture were registered. With all the gathered information, workshops were done with the area's women, searching for self-identification and audiovisual record of these participants. This piece is, then, the result of the will to give voice to a traditionally silenced, but historically present, collective from coastal cultures.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/qyhrpj6VRskiwFXfx21zetZRzh1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La memoria de las mareas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Las mujeres en la cultura marítima","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5005580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álvaro Gea","original_name":"Álvaro Gea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e22bdb79c9ceae0eeae3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5005580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álvaro Gea","original_name":"Álvaro Gea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e23d1b912add2edbd7bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5005581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clara Macías","original_name":"Clara Macías","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e2521b912add2edbd7d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5005584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alberto López","original_name":"Alberto López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e2711b912add2edbd7ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950266,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kiko Romero","original_name":"Kiko Romero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e2d2cf8de877b49faf19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrés Zoilo","original_name":"Andrés Zoilo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e2e06f7707af40fa8af7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5005593,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Javier Esquivias","original_name":"Javier Esquivias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6710e2fa6bffa14cf4112c1f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qyhrpj6VRskiwFXfx21zetZRzh1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
