One day, a charming man named Faheem comes to the check post and meets Karun. This marks the beginning of a romance, which, from the outset, is doomed – Faheem, bound by the societal taboos surrounding homosexuality in the context of his religion, cannot live openly, while Karun, due to the constraints of his profession, must also hide his true self. The film explores the intersection of love, identity, and repression in a region steeped in conflict.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/hMMA5WH9nW1Gwd4tofwv2FP9nQ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kashmiri","iso_639_1":"ks","name":""},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Faheem & Karun","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4486281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mir Salman","original_name":"Mir Salman","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"671c50fac7802cc5035a1c3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sana Javed","original_name":"Sana Javed","popularity":1.2399,"profile_path":"/kxcDS68Y6xIqIsRpKUi5THh9PEG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"671c51045d0de89042d92907","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Onir","original_name":"Onir","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":"/hrlqEYIuTSz6YBUybxP2RMLsZ43.jpg","credit_id":"670f7e8f547de4a74f60d0c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815442,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ramananda Sarkar","original_name":"Ramananda Sarkar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c5138b3d5cbb842f425dc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756135,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arun Nambiar","original_name":"Arun Nambiar","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c51484542e371fe0a9282","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fawzia Mirza","original_name":"Fawzia Mirza","popularity":0.0489,"profile_path":"/bqjoExDRdZsylnLyCGsuPZUEXDd.jpg","credit_id":"671c5179b3d5cbb842f425fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Onir","original_name":"Onir","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":"/hrlqEYIuTSz6YBUybxP2RMLsZ43.jpg","credit_id":"671c5184769107d77b47d2d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34284832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pYhipc1V7mpCO97IFKQ3luu4hVa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45oWsOlj4DlPQ7sCcBLTf4Dyqd7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":951,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/osobZ3orCeKwTY4Fxl03sCwdqR9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1691}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hMMA5WH9nW1Gwd4tofwv2FP9nQ9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1509,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/abext8wSeqt3hnFq2f7jnDO5xsC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1006}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ks","note":"Dharamshala International Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
