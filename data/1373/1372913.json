To the Warlis, a community of Adivasis (indigenous peoples), who live close to Bombay, these stories represent their history, their world-view. All the outsiders, the Portuguese, the Marathas, the British, the native settlers… they all tried obliterating this history and wisdom. The work of the outsiders who wrote about the Warli represents this process of creating new mythologies. By bringing together these disparate discourses, this video aspires to critique these mythologies… To read between the lines, as the stories themselves do.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/jh46IAgRS7fMDoy2AvkdbJ0KZNE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story Maker : Story Taker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anjali Monteiro","original_name":"Anjali Monteiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6711b1c91f0ea4714edbd536","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K.P.
