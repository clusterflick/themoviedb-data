It is used to describe a short distance from point A to point B. Taking this saying a starting point, I invite my friends to throw stones and to literally use the distance as a unit of measure while I film and stand stand 15 meters away from them [the lenght of a Super 8 cartridge].  Trying to work in the space between language, film and performance. All editing done in camera. The lenght/duration of the film is one single Super 8 cartridge run at 16FPS.
