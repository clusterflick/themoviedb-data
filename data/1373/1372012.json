Filmmaker Timothy Mahoney investigates this by exploring ancient prophecies made by Moses, which predicted Israel’s rise as a kingdom, its fall due to breaking the covenant, the scattering of its people, their persecution, and eventual return to the land. Using archaeological evidence and expert insights, Mahoney delves into these events, raising deeper questions about Israel's suffering, their chosen status, and its relevance today. Part two of a two-part film series exploring these themes.","popularity":0.1246,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thinking Man Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Patterns of Evidence: The Israel Dilemma – Part 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118322,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Timothy P.
