Zuhara is on her way to her younger sister’s wedding, when she picks up Neriman, a young Bedouin hitchhiker escaping from an arranged marriage. As she unintentionally becomes an accomplice in Neriman’s struggle, Zuhara must confront her conflicted feelings toward her estrangement from her own family. Director Rony Sasson Angel sensitively evokes moving drama through the characters’ quiet exchanges, while building to a powerful climax. Stars Hila Vidor and Maisa Abed Elhadi make the tension and camaraderie between these two strangers palpable and touching. A deeply-poignant and visually-striking road movie.","popularity":0.5543,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2015-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wherever You Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lean She'at Nosa'at","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1027675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilla Vidor","original_name":"הילה וידור","popularity":0.2235,"profile_path":"/uG88E7eVJRU3Mo4EFJYCdliENzO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf89251416c7512b92b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1079533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maisa Abd Elhadi","original_name":"Maisa Abd Elhadi","popularity":0.2931,"profile_path":"/oB1GjX3FcVjvmFa4casNGc7XR6f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf89251416c7512b92f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahir Cabha","original_name":"Shahir Cabha","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf89251416c7512b933","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2123223","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":157632,"name":"fraternity"},{"id":222901,"name":"clash of cultures"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wherever You Go- לאן שאת נוסעת","key":"SZaVH4vacZM","published_at":"2012-08-25T09:47:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"56c08172c3a36817f900b975"}]}}}
