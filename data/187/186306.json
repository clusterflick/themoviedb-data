Carel, a porn actress, and Ferd, a drug addict, invite the camera to participate in their wedding, their sex life, and their break-up. Produced before the landmark PBS documentary An American Family introduced television audiences to the live-in camera — and many decades before the ubiquity of reality television — this document raises questions about the relationship between subject and camera, privacy and manipulation. Originally presented as an installation, this one-hour version, which includes interviews with Carel, Ferd and Ginsberg, was distilled from thirty hours of footage recorded from 1970 to 1975. - Electronic Arts Intermix","popularity":0.3369,"poster_path":"/rkt3lkmhrg2ISfw0YL5IwBbAcUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Data Bank","origin_country":""},{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3355871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ferd Eggan","original_name":"Ferd Eggan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61c3d0d0a93d250061a8e18c","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3523651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carel Rowe","original_name":"Carel Rowe","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"626781a01967570067a32ed8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Ginsberg","original_name":"Arthur Ginsberg","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf99251416c7512bac1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2055763","wikidata_id":"Q20874589","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oaaboYCtITEFvnBVYg4vkEmEJFh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rkt3lkmhrg2ISfw0YL5IwBbAcUU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":1925,"name":"camera"},{"id":3183,"name":"bisexuality"},{"id":13027,"name":"wedding"},{"id":15126,"name":"historical"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":177185,"name":"videotape"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"},{"id":257759,"name":"sov"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":296056,"name":"seventies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd Top # 9 Facts","key":"BoDrnan8PDg","published_at":"2015-10-30T00:50:55.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5919dbe5925141061e054f8e"}]}}}
