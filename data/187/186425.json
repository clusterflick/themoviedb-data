A skunk tries to buy a ticket, costing a nickel, but he only has one scent. He looks for a way to sneak in. Meanwhile, Porky introduces the show: a collection of cartoons, drawn as stick figures. At the end, the audience is all gone because the skunk managed to sneak in. Porky's cartoons include: Circus Parade, Choo-Choo Train, Soldiers (Marchin), Horse Race, and Dances (hula, Mexican hat, and ballet). All accompanied by a self-parody musical score.","popularity":0.5071,"poster_path":"/u4TcggtIcA5o0V8D9nTlRDOoX2g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porky's Preview","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Porky Pig (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"54e8e240c3a3684ea6001b00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Berner","original_name":"Sara Berner","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/cUvyj2PuoHU5FAtep9oOxLYaQEp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Various (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"54e8e22fc3a36836e000249a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Nazarro","original_name":"Cliff Nazarro","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/aC8CWA9B3Dm2w8OJWkXArqfhAFy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Various (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"54e8e251c3a3684ea6001b03","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tex Avery","original_name":"Tex Avery","popularity":0.5622,"profile_path":"/4jimJwW6FNAxBuM2CD1cZLK6Q5C.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cfb9251416c7512c06d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980524,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Monahan","original_name":"Dave Monahan","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/vjnwtC0HLtYSKsjJR0OWEzfmhNg.jpg","credit_id":"643b1aee4d67910521d731f2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl W.
