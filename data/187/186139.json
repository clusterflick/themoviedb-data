Aside from usual highlights such as Pyongyang or Arirang, this unique one-man documentary brings you to areas such as Chongjin or Wonson, still virtually unknown to even google or wikipedia. There, I attempt to pierce through the ever-present 'national mythology' and as much as possible, I try to connect with people - such as the waitress mesmerized by tablet computers, or a tour guide cautiously fascinated by modern pop culture.","popularity":0.4888,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"North Korea lies somewhere between a 1930′s Soviet Union frozen in time and a dark, futuristic vision of society… as imagined back in the 70′s.","title":"DPRK: The Land Of Whispers","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Dworzanczyk","original_name":"Matt Dworzanczyk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b625cd9251412440000a6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2885450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":261734,"name":"north korea"},{"id":270373,"name":"pyongyang, north korea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DPRK: Land of Whispers TRAILER (North Korea Travel Documentary)","key":"1EtfqpEX4UQ","published_at":"2013-01-02T04:31:45.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec70ac3a368544800a692"}]}}}
