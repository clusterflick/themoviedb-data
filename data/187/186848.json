So Pooch goes to the back of his butcher shop and selects one, and understandably the chicken in question is less than cooperative in going along with the idea, but ends up in the basket. At Pooch's girl's house both Pooch and chicken face off with the pet cat, who is particularly conniving; the cat winds up running off with the chicken.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/icdxZE7IU6Sden6OLfCiGDut4AI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Butcher Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d089251416c7512db6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142142","wikidata_id":"Q7720769","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/icdxZE7IU6Sden6OLfCiGDut4AI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
