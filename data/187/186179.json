In 2006, Ilan Halimi, a French Jewish salesman is lured to the outskirts of Paris where he is kidnapped and later murdered by criminal gang who had demanded a half-million euro ransom on the assumption that 'all Jews are rich'. Jews &amp; Money is a probe into the myth about Jews, and where and when it took root. Why is the Jew so often cast as the banker or trader, pawnbroker or movie mogul? Of all the medieval moneylenders, why is only Shylock remembered? How did the Rothschilds become the symbols of international capitalism? And why does a simple cell phone salesman get pegged as rich, and die for it?","popularity":0.1039,"poster_path":"/tV1vPF549sNj0wulcs4wMfWp7cf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lewis Cohen’s documentary centers on the Ilan Halimi case.","title":"Jews and Money: Investigation of a Myth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Jews and Money","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les Juifs et l'Argent, du Mythe à la Réalité","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les Juifs et l'Argent","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Jews and Money: Investigation of a Myth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Cohen","original_name":"Lewis Cohen","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/jwAfMXNkKZrKbe3UobXFRx3L9bx.jpg","credit_id":"537cc1c9c3a36854df00142e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Cohen","original_name":"Lewis Cohen","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/jwAfMXNkKZrKbe3UobXFRx3L9bx.jpg","credit_id":"537cc203c3a36854f40013e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322143,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Cadieux","original_name":"Paul Cadieux","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537cc1e6c3a36854f70013b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Cohen","original_name":"Lewis Cohen","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/jwAfMXNkKZrKbe3UobXFRx3L9bx.jpg","credit_id":"537cc1d3c3a36854f70013a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2084861","wikidata_id":"Q65055340","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1571,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tV1vPF549sNj0wulcs4wMfWp7cf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1048}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
