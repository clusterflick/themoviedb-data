The film shows how the musicians relate to daily life and the way their perception of reality influences their music.  Firm belief in superstitions, the unavoidable blows of fate, communication with the dead, become the sources of inspiration and expression, of joy and sorrow.  Alexandra Guleaâ€™s unconventional documentary takes us on a musical journey to the origins of romanian gypsy music.","popularity":0.0582,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Today I was Young and Pretty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Gulea","original_name":"Alexandra Gulea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c5df8f534661017b8b74e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2158126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
