They are called 'sky walkers' because they walk fearlessly atop steel beams just a foot wide, high above the city. In this nuanced portrait of modern Native Americans' double lives, Jerry McDonald Thundercloud and his colleague Sky shuttle between the hard-drinking Brooklyn lodging houses they call home during the week and their rural reservation, a grueling drive six hours north, where a family weekend awaits. While the men are away working, their wives often struggle to keep their children away from the illegal temptations of an economically deprived area.","popularity":0.2579,"poster_path":"/8OcKXzFBwoKnpZDz06HS5RLgpwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Penelope
