In its 72nd year, the 24-Hour race has lived up to its legendary status as the greatest endurance race in the world. This official review captures the atmosphere and sense of occasion that only a visit to the Circuit de la Sarthe can provide.  In true Le Mans style, inspired driving ensured the 24-Hours was anything but dull with breakdowns and crashes adding to the already intense action. And with only 40 seconds separating the first two cars, the entertainment went right to the finish.  A late charge from Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx's Johnny Herbert ensured a nail-biting finale to an already action packed race. But in the end it was Audi Sport Team Gohâ€™s Seiji Ara who took the chequered flag. This win for Team Goh gave co-driver Tom Kristensen his 5th consecutive victory and record-equalling sixth title overall.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 2004","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 2004","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
