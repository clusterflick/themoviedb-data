Told through a relentless barrage of 1-4 frame clips from television, film, advertising, YouTube videos and stock footage, the film explores themes of paranoia, social isolation and identity. After years of abusing psychedelics, dissociatives and research chemicals, I became obsessed with the mind-altering capabilities of images, particularly social media, pornography, mobile games and slot machines. The film, which contains over 20,000 individual clips drawing from 4TB of material downloaded from soulseek and torrent sites, starts with the creation of the universe and ends with the apocalypse, taking a look at consumerism, internet culture, raving, bulimia, drug abuse, gender dysphoria, and loneliness along the way.\"","popularity":0.0926,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easy Win","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4525195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Quinn","original_name":"Gloria Quinn","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c4eef86dc5070184fcecd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Icebox Project Space - 20/92 Video Festival","release_date":"2024-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
