The recordings were made at the end of the 1980s and during the 1990s. Some of the wedding customs have been preserved and are practiced today, others have experienced a transformation, and others were on the verge of being forgotten and were finally remembered in this film. Early and arranged marriages and the cult of virginity are an integral part of the Roma tradition. The older and younger generations talk about those customs that were dictated by their wandering past and to what extent these customs are desirable today.","popularity":0.162,"poster_path":"/oVhmNurjkG6GZwuVQyLIYygvKug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Raeto-Romance","iso_639_1":"rm","name":""},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Apple Doesn’t Fall Far from the Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bojan Dakić","original_name":"Bojan Dakić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6a61c9451e701847a016a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103290,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Goran Velemir","original_name":"Goran Velemir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6a63fb6cff10164a42a88","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2350752,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pavle Nikić","original_name":"Pavle Nikić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6a65054a0980163006b22","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bojan Dakić","original_name":"Bojan Dakić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603eda6dbf144017d037dbc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31107455","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oVhmNurjkG6GZwuVQyLIYygvKug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Apple Doesn't Fall Far From the Tree - TRAILER","key":"mH8lIbj1XUw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-05T18:01:44.000Z","id":"65c6a5c4aad9c2017db56501"}]}}}
