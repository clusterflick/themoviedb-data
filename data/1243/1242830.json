The ‘Bentley Boys’ were back at their spiritual home and MG also made a welcome comeback with the Lola EX257.  Eight manufacturers, including the defending Audi Sport Team Joest, plus a host of top-flight privateer GTs were on the grid for the start of what promised to be an exciting race.  Torrential rain just four laps in to the race caused havoc with cars still running on dry or intermediate tyres and a six car pile-up and the changeable conditions kept teams on their toes throughout the following 23 hours.  Despite the downpours, the atmosphere was as lively as ever and the thrills just kept on coming.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 2001","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 2001","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
