The short film was shot in the Vatican gardens between June and July of that year (possibly on January 4), after a long wait and negotiations with the prefect of the Apostolic Chamber Francesco Salesio Della Volpe and with the intercession of the pontiff's nephew, Count Pecci. It is a montage of three different shots with the blessing of Pope Leo XIII, eighty-eight years old at the time, and was probably filmed on Kodak film.","popularity":0.1414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1898-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Holiness Pope Leo XIII","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"His Holiness Pope Leo XIII","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2310918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pope Leo XIII","original_name":"Pope Leo XIII","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mGjdbmBskNlLOMyf1wVQpcEQe0J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65c49ad6713ed40185175ef8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4524812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Salesio Della Volpe","original_name":"Francesco Salesio Della Volpe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65c49afa194186017b75dd88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4524813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Merry del Val","original_name":"Rafael Merry del Val","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65c49b15713ed4016c172e03","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William K.L.
