About two thirds of the United State's bees are imported to California's Central Valley every year to pollinate the endless fields of almond orchards. At the heart of the film is a 74 year old bee broker, Joe Traynor, who has worked all his life cultivating bees and managing beekeepers. The film portrays the current catastrophic state of bees and Joe's last pollination season as the Central Valley's most prolific bee broker.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1DhmNE0DtMJJTltMucCrmhzonnt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Threshold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339305,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kārlis Bergs","original_name":"Kārlis Bergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5dedeb7a15401867da2a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4572188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Siedenburg","original_name":"Andrew Siedenburg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5df0344a424014a11136f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339305,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kārlis Bergs","original_name":"Kārlis Bergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5def1a672540162aa9a63","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339305,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kārlis Bergs","original_name":"Kārlis Bergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5decdc99826016262cbcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28656493","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1DhmNE0DtMJJTltMucCrmhzonnt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
