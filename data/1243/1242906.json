She's not aware he is blind but when he misses the handkerchief she is trying to pass him, she realizes. She feels sorry for him but then he charms her with his conversation and acute sense of smell. They agree to meet again but June is late and Alistair is beset with doubts about her interest in him. When she shows up he can't hide his irritation. Eventually they make up and arrange a proper date. They picnic and Alistair introduces June to the many and varied scents of roses when he guides her, blindfolded, through the gardens. At last they kiss. Alistair caresses June face which comes into focus for the first time.","popularity":0.0539,"poster_path":"/f0rEAt1YpfgldBLhb0gQK8AJmCw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8445,"logo_path":null,"name":"â€¢IndiePix Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":8509,"logo_path":null,"name":"IndiePix Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2014-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Handkerchief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Hawker","original_name":"Luke Hawker","popularity":0.15,"profile_path":"/kKLXCalV2OOdtPYWXdGsv7waPXb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alistair","credit_id":"65c66c8894d8a8018312ad58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Van Beek","original_name":"Claire Van Beek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"June","credit_id":"65c66c8f94d8a8018312ad68","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3342649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Niccol","original_name":"Linda Niccol","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c66c9e8e20c5017d342981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3342649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Niccol","original_name":"Linda Niccol","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c66ca61b70ae0184a3c9b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3130656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1214,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f0rEAt1YpfgldBLhb0gQK8AJmCw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":809}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
