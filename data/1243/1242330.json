Although the current building only opened in 1961, the history of the house on Bismarckstrasse goes back even further: It was built in 1912 and, on the initiative of a group of people from Berlin-Charlottenburg, opened as a citizen opera house, in contrast to the Royal Court Opera, today State Opera Unter den Linden. The film illustrates all facets of the different eras of this Berlin opera institution, from its beginnings to the present day, through interviews with artists closely associated with the Deutsche Oper Berlin, as well as a variety of archive material, including documentation of recent rehearsals and performances 100 years.","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":"/sKNmkRDepyB7kzn1Suvcf86vCOT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ouverture 1912 - The Deutsche Oper Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2876402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sKNmkRDepyB7kzn1Suvcf86vCOT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
