In addition to the President of the Federal Republic of Germany and a selection of diplomats and politicians, high-ranking guests included theatrical directors from West Germany and other Western European countries, composers, conductors, actors, writers, painters and sculptors, not to mention rectors and lecturers from Berlin's universities and the world's leading music critics. [...] The success was commensurate with the significance of the occasion. All involved in the performance received countless ovations in front of the magnificent yellow curtain. The new building - and the new stage with its state-of-the-art technology - had shown itself to be more than capable of handling Mozart's most demanding work.","popularity":0.1717,"poster_path":"/nFc1Hqad3XxwoaDJ02RJoUqzya1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Oper Berlin","origin_country":""},{"id":7024,"logo_path":"/r59UjG4QqARcBYrTnEKc2YIOWSI.png","name":"Sender Freies Berlin","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau","original_name":"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cliPNLk9DNIy7vPglYAijmVq6bY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"65c661621b70ae0184a3c006","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2133916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Greindl","original_name":"Josef Greindl","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/jz5kWAHok4ZlCPlSEvqho6pPjoq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Komtur","credit_id":"65c6616e1c6aa701809a7b7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Grümmer","original_name":"Elisabeth Grümmer","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Anna","credit_id":"65c66181dbcade017b70c5c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2356264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Grobe","original_name":"Donald Grobe","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Don Ottavio","credit_id":"65c661938e20c50164336580","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1895332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pilar Lorengar","original_name":"Pilar Lorengar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nrLaMfl2krFK0HO6JBGyMsfmBQ8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Donna Elvira","credit_id":"65c661a51b70ae0163a3054c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Sardi","original_name":"Ivan Sardi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"65c661b5bd588b01634574db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1310839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Köth","original_name":"Erika Köth","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"65c661c3534661017b8be1c1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Berry","original_name":"Walter Berry","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":"/6VXnZVdeoWvOsaGbNuRT2nE3SyU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"65c661d341eee1017a966a18","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Ebert","original_name":"Carl Ebert","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c66218bd588b0184463a90","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527497,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ferenc Fricsay","original_name":"Ferenc Fricsay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c661fbaa659e0164ee5ac7","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384701,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Georges Wakhévitch","original_name":"Georges Wakhévitch","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6622dfd7aa40182991dad","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1985063","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":2173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nFc1Hqad3XxwoaDJ02RJoUqzya1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1518}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1961-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
