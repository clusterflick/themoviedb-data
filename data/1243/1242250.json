Delving into the rhythm of the story rooted in shamanistic rites, we follow the life of Sim Hakgyu â€“ a blind master of swords who roams through a post-apocalyptic world contaminated with blinding dust using his sensitive hearing to get a sense of direction. The viewer experiences his reality in the same way, through sound waves bouncing off shapes. The world built with sounds appears to us as a volumetric cloud of colorful points hanging in the air, creating the afterimages of the sung story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/94BpmP6deCQ41gbWnYdtPvdXp3l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SIM: the Blind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/94BpmP6deCQ41gbWnYdtPvdXp3l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
