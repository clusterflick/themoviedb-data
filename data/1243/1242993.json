Over the seasons, volunteers organize the burial of people who have experienced living on the street, trying to bring together their families and loved ones so that they do not leave alone, in oblivion and indifference. Each year, about twenty ceremonies are held in the cemetery of Cornebarrieu on the outskirts of Toulouse. A presence, gestures, songs, and stories accompany these deceased. Through their presence, which might seem vain, at the funerals of strangers, these volunteers question the scope and meaning of such a commitment beyond religious beliefs. By offering a dignified ceremony to the most precarious, they contribute, in a spirit of brotherhood, to honoring their memory. For the true tomb of the dead is the heart of the living.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/zAER7Xg6z5MMQ5W1vvn87IXbSoJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Hearts of the Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Duclos","original_name":"Marielle Duclos","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6aa2bd7107e0166ef04f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Duclos","original_name":"Marielle Duclos","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6aa36b6cff10185a445b2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Duclos","original_name":"Marielle Duclos","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6aa87ce6c4c0163b7cf90","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802788,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mathias Touzeris","original_name":"Mathias Touzeris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6aaa1d7107e0166ef056a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802789,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gilles Pedoussaut","original_name":"Gilles Pedoussaut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6aab7ce6c4c0163b7cfa5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31105785","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zAER7Xg6z5MMQ5W1vvn87IXbSoJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toulouse, premiere","release_date":"2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
