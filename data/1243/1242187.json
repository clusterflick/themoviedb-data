As a foreign worker and an observer of Korea, Thura depicts social inequalities and discrepancies against alien workers while sharing his poetic comments on the glamour and dark sides of the modern capitalist society. Using empathetic power of VR and the poetic quality of volumetric point cloud imagery, creators of this project wish the audience to become Thura and experience the anger, sadness, alienation and nostalgia of an alien worker in a foreign country. Not just in Korea, but anywhere in the world. In this ever-changing capitalist world, everyone is an alien.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nPgEqNfMRB4ChuiRJL0CCXllqWH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain Fruits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12714842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nPgEqNfMRB4ChuiRJL0CCXllqWH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
