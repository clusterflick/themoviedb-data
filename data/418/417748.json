Why did this happen ? Was it skill and leadership, the training, the quality and bravery of the soldiers, luck, a successful artillery barrage or poor German performance. Most probably a bit of all these factors. This is the story of the 7th Bedfords,  a Kitchener battalion in General Maxse's 18th Eastern Div. The Bedfords captured all their objectives, assisted the units on their flanks and established a new defensive line a mile beyond their objective.","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Somme 1916: Pommiers Redoubt","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Somme 1916 - Pommiers Redoubt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Somme 1916: Pommiers Redoubt - 7th Bedfords","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"57e69c879251412ae30086e1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
