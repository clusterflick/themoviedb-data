Opposite her, in the role of Adriana, is a soprano who as a Verdi and verismo specialist also appears regularly at all the major international opera houses, Micaela Carosi. The 'cock-of-the-walk' role is sung by the world-class tenor Marcelo Álvarez. His timbre, velvety smooth yet robustly virile, is ideally suited to a vocal characterisation of the idolised Maurizio. Conductor Renato Palumbo is very much at home with Cilea's operatic masterpiece, since the Italian Romantic and verismo periods are at the core of his extensive repertoire.","popularity":0.2164,"poster_path":"/kbBMivdPgwslBMBBsgiZbf78vtP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2009-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adriana Lecouvreur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micaela Carosi","original_name":"Micaela Carosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yGsPMkvciy4kVMY6euFIKDcQoLn.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Adriana Lecouvreur","credit_id":"57e2dbdd9251417eda001d8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Álvarez","original_name":"Marcelo Álvarez","popularity":0.1324,"profile_path":"/cs1e8vXhhAkH8ECq1FhpewriD9q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maurizio","credit_id":"57e2dbf2c3a3683a5c001ef8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1576736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Cornetti","original_name":"Marianne Cornetti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/g8ktjxQPIXVSQ0nHvStbImD63zS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Princesse de Bouillon","credit_id":"57e2dc1d9251417eda001db8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone del Savio","original_name":"Simone del Savio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hwjmdm6aL4kgOrEge0Dj7xfOevr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prince de Bouillon","credit_id":"57e2dc3dc3a3683a08001f1a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Casalin","original_name":"Luca Casalin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Abbé de Chazeuil","credit_id":"57e2dc5bc3a3683a08001f32","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfonso Antoniozzi","original_name":"Alfonso Antoniozzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/r1Duc3iQCksFFlvG01vh5o4MiJb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Michonnet","credit_id":"57e2dc8ec3a3685e0c00156e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonella de Chiara","original_name":"Antonella de Chiara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mlle.
