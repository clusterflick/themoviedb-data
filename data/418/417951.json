Currently, a high steel fence stretches over several miles strictly separating the USA and Mexico into two territories. Every year, the remains of hundreds of migrants are retrieved from the area. The tense situation in Arizona’s borderland has split the locals into two groups: one demanding a more technically advanced border control system, the other requesting more humanitarian help.  Accompanying various locals, NGO workers and self-proclaimed border guards from the region, filmmaker Gudrun Gruber raises the question of whether the latest border control technology will finally bring peace to the area, or rather merely increase the number of deaths.","popularity":0.327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gudrun Gruber Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borderland Blues","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gudrun Gruber","original_name":"Gudrun Gruber","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/t5TBndmQBfXDbVSEiEryoEgWhSk.jpg","credit_id":"57e7e8c49251412b1e0122c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1684815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernd Effenberger","original_name":"Bernd Effenberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e7e8e3c3a36835a2011b87","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684816,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gaby Kull-Neujahr","original_name":"Gaby Kull-Neujahr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e7e915925141413f014e72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5607934","wikidata_id":"Q29681079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":534,"name":"mexico"},{"id":5616,"name":"usa–mexico border"},{"id":224342,"name":"border control"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zurich Film Festival","release_date":"2016-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
