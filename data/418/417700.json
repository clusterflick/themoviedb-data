The one day, a hunter wounds a fawn. By chance, a young man, Mudal, happens to be nearby, and chases the hunter away and cures the animal. But as the animal heals, Mudal wishes that he wasn't always alone and how even the sweet sound of his flute cannot cheer his spirits nor provide him much company.
