Their light-hearted holiday is put to an abrupt end, however, when Alex receives a shocking telephone call: his brother Jun is dead. Back in Paris’s Chinatown, Alex is determined to find out what happened. While his French mother retreats into mourning, his Chinese father refuses to tell him anything in detail. The traditional wake begins and Alex is left dealing with his relatives and the imminent cultural differences.
