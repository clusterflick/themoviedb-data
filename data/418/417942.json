Having never had a father figure, she seeks affection through older men before she falls in love with a younger man called Sergio, an apprentice under her husband Miguel. The film highlights various episodes from her life, culminating in the murder of her lover, and the apparent cannibalism that follows.","popularity":0.2688,"poster_path":"/rlUvHIIuyJ3eBQbOCwDs6j9dZDg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74263,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Paso P.
