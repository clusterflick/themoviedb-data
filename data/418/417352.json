When the other ducklings are learning to fly so they can go south for the winter, Dinky lies under a shade tree sniffing the autumn air. He learns his lesson when the others fly south and he is left behind in the winter cold. But he luckily wins a free airplane-trip in a poetry contest and beats them there.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Foolish Duckling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mannie Davis","original_name":"Mannie Davis","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e3e1839251411d61002d34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
