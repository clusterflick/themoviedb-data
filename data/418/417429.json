Forever in search of the ultimate kind of freedom, she’s long ago blocked out what it is she is actually running from. At home everywhere and nowhere. Living a now-now life. Click and - next, please. Until she meets Aro (35) and Aro is different. Even if he preaches the same sermon: Just make sure not to define the status of the relationship you’re in and enjoy the summer while it lasts, not committing to anything.  And yet, without looking for it, they get under each other’s skin. Now there are expectations, jealousy nags and contradicts their frantic pursuit of independence. All of a sudden, Lou does not know anymore what it is all about. Where does she come from? Where does she belong?","popularity":0.2881,"poster_path":"/wR6Q8MVWlMDNIBlQkPQm4gKmrFs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18241,"logo_path":"/dkGRn6wYyjgE14UehpMeKiNM5FG.png","name":"2:1 Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sketches of Lou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1463229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Amuat","original_name":"Liliane Amuat","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/eA0UJQSvnbwdIdafQOiFjuG4LxJ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lou","credit_id":"57e43697c3a3687590007506","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dashmir Ristemi","original_name":"Dashmir Ristemi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aro","credit_id":"57e436a1925141123c0078ae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813417,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gaetan Varone","original_name":"Gaetan Varone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608487115c3247007764a386","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Blatter","original_name":"Lisa Blatter","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e436cb9251411df10050b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382673,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Myriam Flury","original_name":"Myriam Flury","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9720062c6b7b1da19248d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Blatter","original_name":"Lisa Blatter","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d971fadae26be0023bde216","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6351308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wR6Q8MVWlMDNIBlQkPQm4gKmrFs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2964,"name":"future"},{"id":2754,"name":"trauma"},{"id":6162,"name":"past"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":14534,"name":"relationship"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"World Premiere","release_date":"2016-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SKIZZEN VON LOU (Teaser)","key":"lIW7_6Uw1io","published_at":"2016-09-08T17:07:18.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57e4376bc3a3687589007119"}]}}}
