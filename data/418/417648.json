Part 1, \"Green Means Go,\" presents fragments of color over a musique concrete soundtrack composed of sounds recorded at the strip mall. Part 2, \"The Abecedaire,\" wrestles (and later plays) with alphabetic form extracted and abstracted from the signs of commerce of which they are normally a part. Part 3, \"X-formations,\" tries to argue that there is, in fact, beauty after strip malls. Let's hope so.
