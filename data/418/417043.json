Y. A huge elephant stands at the top of the chutes and prepares for his trip. At his back is another elephant who starts his companion. The huge animal assumes a sitting position as he leaves the top and like a flash slides down the steep incline into the water. He strikes the water with a tremendous splash, remains under the water for a short time, enjoying his cool bath. It takes considerable coaxing on the part of his Arabian keeper to get him to come out of the water.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1904-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elephants Shooting the Chutes at Luna Park","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231524","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1904-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
