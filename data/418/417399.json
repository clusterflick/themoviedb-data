He walks to Helsinki, returns to his parents' home and his old high school filled with angry radical teens who, typically for the era, consider the teacher-imposed discipline as another form of capitalist imperialism. Almost reluctantly Erik drifts together with Annika, a girl from a wealthy family, and starts experimenting with sex and marijuana. In the same nonchalant manner Erik gets involved in demonstrations and school politics which escalate into a violent school strike leading to police intervention and heavy sanctions.","popularity":0.1718,"poster_path":"/sVsXjQwz0WZXN9RiRsw9egzN7B1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38212,"logo_path":null,"name":"FJ-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1970-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilvilinna","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Luftslott","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Castle
