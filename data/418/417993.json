He is called up for a military operation in Gaza .  The APC, in which he and his unit are riding, is hit by a Hamas rocket. Nony is the sole survivor.  He comes back from Gaza a different person and is cared for by his parents and a military psychiatrist.  After lengthy psychiatric treatment Nony starts to communicate again – only now he is convinced that he is ‘Amnon’, the deceased uncle for whom he was named.  Amnon had been an unrecognized singer. Nony is not a singer and now he doesn’t even remember how to play. At first, when Nony performs, people laugh at this strange guy but then he becomes a phenomenon. When he is at the height of his success on the one hand, but also at the height of his mental disorder, Nony meets Hadas again.","popularity":0.0617,"poster_path":"/2xjnILe4Sg9xrTfZdDP1TlOpeua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Industria","origin_country":""},{"id":94643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laila Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Is Broken Up and Dances","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Everything is Broken up and Dances","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Hakol Shavur VeRoked","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nony Geffen","original_name":"Nony Geffen","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nony/Amnon","credit_id":"57e814aec3a3682227012f0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kobi Farag","original_name":"קובי פרג׳","popularity":0.1896,"profile_path":"/p9m7UGm25UzrLeLSvL4jK7637vC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57e8acbb925141395b0177b3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nony Geffen","original_name":"Nony Geffen","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e81470925141390b013daf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nony Geffen","original_name":"Nony Geffen","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b21faa925141078a098c6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5176794","wikidata_id":"Q52837441","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/afzh7LXN5Z6l79zLqGkNOpxYple.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1578,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/2xjnILe4Sg9xrTfZdDP1TlOpeua.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"הכל שבור ורוקד - טריילר HD - סרט ישראלי - נוני גפן, דודו טסה, קובי פרג'","key":"1FRvd4xoE7E","published_at":"2016-06-14T05:47:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58de5b7f9251411b7300ca53"}]}}}
