As well as exploring the masterpieces of painters such as Veronese, Rubens, David, Chardin, Gericault and Delacroix, he examines the changing face of the Louvre itself through its architecture and design. Medieval fortress, Renaissance palace, luxurious home to kings, emperors and more recently civil servants, today it attracts eight million visitors a year. The documentary also reflects the very latest transformation of the Louvre - the museum's recently-opened Islamic Gallery.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/wyVNNkQTwiwsE2o0GdlB8HMpIE4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treasures of the Louvre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJXjUk07YHruGMq3xl5uax4AdnS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wyVNNkQTwiwsE2o0GdlB8HMpIE4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jwahxtTrWOWA01kkxuMPoboS3YQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
