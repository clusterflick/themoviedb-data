People live along a narrow passageway. And there lives an old woman named Lee So-sun which means a small fairy. Ever since the death of her oldest son, Jeon Tae-il, she always lived sympathizing with the pain and sword-like life of her neighbors. Lee So-sun was the mother of all who waited for a 'humane world', standing straight in the world having no fear of anything. Young artists Baek Dae-hyun and Hong Seung-hee express the pain Jeon Tae-il and his mother Lee So-sun had to endure through their performances. What would be the meaning of Lee So-sun's life to these two artists who beautified all her pains in life? This work is about the final message left by the 'mother'.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/4evnbNYcJS7AR4tFMbQeGFauzb6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2012-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"So-Sun Lee","original_name":"So-Sun Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63086463194186007b66c0fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeon Tae-sam","original_name":"Jeon Tae-sam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6308646bca7ec6009246d35b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baek Dae-hyun","original_name":"Baek Dae-hyun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6308647519418600808a051b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Seung-yi","original_name":"Hong Seung-yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"630864970398ab007d765cb6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Morim","original_name":"Wang Morim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6308649fb7d352007bc974e0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tae Jun-seek","original_name":"Tae Jun-seek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62eb7106223a8b0058a54b14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2137,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/4evnbNYcJS7AR4tFMbQeGFauzb6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
