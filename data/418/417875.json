Scientists dismissed the legends as exaggerations, believing that the rainforest could not sustain such a huge populationâ€”until now. A new generation of explorers armed with 21st-century technology has uncovered remarkable evidence that could reinvent our understanding of the Amazon and the indigenous peoples who lived there. Using CGI and dramatic re-creations, National Geographic re-imagines the banks of the Amazon 500 years ago, teeming with inhabitants living in the Lost Cities of the Amazon.","popularity":1.0605,"poster_path":"/bOZGOXiC4G1fiDjGNQ9WJz10gf9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edge West Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Cities of the Amazon","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181685,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Martens","original_name":"William Martens","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e73faf9251416c69004133","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip J.
