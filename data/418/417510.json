In the process of projecting various folklore materials, she sees a rotten heirloom mask and awakens a certain subconscious mind in the form of the mask. Her story is the story of how a clown dancing in her cloak raped her Thatcher's wife, causing her to plunge into her well. Eomjang-ho, who is engaged in the final practice of her sandae play mask dance, suffers from more vague fear because of her succession mask written on his face. Meanwhile, Oh Hyo-jin, unable to meet Jang-ho after the incident in the auditorium, goes down to the countryside with her classmates as a member of the archaeological excavation team. Even after she begins excavating the archaeological site, she is still depressed and asks if it's because her advisor loves her mother-in-law. She feels that she is in love with her majestic Ho.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/yEGqQjNAIt9wnXQ3hJde48Oex6j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daeyoung Films Co., Ltd","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What will we become and where will we meet again?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4236682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu Jeong-hui","original_name":"유정희","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64eaef031feac100c46f48cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4236684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Yun-taek","original_name":"Kim Yun-taek","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64eaf05583901801021d534b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2264478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hong Pa","original_name":"홍파","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/it1pk2ZKooqnTvmXcVNX52pfoom.jpg","credit_id":"64eaf0b94581990100992996","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2264478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hong Pa","original_name":"홍파","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/it1pk2ZKooqnTvmXcVNX52pfoom.jpg","credit_id":"64eaf097839018013cdb1d85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/yEGqQjNAIt9wnXQ3hJde48Oex6j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
