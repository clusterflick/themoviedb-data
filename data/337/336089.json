Including that of Athanasius Kircher, inventor of the Magic Lantern or \"Sorcererâ€™s Lamp\". The music, La lutte des Mages (The Struggle of the Magicians), was composed by Armenian mystic Georges Gurdjieff and Thomas De Hartmann. Gurdjieff thought of man as a kind of \"transmitting station of forces.\" To him, most people move around in a state of waking sleep, so he sought to provide aural conditions that would induce awareness.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/2zZwEkUNScoRHKVUDX6WCCZcRRV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magician's House","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Stratman","original_name":"Deborah Stratman","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/5HV0VtAEaC6h8hyNNk8SFGgH1Ze.jpg","credit_id":"552fd67892514136ed002fef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3430066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2zZwEkUNScoRHKVUDX6WCCZcRRV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
