The concerto is appealing in its melodic material and the intricate interactions among the soloists and orchestra. The Choral Fantasy features a long piano solo that Beethoven wrote for himself, plus a choral melody that sounds like a preliminary sketch for the last movement of his Ninth Symphony. Both works pose unusual balance challenges, to which Barenboim and the recording engineers rise impressively.","popularity":0.2469,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3633,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI Records Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":51474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brilliant Media Gmbh","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven - Choral Fantasy and Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello & Piano","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (pianist and conductor)","credit_id":"5532565b9251417ae30008ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itzhak Perlman","original_name":"Itzhak Perlman","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/yELJweqEW6lzEIKlZJNQbEZprD8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (violinist)","credit_id":"5532566fc3a3682226002b17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yo-Yo Ma","original_name":"Yo-Yo Ma","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/3qa5GTwmV99kZLLNvKom4CHCnyO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (cellist)","credit_id":"55325686c3a3682223002996","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6020bfbaa22d3e003cb642fb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barrie Gavin","original_name":"Barrie Gavin","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/vd9FnvkRUcz5HXY13kX6eLCuajv.jpg","credit_id":"5532577f925141529100294f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1692481","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
