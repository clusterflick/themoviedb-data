And they defend their clientele, especially since their very existence is at risk. The safety precautions in safes and in banks are becoming ever stricter, making the working conditions for burglars and thieving magpies more and more difficult. Therefore, the interest group of property reducers - VDEI for short - made representations to the responsible minister and confronted him with a warning strike, which is intended to make it clear what economic function thieves and burglars have in society. The strike calls everyone involved in property security onto the scene: burglars and interest groups for guns, guard dog breeders and tank crackers gather. After heated discussions, an agreement can finally be reached - but the consumer has to pay for it.","popularity":0.1756,"poster_path":"/ystRHnDF3y9o8TUXLsadauqZfTG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 Percent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zehn Prozent","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Schwarzkopf","original_name":"Klaus Schwarzkopf","popularity":0.1347,"profile_path":"/l0oj2F8JhiXNDNgnI8cTCrUMMrZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oberregierungsrat Frühwirth","credit_id":"55302b53c3a36856cd002de4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1180720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Dirichs","original_name":"Ursula Dirichs","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":"/vMW8TwNf1iLU4vI83NqUGiccGnW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frau Frühwirth","credit_id":"55302b6592514114e6001f61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Brockmann","original_name":"Jochen Brockmann","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/oa6qaCwm2iRWsbD3ajcS1QWtBTp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Der Minister","credit_id":"55302b74c3a368618e00c8da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schütte","original_name":"Peter Schütte","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Diplomkaufmann Graff","credit_id":"55302b84c3a36856cd002de8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Schafheitlin","original_name":"Franz Schafheitlin","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/waBnCjhX3M73pKaKDJFRyM7wKKN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herr Bluhm","credit_id":"55302bbbc3a3681c41001974","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Jansen","original_name":"Wolfgang Jansen","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herr Schiller","credit_id":"55302bc9c3a368595100349f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Semmelrogge","original_name":"Willy Semmelrogge","popularity":0.374,"profile_path":"/q8Yxj1aGBfoiq04A9uNJCtfXe9D.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Herr Flick","credit_id":"55302bd99251415b2d00035a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1318843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaby Gasser","original_name":"Gaby Gasser","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Erste Sekretärin","credit_id":"5a974b00c3a36861510070dd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaspar von Oertzen","original_name":"Jaspar von Oertzen","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/29WHFRdsx9wMSTqDaknZ7sIJFhw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"von Normann","credit_id":"5a974b1892514128aa006cf9","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Mezger","original_name":"Theo Mezger","popularity":0.0908,"profile_path":"/t310DAzUHnuSoePZifvImr5LO0y.jpg","credit_id":"55302b35c3a368187e0010e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0354238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":994,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ystRHnDF3y9o8TUXLsadauqZfTG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
