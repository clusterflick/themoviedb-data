Opening in the streets of downtown Manhattan, Elliott (23), living at home after college, is surrounded by incomplete projects, frustrated and in search of purpose. Simultaneously, in New Orleans, Leanne (26), an aspiring model/actress and single mother of four, struggles to pick up the pieces, presenting at times a clash between family and her ambitious career. Plagued by an unforgiving criminal record, Jermaine (22), a New Orleans native, shifts through his home town for what seems like a hopeless attempt at legal employment. After a series of rejections, he resolves to reinvent himself in hopes of successfully starting anew.","popularity":0.2247,"poster_path":"/rB4ekuL5gEZTIEzHeX4UaDidTDr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Below Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Ehlers","original_name":"Elliott Ehlers","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Elliot","credit_id":"5536a0ff92514166aa003b00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamaine Johnson","original_name":"Jamaine Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jamaine","credit_id":"5536a11092514142b2003345","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Matalon","original_name":"Rebecca Matalon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rebecca","credit_id":"5536a11fc3a36842ae00177b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leanne Miller","original_name":"Leanne Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Leanne","credit_id":"5536a12e9251414201000e00","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dottie Youmans","original_name":"Dottie Youmans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61faa6bcfe6c182eb87a0b1f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garrett Bradley","original_name":"Garrett Bradley","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/wKN0uYfaFX4rjNfuIbgnyOlXMzo.jpg","credit_id":"5536a0e19251415704000520","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garrett Bradley","original_name":"Garrett Bradley","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/wKN0uYfaFX4rjNfuIbgnyOlXMzo.jpg","credit_id":"5536a0ec9251414201000dfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garrett Bradley","original_name":"Garrett Bradley","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/wKN0uYfaFX4rjNfuIbgnyOlXMzo.jpg","credit_id":"61faa5145c324700dda92a10","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959353,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Stekert","original_name":"David Stekert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faa520eee18600911a9732","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Vogelman","original_name":"Andrew Vogelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faa52a9e40120044d9adf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1448564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milena Pastreich","original_name":"Milena Pastreich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61faa538eee1860044e2524f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543473,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian C.
