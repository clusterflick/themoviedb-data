Through a theatrical reenactment of the painting's pictorial tableau and a re-articulation of its complex perspectival structure, Downey brings to life the spatial dynamics, illustrating the psychological tension of the relationship between viewer and subject. Placing Las Meninas in a historical context, Downey relates the painting's thematics to Spain's economic and political systems of the late 17th century.","popularity":0.0693,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maids of Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Beuchat","original_name":"Carmen Beuchat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5531a015c3a3682217000cbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Harris","original_name":"Suzanne Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5531a02ec3a3682226000e24","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Downey","original_name":"Juan Downey","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55319fbdc3a368221f000cfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1455810,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elaine Summers","original_name":"Elaine Summers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wK2CnNyHeDRnmYYQqmF6tVUGvB2.jpg","credit_id":"5531a06cc3a368221d000d03","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377183,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Foucault","original_name":"Michel Foucault","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/ut4VLdlcxOxyoSOZmUIaldzSCAi.jpg","credit_id":"5531a0b9925141528c000ca4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Kubler","original_name":"George Kubler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5531a0cc925141528f000d1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Downey","original_name":"Juan Downey","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5531a0df925141528f000d22","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
