He reports that his father intends to fatten him up during his vacation, to have him ready to return in the fall to finish his training for the priesthood. He mentions in passing that his father is courting a twenty-year-old, attractive widow, Pepita Jiménez; his father is fifty-five years old. Pepita had been married for only a short time to an eighty-year-old moneylender named Gumersindo. Luis is not eager to see his father marry again, but he promises his uncle not to judge Pepita before he knows her.","popularity":0.9535,"poster_path":"/eifymp1ftvh9D4N8SWKfh3soxnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Águila
