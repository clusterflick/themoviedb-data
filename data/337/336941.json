This video is about what it feels like to leave a  place in which one has spent more time than any other place, and which was also  the place of my family life. I am somewhere else now. Itâ€™s about beginning of growing roots in a new place, new home, with new friends, new thoughts, experiences.  This video is also about video. When in 1949 I began filming with my Bolex, it  took me fifteen years to really master it so that my Bolex would do for me what I  wanted. When in 1987 I got my first Sony camera I thought it would be different.  But no. Only today, after working with the video camera for fifteen years, I feel like it had become an extension of my eye, my body, \"A Letter from Greenpoint\" being my first real video work.","popularity":0.0961,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthology Film Archives","origin_country":""},{"id":1158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Streams Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter from Greenpoint","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mekas","credit_id":"5cc48d0b0e0a265b0ff4ce45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":561028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benn Northover","original_name":"Benn Northover","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Benn","credit_id":"5cc48d179251415cd2f74561","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","credit_id":"5537db0e9251416518006c14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","credit_id":"5cc48cdf0e0a2678a0ebb792","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","credit_id":"5cc48ce6c3a3681e6b83da6c","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1099974","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
