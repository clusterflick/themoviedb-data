Following the possibly real-life exploits of Josh Kornbluth, an autobiographical monologist, Love &amp; Taxes is a comedy that blends solo performance and scripted scenes to bring the subjective reality of the storyteller hilariously to life. A tale of procrastination, making movies and growing up, Love &amp; Taxes is a middle-aged coming-of-age story that is also, quite possibly, the first ever pro-tax romantic comedy.","popularity":1.0631,"poster_path":"/kJwYUePVOA503HXMpa2Y4XHCGJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95417,"logo_path":"/Q9YTXIe2ZGjWa1Ors6sqOpGrWp.png","name":"Abramorama","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love & Taxes","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Kornbluth","original_name":"Josh Kornbluth","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/kZZWKqlGsMG4rbnfcxaZelHTsMg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Josh Kornbluth","credit_id":"58c63b77c3a36840f6010c74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Overman","original_name":"Sarah Overman","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"58c63b8ac3a368412801099d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Shumaker","original_name":"Helen Shumaker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mo Glass","credit_id":"58c63b979251411d15012a36","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1775566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Keith","original_name":"Warren Keith","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/asyt7WkHjJLkZ8eAjPmQn35Fmye.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bob Shelby","credit_id":"6570a9060bb076011b81f6ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Sicular","original_name":"Robert Sicular","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Paul Kornbluth","credit_id":"58c63bb1c3a36840b8011f92","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Pelczar","original_name":"Nicholas Pelczar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"David Fuchs","credit_id":"58c63bc4c3a36841280109dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Shearer","original_name":"Harry Shearer","popularity":0.6304,"profile_path":"/7PnGZGVKJNDTUv3DkbaMEnCseT0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sean Boykin/Agent","credit_id":"58c63bd19251411d300126ef","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Reich","original_name":"Robert Reich","popularity":0.2262,"profile_path":"/f9Pbe4ULNEzrKeNZKn2GWJZ4mE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sheldon S.
