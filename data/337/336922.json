Here, hundreds of thousands of children are raising children and are left to fend for themselves in a cruel and frightening world. This is not a fairy tale. This kingdom is Swaziland, Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy. It has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the world, leaving 1/3 of its population orphaned or vulnerable. Without radical intervention to this preventable disease, there will be NO ADULTS in Swaziland by the year 2030. NEVER A NEVERLAND documents the reality of a kingdom moving towards extinction and the hope of a people working to ensure that Swaziland never becomes a 'Neverland'.","popularity":0.1111,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SZ","name":"Swaziland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never A Neverland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricky Norris","original_name":"Ricky Norris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"558d20a09251411902000185","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1790788","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9766,"name":"hiv"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
