It displays impressionistic street spectacle and images of quotidian life, as well as excursions by train and ship, unfolding as a private visual journal and a sort of souvenir, but with refined framing, camera movement, and rhythmic editing. With his own perspective and artistic sensitivity embedded in this film, struggling between being a Japanese colonial subject and a Taiwanese/Chinese litterateur, Liu attempts to transcend geological, national, racial/ethnic, linguistic and medial boundaries, to establish a depoliticized, internationalist, cosmopolitan cinematic utopia, a pure cinema, and a fluid and contested identity.","popularity":0.1123,"poster_path":"/4vBsIkJxBWkHdNNEUgeWwcDt4nX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1933-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Has a Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"Man with a Camera","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Chi sheyingji de nanren","type":"romanization"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"持摄影机的男人","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liu Na'ou","original_name":"Liu Na'ou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5538125d9251414be9000190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1155,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4vBsIkJxBWkHdNNEUgeWwcDt4nX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":769}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
