His job is to rid the pools of foreclosed homes of unwanted pests. On the road through this isolated region, he reflects on alternative ways of living and finds himself in his own solitude. CALIFORNIA CITY is a hybrid film which fluidly crosses the borders between fiction, documentary and essay. The form reflects the narrator's state of mind through feature film elements and an impressionistic use of images, photos and narration.","popularity":0.1193,"poster_path":"/6YkFihkevSIhBnl7OBENVU7EN7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"California City","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Lewis","original_name":"Jay Lewis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57ee12b2c3a3682aa100175b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bastian G端nther","original_name":"Bastian G端nther","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/y7PTdgnOiu1SpEUHbHKfoeFJuCI.jpg","credit_id":"553112e69251410663000069","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296752,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Kotschi","original_name":"Michael Kotschi","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ee1099c3a3684e32002f2a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bastian G端nther","original_name":"Bastian G端nther","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/y7PTdgnOiu1SpEUHbHKfoeFJuCI.jpg","credit_id":"57ee108cc3a3684e1e002dc1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10234,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Fabini","original_name":"Anne Fabini","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ee10a5c3a3682a650013c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3815248","wikidata_id":"Q20751867","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1399,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Ps3S6qhNTm9AcArhH3rBFEoWte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2487}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6YkFihkevSIhBnl7OBENVU7EN7a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
