Superman directs these lines to Kandor, the bell jar city that represents his own traumatic past, for he is the only surviving member of a planet that has been destroyed. Kandor now sits, frozen in time, a perpetual reminder of his inability to escape that past, and his alienated relationship to his present world. For us, Kandor is an image of a time that never was â€” the utopian city of the future that never came to be.","popularity":0.1064,"poster_path":"/m9q6FBZ83B016yQPAZXjq97vqAN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Superman Recites Selections from 'The Bell Jar' and Other Works by Sylvia Plath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Garvey","original_name":"Michael Garvey","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/eZoWourYVk79JpPx4l9yaIse8gs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Superman","credit_id":"6802a67cb13410cdc7991d75","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kelley","original_name":"Mike Kelley","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/uiQ9hpKNY5M3Hq68X4TyDSOUcEe.jpg","credit_id":"5becdbacc3a36812fa00a8fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380733,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Greg Kucera","original_name":"Greg Kucera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802a6a165c00a25a5d959de","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380739,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dave Hughes","original_name":"Dave Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802a6fb2368b12b179929db","department":"Crew","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380741,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Catherine Sullivan","original_name":"Catherine Sullivan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802a70cb13410cdc7991db2","department":"Crew","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380742,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Won Ju Lim","original_name":"Won Ju Lim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802a718e4753425efad4958","department":"Crew","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380733,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Greg Kucera","original_name":"Greg Kucera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802a7325570cba9e1acf620","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380733,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Greg Kucera","original_name":"Greg Kucera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802a73e5570cba9e1acf623","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521848,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sylvia Plath","original_name":"Sylvia Plath","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/9wumDOdUQFtLSsrrtvucURcLv77.jpg","credit_id":"6802a7a5b13410cdc7991de6","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42UdlFftI2B50Zdbj1Og6pZRa2T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7XLxaP0K86Ul74dNG2HFAJm29nd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m9q6FBZ83B016yQPAZXjq97vqAN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
