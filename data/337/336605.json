Desperate, but keenly aware of the answer's potential effect on the public, the programmer strikes a deal with his interrogators, agreeing to re-design the software in exchange for his freedom. As they search to understand why the program answered an ethical question and try to find a way to change its response, the faith and patience of both the programmer and his captors are put to the test. Suspenseful and darkly comic, S.E.R.P. is a film about coercion, innovation, and whether it is possible to do something good in the service of something evil.","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":"/r1dEW4dKfo4k0bmG1uZaVtAW8bu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Even digital revolutions require sacrifice","title":"S.E.R.P.","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Balunis","original_name":"Mark Balunis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Murdock","credit_id":"5534aef4c3a3680bdc001827","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Sean Campbell","original_name":"Robert Sean Campbell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Webster (as Robert Sean Campbell)","credit_id":"5534af01c3a368523e002f82","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Schwab","original_name":"Mark Schwab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553471c1925141675e000fb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2626833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bennett Fisher","original_name":"Bennett Fisher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb1bd580e597b001c623bb2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2505366","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dX3zcR0AyYYiWVD4DnoGXDWBLN7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r1dEW4dKfo4k0bmG1uZaVtAW8bu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
