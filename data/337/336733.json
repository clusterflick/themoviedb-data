The film is based on 'the life and dreams' of Nini Sardlishvili, a sixteen-year-old Georgian girl. Nini tells about her life and dreams, speaks with two elderly women about past and future and walks among the ruins of a huge, burnt-out Soviet archive. She plays herself in the film, just like the other protagonist, Domestic Intelligence agent Gocha Ovashvili. He travels across the country in response to a remarkable appeal by a Georgian minister (appearing in a newscast), to ask people if they are criminals. During this futile and absurd quest, he meets mainly aged Georgians, including a shepherd and two monks, and admires the scenery.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geen Dank Produkties","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Light Behaves Differently Towards Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nini Sardlishvili","original_name":"Nini Sardlishvili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"553564a6c3a368523e004033","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gocha Ovashvili","original_name":"Gocha Ovashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"553564afc3a36848ca006e57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vako Karchkadze","original_name":"Vako Karchkadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"553564ba9251416f880030ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dodo Chichinadze","original_name":"დოდო ჭიჭინაძე","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/21aSZjSTzoKSqycrYW02euQlCJt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"553564c4925141675e002615","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Kokaeva","original_name":"Lara Kokaeva","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"553564ce925141675e002618","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Khumsishvili","original_name":"David Khumsishvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"553564d99251417eb8002089","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296155,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stella Van Voorst van Beest","original_name":"Stella Van Voorst van Beest","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5535651c9251417eb8002095","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457174,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Willem van Dam","original_name":"Jan Willem van Dam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5535652bc3a36852de0041a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457174,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Willem van Dam","original_name":"Jan Willem van Dam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553564e792514125dc0042d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
