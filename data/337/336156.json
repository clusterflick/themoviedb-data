And almost two years later, the families and the nation are left with few answers. In spite of a massive international investigative effort and a plenitude of theories, there is still no conclusive explanation of what happened to these 43 young men, raising the chilling possibility that the mystery of the students’ disappearance will never be solved. A Day in Ayotzinapa 43 is not a recount of the events, but an intimate foray into a community under siege, as it serves as the symbolic epicentre of a political tension that has erupted at all levels.","popularity":0.1114,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2015-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day in Ayotzinapa 43","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cinerio García","original_name":"Cinerio García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"553051c2c3a368411b0002f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1455198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minerva Sánchez","original_name":"Minerva Sánchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"553051ca92514150b5000305","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucía López Santiago","original_name":"Lucía López Santiago","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"553051d392514150a3000333","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel de la Cruz López","original_name":"Daniel de la Cruz López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"553051dd92514150a5000314","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hernández","original_name":"David Hernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"553051e5c3a3680a940000e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Guerrero Cano","original_name":"Ernesto Guerrero Cano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"553051eb92514150b100035a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310919,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rafael Rangel","original_name":"Rafael Rangel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55304fc792514150b80002d8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310919,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rafael Rangel","original_name":"Rafael Rangel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55304fbac3a3684125000311","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661667,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ernesto Flores","original_name":"Ernesto Flores","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a3b943c3a368551a000d6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661666,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"León Nik","original_name":"León Nik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a3b932c3a36854c2001012","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Un día en Ayotzinapa 43 TRAILER","key":"cGS2CAsD1ME","published_at":"2014-11-29T21:39:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"578e9cecc3a3685acb0155c2"}]}}}
