The film weaves together an ambitious UFO investigation with a personal story that gives a rare insight into the hearts and minds of a UFO-investigator.  Every year, the organization UFO‐Sweden receives numerous reports about inexplicable occurrences ‐ usually dismissed as having to do with the moon, airplanes, satellites or mental instability on the part of the witness. Sometimes, though, they get a report that they are unable to explain, one of them being the story of the ghost rocket.","popularity":0.3703,"poster_path":"/ktafk3VPyH2OfSNS2KPUtJdOCd3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51653,"logo_path":null,"name":"We Have a Plan","origin_country":""},{"id":51654,"logo_path":"/qTkVCfQFiM0q9sYn9pXKOsZdH2B.png","name":"Momento Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Greatest Mystery Never Told","title":"Ghost Rockets","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clas Svahn","original_name":"Clas Svahn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55356d7d92514166aa000565","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Cavanagh","original_name":"Michael Cavanagh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55356b4392514125dc004344","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Übelacker","original_name":"Kerstin Übelacker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55356b52c3a3682dc2002a42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299845,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Herdies","original_name":"David Herdies","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55356b72c3a36834430022f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Übelacker","original_name":"Kerstin Übelacker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55356b9bc3a36848ca006ec4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Cavanagh","original_name":"Michael Cavanagh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ddf5b392514134f7000339","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Übelacker","original_name":"Kerstin Übelacker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ddf5cd92514135010002fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4301242","wikidata_id":"Q23991082","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":898,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sj19hdh3Kb1BCaccaQniXENOmEX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktafk3VPyH2OfSNS2KPUtJdOCd3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":1192,"name":"sweden"},{"id":9951,"name":"alien"},{"id":9738,"name":"ufo"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"Göteborg International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"UFO Documentary - Ghost Rockets Teaser #1","key":"0slQwdHE5w4","published_at":"2012-07-05T11:32:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"553569c692514147160006d0"}]}}}
