Some of the footage was originally broadcast on The Old Grey Whistle Test. The performance was available for many years as a bootleg before former Yes manager Brian Lane co-ordinated a 1993 2-volume VHS release and a Japanese two Laserdisc release without any input from the band. In 2001, the video was released on a two disc DVD set.  Recorded at Loftus Road Stadium, London, home of Queens Park Rangers Football Club (known as Q.P.R.) on 10-May-1975.
