Although reluctant to do so, island recluse Tess (Mirjana Jokovic) offers her home to Sam (David Thornton) and Nigel (Tomas Arana), a pair of tuxedo-suited (and blood-soaked) strangers who arrive via motorboat with an exotic animal in tow. Allowing them to heal their wounds but desperate to get them out of her home, Tess immediately hides her valuables and frequently makes for the cellar where she appears to speak with an unseen housemate.","popularity":0.4925,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chiaroscuro Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Property","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Island of the Damned","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirjana Joković","original_name":"Mirjana Joković","popularity":0.322,"profile_path":"/x7FJaCev5abs2kq1XgS01Ei6mX2.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Tess","credit_id":"5530ea0392514150a3001b62","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Thornton","original_name":"David Thornton","popularity":0.6067,"profile_path":"/jKlG3icyzBrpOqPoimRmENf3tPf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5530ea0d92514150a5001b51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Arana","original_name":"Tomas Arana","popularity":0.5319,"profile_path":"/qMuQWxUQ2sXDiN2d9EDVT5VXHo2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nigel","credit_id":"5530ea1ec3a3684112001c1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Parent","original_name":"Richard Parent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cricket","credit_id":"5530ea3dc3a3684112001c24","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Amore","original_name":"Bobby Amore","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"5530ea49c3a368411b00199b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324793,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Persefone Karakosta","original_name":"Persefone Karakosta","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e969e5aadc4136469070b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Hairstylist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548226,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Robotham","original_name":"Tom Robotham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e9690cee48100665be0d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324793,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Persefone Karakosta","original_name":"Persefone Karakosta","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e9699c92c5d0052ddfc02","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Dimon","original_name":"Elizabeth Dimon","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e9679873f0000a9e265fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1439743,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Goran Pavicevic","original_name":"Goran Pavicevic","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e9689fd140b00acc3b219","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Dimon","original_name":"Elizabeth Dimon","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5530ea57c3a3684117001a64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0310022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
