When his beloved, doting granddaughter Annie plans to marry Deniz, an ambitious student and waiter in Ankara who needs a visa for Germany, backward Paul and his buddy, publican Karin, go on Turkish 'holiday' so he can talk her out of it. But Deniz proves her only choice and probably a right one, even if countrymen and family win Paul's heart, as well as a resourceful preteen-thief, who proves an orphaned Syrian refugee. Paul even promises to plead with his counterpart, Deniz's family patriarch, who opposes him marrying a Christian infidel at pain of expulsion from the close clan.","popularity":0.5189,"poster_path":"/qhu5ipUTA6pj3UXK51f6zhXWc0z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51311,"logo_path":null,"name":"Provobis Gesellschaft für Film und
