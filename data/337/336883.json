These musicians tell their stories, influences, creative process, challenges they face, and how they sell music in the era of Internet downloads. While the music’s international, cross-cultural appeal receives due coverage, the Eastern United States and the Baltimore-Philadelphia region, specifically, are acknowledged as the cradle of prog’s post-1970s artistic renaissance.  This film is also about the passion and spirit of progressive music genre, its music, its festivals, and the ecosystem that supports it.
