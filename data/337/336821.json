A few years later, Bastien has become cynical and dark. He has a relationship based on voyeurism and sadomasochism with a woman called Sarah. One night, by continually pushing their experiences farther, the young woman is shocked and decides to distance herself from her lover. She then tries to get rid of him but he ends up losing his temper and imposing her the narrative of his hike with Elise. At first perplexed as for the intentions of the man who holds her back, Sarah is gradually overwhelmed with awe when the story falls into madness and Elise and Bastien, lost in the middle of nowhere have to face a threat that is bigger than their faltering romance","popularity":0.1888,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":259415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marty est une entreprise","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hostiles","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Mollé","original_name":"Ludovic Mollé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bastien","credit_id":"67fd22f2765c5222f399626c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Senot","original_name":"Helen Senot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elise","credit_id":"67fd230c7c29ae5bc3d95674","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1773504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Lucas","original_name":"Brigitte Lucas","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/nhapl6N0JvCZGtFFZPVRXBFijAM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"La mère","credit_id":"67fd23617c29ae5bc3d95687","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1745560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elise Diamant","original_name":"Elise Diamant","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jZ1V4078HNVSlBPdM7cKCOzrXaR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"67fd23a99d1f778ab8992205","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2490564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romain Deroo","original_name":"Romain Deroo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Le copain de l'agresseur","credit_id":"67fd245c9d1f778ab8992284","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoann Denaive","original_name":"Yoann Denaive","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/2mtZTv2mNxPISrNp7xRvjbpgewK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"L'agresseur","credit_id":"67fd24d5c1e0a708cbad245f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Coulangeon","original_name":"Marie Coulangeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"La copine de l'agresseur","credit_id":"67fd250c9d1f778ab899232d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romane Portail","original_name":"Romane Portail","popularity":0.2857,"profile_path":"/ohLR4DFKrLSQhOC9xaZBijdQo1f.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"La soeur","credit_id":"67fd2555765c5222f39962ba","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2267377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ravet","original_name":"David Ravet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mwuWTLfo8fK9JTIjbDWdXOYBXN0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"L'ami de la soeur","credit_id":"67fd25aa9d1f778ab8992355","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Mekkoui","original_name":"Victoria Mekkoui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"La serveuse","credit_id":"67fd25d37c29ae5bc3d957c3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1781395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Bariller","original_name":"Hugo Bariller","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/oTH1OhNMEgHt5MIBPIx2WCJ8rst.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Le chasseur (uncredited)","credit_id":"67fd264961b1c4bb32993634","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Plessy","original_name":"Robin Plessy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb3b2580e0a2626cec95ee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Plessy","original_name":"Robin Plessy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd22c6ef5ae687cbd91bcd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4243168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
