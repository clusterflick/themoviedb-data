But the Group A cars that followed provided their own surprises and in the 1990s, it all changed again as Group A evolved in the face of a restyled World Rally competition. We take a rare 'inside view' of the top rally cars of the early/mid Nineties - joining top teams in their workshops and testing; talking to drivers and team managers; and enjoying the culmination of their efforts with action footage from the international rally circuit. Featuring Mitsubishi, Subaru and Ford with McRae, Sainz, Erikkson, Makinen and Burns.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cutting Edge Rallying","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
