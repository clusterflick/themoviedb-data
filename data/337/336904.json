Streetcars share tree-lined streets with horse-drawn carriages; people conduct business under umbrella-covered markets and arcaded market halls; parks and schoolyards host sports, games and animated discussions. Scenes of the famous Remu Synagogue and the Alte Shul, an orphanage, a hospital, the Jewish Community Council, and several schools convey the vitality of this age-old Jewish community.","popularity":0.0797,"poster_path":"/fW4fLUVjChp65GDxk6B7OJvoLcy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1939-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kraków","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jewish Life in Kraków","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jewish Life in Cracow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Lerner","original_name":"Asher Lerner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"55379894c3a36878450034a4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yitzhak Goskind","original_name":"Yitzhak Goskind","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553799289251411fd0000276","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saul Goskind","original_name":"Saul Goskind","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5537991b92514140b1000908","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1062926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fW4fLUVjChp65GDxk6B7OJvoLcy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
