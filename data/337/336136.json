It is AWEsome to be human and to be alive, but the evolution of human intelligence has also burdened our species with a self-awareness of life’s impermanence. The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard called these two uniquely human emotions, awe and dread. Through its symbolic meditation on mortality, this work attempts to find meaning between the fleeting flavors of bubblegum and cultural programming that entrenches us in our denial of death.","popularity":0.333,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tommy Becker","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song for Awe & Dread","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Becker","original_name":"Tommy Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552fff22c3a3686be2006e86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Becker","original_name":"Tommy Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552fff2f9251413b3b004316","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Becker","original_name":"Tommy Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552ffefdc3a36859510030d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Becker","original_name":"Tommy Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552fff0dc3a36859510030d6","department":"Art","job":"Other"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212634,"name":"dread"},{"id":212635,"name":"awe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
