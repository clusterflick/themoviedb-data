I have broken apart the story and set it as a mechanical game with a series of repetitions where CINDERELLA is projected back and forth like a ping-pong ball between the hearth and the castle. She never succeeds in satisfying the requirements of the ‘Cinderella Game’. The film was shot MOS, the dialogue is lip-synched, and along with the out-front score and effects track magnifies the film’s sense of alienation.” — E.B. 1984  - Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2017.","popularity":0.3831,"poster_path":"/kJY0LBH0L6sdosPNHrFip3feZzw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":150333,"logo_path":"/yKlXYturdVaDpGZJUtG7taPdzRd.png","name":"Jerome Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigi Kalweit","original_name":"Gigi Kalweit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cinderella","credit_id":"5c31d25492514165a672227e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kelley","original_name":"Mike Kelley","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/uiQ9hpKNY5M3Hq68X4TyDSOUcEe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Accordian Player","credit_id":"5c31d2ec0e0a2611b83dcc39","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"552fcd929251413b3b003d56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"63b35e6e875d1a008202d889","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679688,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brooke Halpin","original_name":"Brooke Halpin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c31d1bb9251416d94713e14","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"5c31d1d7c3a3682919aad1f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"5c31d39c9251416451714d5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11454746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7qxlbReKT7wIJL6NM6OwNRadg70.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2096},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7jlS4GkGeohZe3Bp3nke5PfSIRa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2096},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mxQ7jLu8nKVYnj4MgOnscCBLojX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3meQM7b6lYOkPQUDSKmlxrpmT4H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1490},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9lM02w5L3TkpMHJil3cmPqQsKOH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTd874NhLDwkI03lKZQVV7oZjHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jeEjbydQmKgKXdpKTQXgslcJN9c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/idcmuWSvHdop0pEuJmPWN8Augf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2096}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1552,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJY0LBH0L6sdosPNHrFip3feZzw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1034}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ericka Beckman on Cinderella and You the Better | Projections at NYFF56","key":"By4FkGe0Law","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2019-01-14T18:54:09.000Z","id":"63b35ea7c56d2d0089b2b5c7"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cinderella excerpt for website","key":"145705692","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-11-14T05:05:14.000Z","id":"63b35ed4391b9c008b9fc137"}]}}}
