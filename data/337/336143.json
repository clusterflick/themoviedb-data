Against this backdrop, Japanese businessman Toshio Sugimoto (Yusuke Kawazu) enjoys a leisurely existence, buying seafood in the relatively safe climate of Saigon. After accidentally killing a Vietnamese, his entire existence falls apart. Suddenly stripped of all privileges — from no. 1 to no. 10 — as well as having to put order in his love affair with the beautiful club singer Lan (Lan Tanh) and falling into the Saigon underworld, one mistake at a time, Sugimoto goes into hiding. But soon, hiding isn’t enough. He must flee across a war-torn Vietnam, taking his lover Lan and newfound ally Taro (Kenji Isomura), son of an ex-Japanese soldier and a Vietnamese woman, along for the bumpy ride.","popularity":0.0863,"poster_path":"/akfg41a4Ti9RvUIxbPch0TFrT5J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Number 10 Blues Goodbye Saigon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2336990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norio Osada","original_name":"Norio Osada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d023b920e0a261fbbd15d7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3096178","wikidata_id":"Q17224179","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/akfg41a4Ti9RvUIxbPch0TFrT5J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8C5duvHWKg0bAUpAZNhgrccZg5B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Nippon Connection 2014","release_date":"2014-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
