The film calls forth the spirit of one who was larger than life as recounted by those who knew her. Teiji Ito's family, Carolee Schneemann and Judith Malvina, float through the homes recalling in tiny bits and pieces words of Deren's architectural and personal interior space. Clips from Maya Deren's films are projected back into the spaces where they were originally filmed appearing on the floorboard, furniture, and in the bowl of her former sink. Fluid light projections of intimate space provide an elusive agency for a filmmaker most of us will never know as film with its imaginary nature evokes a former time and space.","popularity":0.5545,"poster_path":"/rbcMscXzM7FZXQvq88MgOHX8zd4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maya Deren's Sink","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1457805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bekka Lindstrom","original_name":"Bekka Lindstrom","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maya Deren","credit_id":"5537a341c3a3681be40020b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bd5576a0e0a2622cc026df3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tavia Ito","original_name":"Tavia Ito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d122935925141076aba1f37","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Ryan","original_name":"Gail Ryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d122954c3a36809b22193e6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Deren","original_name":"Maya Deren","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/bRYjnP55cPK9RLVHbtUDq4kaIop.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Herself (archival footage)","credit_id":"66f97a27621e8616b45f7f27","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5537a370c3a36842ae004a43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephanie Testa","original_name":"Stephanie Testa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5537a3559251412d9100262c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5537a2e6c3a3681be40020a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5d1225fe9251417873b8d7ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephanie Testa","original_name":"Stephanie Testa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d12260f925141524dc0d3af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":995589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teiji Ito","original_name":"Teiji Ito","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/a7wegTWlAg96XgMx1vH5hd6aJi4.jpg","credit_id":"5d59a824dcf875001519ca51","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457803,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erin Harper","original_name":"Erin Harper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a5727fb3f61004b44acf4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"600a5720a4f03c003b160203","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1862049","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rbcMscXzM7FZXQvq88MgOHX8zd4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
