Four months later, history is about to repeat itself. The end of summer signals the brink of manhood for a group of lifelong friends who proudly call New Hampshire their home. But when they embark upon a local rite of passage - traveling north for one final weekend of debauchery together - it just might prove to be their final weekend PERIOD, as this rite is doomed to go frightfully wrong. When they find themselves ensnared in a struggle for survival amongst a sinister hunting party, a bloodthirsty tribe AND a mythical beast, what began as a comedy of errors devolves into an all-out Darwinian duel to the death, and less than 24 hours will pass before a slew of lives have been claimed and the last of the living remains.","popularity":0.524,"poster_path":"/bWLJsGMYCkVyawYCECrQ9N5LbNN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55489,"logo_path":null,"name":"GlueFactory Features","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death Is Not The Worst Of Evils","title":"American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayo Okeniyi","original_name":"Dayo Okeniyi","popularity":1.1441,"profile_path":"/8m4ZIuzVBDjFbJFLXebc4iwv27o.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Bro","credit_id":"557cb094c3a36863230025ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Rice","original_name":"Tyler Rice","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/8dUNxprBeep7BDCvJdhT4lI7tHj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dude-Guy","credit_id":"557cb0aec3a3682e280002ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Thomas","original_name":"Shawn Thomas","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Buddy","credit_id":"557cb0c1c3a3686323002605","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Isabella","original_name":"Jeremy Isabella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kid","credit_id":"557cb0ef92514153a10024b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flood Reed","original_name":"Flood Reed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bags","credit_id":"557cb0f8c3a368631d00234d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Hish","original_name":"Matt Hish","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Officer Girth","credit_id":"557cb1069251410414000884","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flood Reed","original_name":"Flood Reed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7514dbd40d4c00396d6c31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flood Reed","original_name":"Flood Reed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7514fad40d4c003a626672","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1778906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bWLJsGMYCkVyawYCECrQ9N5LbNN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":570,"name":"rape"},{"id":6018,"name":"new hampshire"},{"id":9720,"name":"woods"},{"id":12339,"name":"slasher"},{"id":14559,"name":"hillbilly"},{"id":33688,"name":"hunting"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":41393,"name":"new england"},{"id":207942,"name":"icelandic"},{"id":215033,"name":"flood reed"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"American Backwoods: SLEW HAMPSHIRE\" - Official Full-Length Trailer","key":"6YE9pRK6WBk","published_at":"2015-04-21T08:47:02.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"557cb1b9c3a368765a000814"}]}}}
