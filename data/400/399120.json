From Selma and Birmingham and Atlanta; to the battleground beaches of St. Augustine, Florida, with Chinua Achebe; and back north for a visit to Newark with Amiri Baraka, Baldwin lays bare the fiction of progress in post–Civil Rights America, wondering “what happened to the children” and those 'who did not die, but whose lives were smashed on Freedom Road'.","popularity":0.5276,"poster_path":"/lJCNvyh2xuJy0a5rQFTTCsuzPEB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Living Archives
