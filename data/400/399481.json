Sampling NASA footage and remixing it to original beats, this DVD project brings together cutting-edge VJs, DJs, visual artists, and music producers to create 26 unique audiovisual tracks.  Laying down the AV vibe alongside Addictive TV are pioneering artists like Coldcut and EBN's Brian Kane. With its tripped up fusion of archive images and inspired new tunes, Spaced Out is an alternative space odyssey; deep chilled audiovisual electronica for the new century. Forty years of space exploration remixed for the 21st Century.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pzd7g0JAeKiaWQjCtS2ybImPFz1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonshine Movies Presents AV:X.02 - Spaced Out","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pzd7g0JAeKiaWQjCtS2ybImPFz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2002-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
