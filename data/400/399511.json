As he points out, Schubert can’t have known that he was soon to die, so they probably do not embody the air of resignation and finality future generations have sentimentally insisted they bear. They were however long neglected, all but forgotten, and only in more recent times have they come to be treasured and performed. The repose and wisdom of the maestro, together with the patient observation of one who is no stranger to the idea of the irrevocably lost, of the erasures of history, and of the value of fragile objects passed carefully from generation to generation, is a joy.","popularity":0.091,"poster_path":"/aqjlxuHEtICOev0KDy0gKOQQ2w4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mallia Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":93134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre Pompidou","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Franz Schubert's Last Three Piano Sonatas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1676946,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sonia Wieder-Atherton","original_name":"Sonia Wieder-Atherton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6450cbb093bd6900e5fe54dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Brendel","original_name":"Alfred Brendel","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":"/21boKVBWKpLnlm8D82BFSbotO2d.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fc63bd6d132d600411e01ec","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","credit_id":"574813bf9251415f4100173a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Joly","original_name":"Nicolas Joly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641033d8c390c500796f5e34","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628196,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rose Legrand","original_name":"Rose Legrand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641033e7323eba010b91b9c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1554983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rémon Fromont","original_name":"Rémon Fromont","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641033cac390c500796f5e26","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098515","wikidata_id":"Q24905467","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aqjlxuHEtICOev0KDy0gKOQQ2w4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1497},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYLSZTEuvTG7cCOE29YHJYDNadn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
