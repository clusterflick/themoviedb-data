His parents aren’t around. The garden is all theirs. They can make love there. A photograph hangs on the wall of a man with a tiger in his arms. “Is that your father?” asks Anäis. “Yes, that’s my father. He’s the chairman of a tiger protection group in Thailand.” The father is Pierre Woodman, the famous pornographic film director. Lucas enters into an imaginary dialogue with his father. He makes an attempt to understand his father and makes an attempt at love himself – always in view of his father, who practised it incessantly.Then Lucas confers Anäis with a knighthood and fiction soars above reality.","popularity":0.118,"poster_path":"/fBSPONFznNH3iOdHLgWH3IJgM3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34935,"logo_path":"/4JDPygYD7c8ZKXyD5zj9U1j3IvM.png","name":"La Fémis","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1604667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah-Megan Allouch","original_name":"Sarah-Megan Allouch","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57cc7e2dc3a36872eb001545","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674641,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Doméjean","original_name":"Lucas Doméjean","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57cc7e509251412622003285","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Poggi","original_name":"Caroline Poggi","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/moocgvSZRNGrbi2buV7EbCt5R9x.jpg","credit_id":"6179389be323f30045b59e67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Vinel","original_name":"Jonathan Vinel","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/aDrdmZgW2f6LKqNpwEP6P692NbA.jpg","credit_id":"57cc7e18c3a368309c003204","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Poggi","original_name":"Caroline Poggi","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/moocgvSZRNGrbi2buV7EbCt5R9x.jpg","credit_id":"5d5bd61960c75100148e0562","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2391564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lou Chicoteau","original_name":"Lou Chicoteau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5bd6092495ab00153089c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Vinel","original_name":"Jonathan Vinel","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/aDrdmZgW2f6LKqNpwEP6P692NbA.jpg","credit_id":"5d5bd62909191b00141d8f91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Gaudet","original_name":"Mathieu Gaudet","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdb3610798e06004032ac3a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Vinel","original_name":"Jonathan Vinel","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/aDrdmZgW2f6LKqNpwEP6P692NbA.jpg","credit_id":"5fdb361b0d5d85003f30003b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4843072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2lf0nLb3WgP8i09O7UFBVeK6V1U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fBSPONFznNH3iOdHLgWH3IJgM3l.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7G93JTHFUgmn6gofFyoRx7CbjcE.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
