My film pictures learning blocks as relay races conducted by male players, where the girls are scores, and the goal is to enter the working world by the end of the game. Mike Kelley, the lead player in my film, makes a ritual out of his mistakes to escape the consequences of his mistakes. In this film, one person’s work is another person’s play, and play creates competition, a component of work.” — E.B. 1979","popularity":0.0864,"poster_path":"/zyPuKEuaGEglrn9B2SobRHCmiHH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Broken Rule","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kelley","original_name":"Mike Kelley","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/uiQ9hpKNY5M3Hq68X4TyDSOUcEe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60502a07871b3400742e8761","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Mullican","original_name":"Matt Mullican","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60502a2a22e4800028b108db","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"574650ff9251415f6000084d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zyPuKEuaGEglrn9B2SobRHCmiHH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
