Nearby, people sit in a crowded restaurant. Detached from those around them, they eat, mumble and fantasize without any passion or engagement. A waitress apathetic recites the specials. Two men literally pass through each other near the toilets. These people have shelter and food, but they aren't alive. The restaurant almost becomes a security blanket, a place to hide from their crazy, mundane and trapped existence. The mad street preacher is a lone voice of conviction and delusion.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beholder","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Sullivan","original_name":"Chris Sullivan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5746c6929251415f60001d6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
