The camera approached this collective psychodramatic ritual in an attempt to 'reinvent' the history of vision, the biological evolution of the eye, which, emerging from the primordial waters as from amniotic ones, gazes upon the land; reliving with the actors the evolution that the species has undergone, and attempting to make visible how the past of our animal ancestors (what Ferenczi called onto-phylogenesis) is present in our dreams and everyday behaviors.\" (A.
