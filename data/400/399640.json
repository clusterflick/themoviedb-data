The Inuits are indigenous tribes who come from the northern territories of Canada. The word “inuit” means “the people” in the Inuktitut language. It is commonly believed that homosexuality does not exist in Inuit society, or is a choice, but documentary filmmakers Mark Kenneth Woods and Michael Yerxa aim to prove this untrue in their documentary, Two Soft Things, Two Hard Things. The title for the film comes from the Inuit word for homosexuals. The word for lesbians translates to “two soft things rubbing against each other” and the word for gay men means “two hard things rubbing against each other.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2U2MdNIkpofoDeTdvcPg3X80pFB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Soft Things, Two Hard Things","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kenneth Woods","original_name":"Mark Kenneth Woods","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/qCoHiPBFRTUzstKycpoR4ryXLxk.jpg","credit_id":"5748b574c3a368665e0001eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1627134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Yerxa","original_name":"Michael Yerxa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5748b588925141373f0002ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5503490","wikidata_id":"Q24192020","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3a5VPyqargK1rrNdQD3ZhFlf7H5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2U2MdNIkpofoDeTdvcPg3X80pFB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
