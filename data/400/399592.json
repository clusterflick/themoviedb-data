Now, as the harmonic horrors attempt to reunite and bring about the end of the world, can a cop, a hooker, and a warrior from the past defeat these evil spirits before the music stops… forever?  A combination of paean and parody, the music-filled INSTRUMENTS OF EVIL pays homage to the low-budget exploitation (or “grindhouse”) films of the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, while also poking fun at their notorious excesses and absurdities. Fans of low-budget, B-movie madness will find enjoyment here, but be warned: not only tunes get stuck in your head!","popularity":0.4041,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80480,"logo_path":null,"name":"EYECATCHER Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not Only Tunes Get Stuck In Your Head!","title":"Instruments of Evil","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Belhumeur","original_name":"Rich Belhumeur","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Sgt.
