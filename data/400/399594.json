Born in the Bronx to Orthodox Jewish émigrés from Poland, Applebroog, now in her 80s, looks back at how she expressed herself through decades of drawings and paintings, as well as her private journals. With her daughter’s encouragement, she investigates the stranger that is her former self, a woman who found psychological and sexual liberation through art. As Beth B finds a deeper understanding of her mother as a human being, Applebroog shares a newfound appreciation for her own provocative work.","popularity":0.1068,"poster_path":"/lwPQuA494ZoalPKlT7T1ntXUbp5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Her Applebroog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1175878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Applebroog","original_name":"Ida Applebroog","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57486db692514135cb002a81","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534633,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim Coleman","original_name":"Jim Coleman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57486dee925141545200146b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth B","original_name":"Beth B","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/wpauaENRWLniKF1R42x1eFHPjw5.jpg","credit_id":"57486dd4925141635600228b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth B","original_name":"Beth B","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/wpauaENRWLniKF1R42x1eFHPjw5.jpg","credit_id":"57486dc89251415f4100261b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth B","original_name":"Beth B","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/wpauaENRWLniKF1R42x1eFHPjw5.jpg","credit_id":"57486ddb92514135cb002a89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5615222","wikidata_id":"Q24631316","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lwPQuA494ZoalPKlT7T1ntXUbp5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
