It was installed at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia in 1991. A computer is swaddled in blankets in a small baby carriage. A text appears on the screen that tells the (true) story of a woman who miscarries and keeps the fetus in her refrigerator. The narration is artificial, generated by a speech synthesis program. This voice becomes more human as the story evolves and as our understanding of the power of naming sharpens.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/m2aXMH5EO2E1NucCG88nrVbUY36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genesis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Rose","original_name":"Peter Rose","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lwlkPk8RfTL8UtaX0JzwYJC72Pe.jpg","credit_id":"57455cbc92514153e50018ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3878712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2aXMH5EO2E1NucCG88nrVbUY36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
