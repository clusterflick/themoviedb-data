Most humans think in terms of \"uni-verse,\" or one reality. But what if, as many enlightened beings and physicists theorize, there are infinite realities, some so different they are almost beyond comprehension. These realities are intertwined into the ultimate reality, or Multiverse. The Multiverse DVD plunges you into a voyage to some of these other realities, as visualized by creator Danyel Seagan through his own astral travels. Imagination is the infinite multiverse. Use this DVD for meditation, relaxation, or as an ambient background experience.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Multiverse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1626564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danyel Seagan","original_name":"Danyel Seagan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5747b201c3a3686ba0000de1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
