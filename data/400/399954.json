Mathilde eats, trains and sleeps while Redon acts as her assistant. He is fascinated by her physical form and her discipline until he finds out that she is abusing her body. This completely changes the way he sees her: in his eyes, she is transformed from an admirable dancer into a dance-obsessed person with no mercy for her own body. When she starts to avoid him and no longer wants to cooperate with the film, Redon becomes obsessed with the issue that has become a taboo subject in their relationship.","popularity":0.0968,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In California","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Redon","original_name":"Charles Redon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574b02d69251412d29001269","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5135078","wikidata_id":"Q30969452","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
