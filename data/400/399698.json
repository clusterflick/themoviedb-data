Over a quiet dinner, he talks with Athrun, Shinn and other members of the crew. This conversation leads Shinn to reflect on the past, and the events that brought them to where they are now. But understanding does not bring peace, and after another argument with some of his shipmates, Shinn heads ashore to clear his head. There he meets a beautiful girl, and watches her fall into the ocean. He dives in to rescue her, and in turn then must wait to be rescued. Meanwhile, the Alliance Forces gather, along with their Orb Allies, to launch an attack on ZAFT. The Minerva scrambles and prepares for battle. But unknown to either side, far beneath the waves, another group is going to try to put an end to the fighting.","popularity":1.3765,"poster_path":"/pH2HAoHyi187H0PREXMZtqJ6sIZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3153,"logo_path":"/yKZ9UarLSu9Y4Gpw33nKRQOPM7z.png","name":"SUNRISE","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny TV Movie II: Their Respective Swords","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"機動戦士ガンダムSEED DESTINY スペシャルエディションII  それぞれの剣（つるぎ） HDリマスター","type":"HD Remaster version"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"기동전사 건담 시드 데스티니 스페셜 에디션 각자의 검","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"기동전사 건담 SEED Destiny 스페셜 에디션: 각자의 검","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"기동전사 건담 SEED DESTINY - SE02.각자의 검","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenichi Suzumura","original_name":"鈴村健一","popularity":0.9233,"profile_path":"/vFqjmIjxfgBkh3ZmUin7QETV0sy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shinn Asuka (voice)","credit_id":"5ec13c569979d200212fb49e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soichiro Hoshi","original_name":"保志総一朗","popularity":1.0427,"profile_path":"/kBULhALfWrkacAuX9KZHBx27nfJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kira Yamato (voice)","credit_id":"5ec13c6e28723c001f477658","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1247590,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chiaki Morosawa","original_name":"両澤千晶","popularity":0.2424,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfa7bbc9054f0187c4c720","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitsuo Fukuda","original_name":"福田己津央","popularity":0.1828,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b73462c92514103410bab23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshiyuki Tomino","original_name":"富野由悠季","popularity":0.6795,"profile_path":"/3I8gsOJ30GCd5g71NYbYXZeEybg.jpg","credit_id":"66d370f4d94dffd8f701d186","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4018421,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hajime Yatate","original_name":"矢立肇","popularity":0.2855,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d37109de9e844993c0dadb","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6531350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jVFWQMoWqFizXReT0UAfXB4B0XM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1086,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a9SEyoUf6cKArvF7rcCR9S0acBE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1931}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/pH2HAoHyi187H0PREXMZtqJ6sIZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/4R3zVOCccohru2SJHFehshvBR0h.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qU9P2R1KsAfO7DmbOWs2TuxWYES.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/t32ZxXDue78wmqwU3JDqsxsUKOw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/gJf0FxD7esaskYtguzGTZrIgvCJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10046,"name":"mecha"},{"id":194008,"name":"edited from tv series"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"},{"id":211628,"name":"real robot"},{"id":288168,"name":"gundam"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"HD Remaster version","release_date":"2023-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2006-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2008-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
