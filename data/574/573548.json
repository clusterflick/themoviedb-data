His discovery of DNA’s structure, the double helix, revolutionized human understanding of how life works. He was a relentless and sometimes ruthless visionary who led the Human Genome project and turned Harvard University and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory into powerhouses of molecular biology. With unprecedented access to Watson, his wife Elizabeth and sons Rufus and Duncan over the course of a year, American Masters explores Watson’s evolution from socially awkward postdoc to notorious scientific genius to discredited nonagenarian, also interviewing his friends, his colleagues, scientists and historians.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/9eahnQcUe7n1IzxMj2rEmfCLTTl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Decoding Watson","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242417,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Mannucci","original_name":"Mark Mannucci","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e239236bfeb8b0013d1f81e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242417,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Mannucci","original_name":"Mark Mannucci","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23923c1bf2660012f93e29","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1098997,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Ricciardi","original_name":"Alex Ricciardi","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e239249bfeb8b0013d1f84e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2514008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hannah Meagher","original_name":"Hannah Meagher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e239256397df000149bf7e6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147251,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Scott Sinkler","original_name":"Scott Sinkler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2392681bf2660012f93e8a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9eahnQcUe7n1IzxMj2rEmfCLTTl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
