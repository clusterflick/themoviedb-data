Childhood friends, André Fontaine and Michel Leroy find themselves in the Alps. André had been walking around France for three years with a baby bather who spit fire and gave him a line in the street. As for Michel, he was moping around in a Montreal bar. Without admitting it, they needed each other. The duo quickly reunited and traveled to Paris in a Citroën Acadiane, equipped like a house, where fame awaited them. Michel discovers the \"Old Country\" and his thirst for recognition is coupled with a quest for identity, that of his Breton origins.","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":"/w6E9JLLteZrruaLBpKKJD8vxwaR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un voyage entre amis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Beccu","original_name":"Pierre Beccu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc2296f31af03a65b498a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Beccu","original_name":"Pierre Beccu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc258414291009211a035","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1407536,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stéphane Perriot","original_name":"Stéphane Perriot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc23055c1f40061ed240d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460322,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikolas Javelle","original_name":"Nikolas Javelle","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc24655c1f4008be8ba51","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1768296,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maurice Giraud","original_name":"Maurice Giraud","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc237bdc34c044a303160","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Beccu","original_name":"Pierre Beccu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c329b940e0a2655ee43c1e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0280169","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6E9JLLteZrruaLBpKKJD8vxwaR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
