The exoticism conveyed in Western film adaptations greatly appealed to Cantonese opera and film writer Ma Si-tsang, who adapted The Thief of Bagdad (1924) into Cantonese opera The Prince of Thieves, set in an ancient empire influenced by both East and West. In 1958, director Luk Bong adapted the play into a film, turning the thief of the original film into a Robin Hood-esque hero who poses as a prince to compete for the princess' hand in marriage. Packed with a thrilling treasure hunt and a damsel-in-distress rescue as well as eye-catching special effects, Prince of Thieves is 100% a romantic swashbuckler.","popularity":0.2354,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince of Thieves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"賊王子","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ho Fei-Fan","original_name":"Ho Fei-Fan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c3697d8c3a3685f01274d20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1331009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mui Yee","original_name":"Mui Yee","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c3697e40e0a2631bc53f3fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lam Kau","original_name":"Lam Kau","popularity":0.4297,"profile_path":"/7P4smSKH60iAvfFI9Xg6Eu6m9mL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c3697f20e0a2631b053f469","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2212520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Bo-ying","original_name":"Lee Bo-ying","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9Uu8Z0SernEJ3sLT6uWOz9DEf1S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c3697fec3a3685efa274983","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3424802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ging-Fan","original_name":"李景帆","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"674231fb6370ecad3fffe0ca","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Yuen-Man","original_name":"Lee Yuen-Man","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c369855c3a3685f01274d7c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luk Bong","original_name":"Luk Bong","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c369813925141531f248445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698099,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Poon Cheuk","original_name":"Poon Cheuk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c369864c3a3685ee9274bdb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1744552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tianzong Chen","original_name":"Tianzong Chen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/coELoRIahg94wIdxFxtwVXhi2rF.jpg","credit_id":"5c36982fc3a3685efa2749b2","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713074,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cheung Wah","original_name":"Cheung Wah","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c369924c3a3685ef6274bb4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guohua","original_name":"Guohua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c36993ac3a3685ef6274bd7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212535,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Wong Kat-sing","original_name":"Wong Kat-sing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3698f5c3a3685ef6274b45","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698786,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yu Shun","original_name":"Yu Shun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c369912925141532c248684","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186849,"name":"literary adaptation"},{"id":243467,"name":"cantonese opera"},{"id":250682,"name":"middle eastern folktale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
