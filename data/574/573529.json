For much of the 20th century, Carl Sandburg (Jan. 6, 1878 – July 22, 1967) was synonymous with the American experience, a spokesman on behalf of “the people.” One of the most successful writers in the English language, Sandburg was a three-time Pulitzer Prize-winner for his poetry (Cornhuskers, 1918 and Complete Poems, 1950) and part of his six-volume Lincoln biography (Abraham Lincoln: The War Years, 1939). He was also a groundbreaking journalist, folk song collector, children’s storyteller, political organizer/activist, novelist, autobiographer, and captivating performer. Yet, after his death, Sandburg’s literary legacy faded and his poems, once taught in schools across America, were dismissed under the weight of massive critical attack.","popularity":0.1843,"poster_path":"/iCdFphqs5aGxEVVDWLMBZGYozch.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39477,"logo_path":"/hfXGuDnuVFOYJVfw83fJvGUtt5O.png","name":"KQED","origin_country":"US"},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day Carl Sandburg Died","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Allis","original_name":"Matthew Allis","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carl Sandberg (College)","credit_id":"63a9fb6ae4b57600dbea9318","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bonesteel","original_name":"Paul Bonesteel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9fb0276eecf00849b81f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bonesteel","original_name":"Paul Bonesteel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9fb34bfeb8b008d560b86","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iCdFphqs5aGxEVVDWLMBZGYozch.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"American Masters (PBS)","release_date":"2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
