This particular carp will be eaten stuffed during a family meal.  Carp stuffed (in the Polish fashion), also called in yiddish (Gefilte Fish) is a traditional dish eaten by Ashkenazi Jews. It is cooked, sweetened and served as a cold dish at the start of the meal. The head is reserved for the head of the family.  The film, set in Brussels, on the day of the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah), aims to show the culinary preparation together with the accompanying prayers and ritual. It focuses particularly on the sacrifice of the fish and on the issue of mass extermination.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/5F5dM9nzOt7IHarAliQCvLVQ0iF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19840,"logo_path":"/wMwpc8pEyLec92n33kr4Px2378D.png","name":"Wallonie Image Production","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent as a Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Wandel","original_name":"Nadine Wandel","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c321a64c3a3682913ab5f0b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Lehman","original_name":"Boris Lehman","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/1CElhTCznn4EcV5rBJoPMixCoqA.jpg","credit_id":"5c3219e1925141635e71d762","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338607,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antoine-Marie Meert","original_name":"Antoine-Marie Meert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c321a0e9251416e4571b059","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Lehman","original_name":"Daniel Lehman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c321a4e9251415f3c71fc0e","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Lehman","original_name":"Boris Lehman","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/1CElhTCznn4EcV5rBJoPMixCoqA.jpg","credit_id":"5c3219d30e0a2663023c934f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9959,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Bonfanti","original_name":"Antoine Bonfanti","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/mrRqvA3Cl5fmfKmF9O7ETLGIpu8.jpg","credit_id":"5c321a310e0a2666043c1967","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958228,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel de Valck","original_name":"Daniel de Valck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c321a249251416e4571b072","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Preszow","original_name":"Gérard Preszow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c321a59c3a36879cfa6a669","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henri Morelle","original_name":"Henri Morelle","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":"/3ztGX9XBGL0zZa3N1PxtJRZWfMj.jpg","credit_id":"5c321a1ac3a3680835a6c54d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Lehman","original_name":"Boris Lehman","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/1CElhTCznn4EcV5rBJoPMixCoqA.jpg","credit_id":"5c3219ee9251416e4571b04f","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Clisse","original_name":"Jacques Clisse","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c321a3e0e0a2664f33c4836","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12526418","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5F5dM9nzOt7IHarAliQCvLVQ0iF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
