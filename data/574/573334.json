The special also looks at how the genre fell out of favor with audiences and filmmakers in the ‘70s and ‘80s, only to be reborn with more recent films like Gladiator, and Dances with Wolves trilogy. Throughout, the special is packed with classic scenes and behind-the-scenes images from such films as The Birth of a Nation (1915), Gone With the Wind (1939), Samson & Delilah (1949), The Ten Commandments (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), El Cid (1961), King of Kings (1961), Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Doctor Zhivago (1965).","popularity":0.7996,"poster_path":"/zIZcsasCCmk0NdmDQIZtGUCB5up.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15258,"logo_path":"/d6Aqo5YatP3SUkMi1PEwT0nK0GB.png","name":"DreamWorks Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10915,"logo_path":"/9NERkCpElyvb6RWNnWp4G4XWAKa.png","name":"Turner Classic Movies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Night at the Movies: The Gigantic World of Epics","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Osborne","original_name":"Robert Osborne","popularity":0.2003,"profile_path":"/bFfmauxhtvh1kKOej899kEiNC6M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3265aec3a3682915ac2dc6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Spielberg","original_name":"Steven Spielberg","popularity":2.959,"profile_path":"/tZxcg19YQ3e8fJ0pOs7hjlnmmr6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3265c0c3a3680835a7439f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Branagh","original_name":"Kenneth Branagh","popularity":2.3128,"profile_path":"/AbCqqFxNi5w3nDUFdQt0DGMFh5H.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3265dc0e0a267eb33efc7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Landau","original_name":"Martin Landau","popularity":0.9743,"profile_path":"/2BkrH2w5W1lbv8YQQeEHX6mYiEX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c3265f30e0a2614553eff3e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Sharif","original_name":"Omar Sharif","popularity":1.6765,"profile_path":"/yDUBIJa5BdktDzSgCkKEZLz7KxH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c32660e9251416d94721e8f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Bouzereau","original_name":"Laurent Bouzereau","popularity":0.451,"profile_path":"/1gVpS5EGGwXXry6xSXo8xfkDlBu.jpg","credit_id":"5c32625bc3a3680835a73c8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Bouzereau","original_name":"Laurent Bouzereau","popularity":0.451,"profile_path":"/1gVpS5EGGwXXry6xSXo8xfkDlBu.jpg","credit_id":"5c3262500e0a2666043c9274","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1584914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54utuDPeGbAUHP41kndwMJvlKoT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":768,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zIZcsasCCmk0NdmDQIZtGUCB5up.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
