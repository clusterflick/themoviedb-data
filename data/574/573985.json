The company would try, with varying degrees of success, to prepare for tomorrow and where the business might go. Heck..maybe it wasn’t with pro bodybuilding or Gobbledy Gookers. But they had to give it a shot!  They would transition the heavyweight title away from Hulkamania and more towards the Warrior galaxies above! A red-faced preacher type was getting in our faces every week and driving the babyfaces crazy. The man behind that character was also running much of WWE TV that year and he is our guest for an exclusive journey back to that year of 1990…Bruce Prichard.
