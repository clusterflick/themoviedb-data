In this journey appears the memory of a photo for Karin Eitel, a young woman, tortured and detained during the dictatorship, to whom I owe my name.

In the background, the memory of a childhood in Chile, a country that reconstructed its democracy omitting its own history.","popularity":0.161,"poster_path":"/y83uXNwyCUVLk6QZTsImFKcoC7o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pequén Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":83545,"logo_path":"/fkMCjb5BHOJ56BdYfM6JEunRKp7.png","name":"Cinestación","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":28170,"logo_path":null,"name":"3 Moinhos Produções Artísticas","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2019-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A peculiar coincidence","title":"Story of My Name","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karin Cuyul","original_name":"Karin Cuyul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c34b6159251414822dcf700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1115931,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catalina Marín Duarte","original_name":"Catalina Marín Duarte","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c552cb5c3a368424681ce04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232474,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nicolás Tabilo","original_name":"Nicolás Tabilo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c552cf5c3a3680b5784b354","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648625,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roberto Collío","original_name":"Roberto Collío","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c552cd70e0a26031bc5d468","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007768,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felipe Bello","original_name":"Felipe Bello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c552c9392514116fc55d074","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1088208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominga Sotomayor","original_name":"Dominga Sotomayor","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/riLkpCR7S4P9914USEnfbaMLTwb.jpg","credit_id":"5c6af3e49251412fc40b0649","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karin Cuyul","original_name":"Karin Cuyul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6af41c0e0a262b349a8a03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747949,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josephine Schroeder","original_name":"Josephine Schroeder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f650ce95a78840036ae2814","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783884,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Alice de Morais","original_name":"Ana Alice de Morais","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yAPe0BY8WKw9eBbPWblUUXXbFDx.jpg","credit_id":"5f650cff84448e003966f8eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2732854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valentina Arango","original_name":"Valentina Arango","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f650d24e33f830035f4e490","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10513286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y83uXNwyCUVLk6QZTsImFKcoC7o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":677},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7R4ZCWqcuVFw9WdsZh092mMvfHp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Santiago International Documentary Film Festival (FIDOCS)","release_date":"2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2019-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Historia de mi nombre - TRAILER","key":"312855842","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-23T01:17:19.000Z","id":"5f650d75dbcade00371974ab"}]}}}
