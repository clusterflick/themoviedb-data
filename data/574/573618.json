He meets a young woman named Shino who works in a small restaurant in the Komagome area of Tokyo. They fall in love, and he takes her to his family home through the heavy snow for their wedding. He introduces Shino to his elderly parents and his sister; they spend their wedding night together listening to bells ringing on sleighs gliding past across the moonlit snow. The next morning, wrapped in their small world of happiness, they go to a hot spring in the mountains to begin their honeymoon.","popularity":0.1594,"poster_path":"/5RwDaD128N2pWzofU6AZaZbXLo9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kazumo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shinobugawa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomokazu Miura","original_name":"三浦友和","popularity":0.9632,"profile_path":"/2tKusMF6dzGOfH7MM73FCsJzRoJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"I","credit_id":"5ce72f899251417824ba00a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaori Takahashi","original_name":"高橋かおり","popularity":0.2899,"profile_path":"/WXKsfG4bPQZEjyz2uO3nWEqzNV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shino","credit_id":"5ce72f8f9251414a92bde711","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659699,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kôichi Takeuchi","original_name":"Kôichi Takeuchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62149aef0b5fd6001b2ae486","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497849,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Naotaka Kawamura","original_name":"Naotaka Kawamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62149ae21a32480044566c50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2125758,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tetsuo Miura","original_name":"三浦哲郎","popularity":0.1255,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62149ab2a39d0b00424b55ec","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiko Obayashi","original_name":"大林宣彦","popularity":0.416,"profile_path":"/r0VbfQh53j5ByKVT6xbogfvh24d.jpg","credit_id":"5c344b8a9251414836dc886a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RwDaD128N2pWzofU6AZaZbXLo9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
