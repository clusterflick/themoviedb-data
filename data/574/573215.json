It consists of seven parts, each one presenting an ideotype of the human body, from the beginning of civilization up to the present time. The body as a concept or dogma is simply the embodied reflection of every civilization, upon which man himself is established. The anthropomorphism that characterizes the sum total of perception, in a clear or latent state, comes from the fact that the human body, as reality, idea and expression, comprises the ultimate reference.","popularity":0.0978,"poster_path":"/cvKZ3U7PW3S5giIDfNBzlOURn5E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stefi
