Inspired by her time living and working in the city in the 1990s, Zausner created a series of three outsized figures made from rubber silicon and knitted material. This film features Zausner interacting with these figures in a sequence filmed at key landmarks in the city, including the Potsdamer Platz, Neue Nationalgalerie, Spree River, and the now-demolished Palast der Republik. In every scene, we see the heft of the figures counteracting her manoeuvres of them, turning the idea of the body as a metaphor  for the weight of history from abstraction to physical reality.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Zausner","original_name":"Holly Zausner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"612c4fa1e04aca002350cbaf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073881,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jakobine Motz","original_name":"Jakobine Motz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612c4fb3a27502002afea9f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Zausner","original_name":"Holly Zausner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612c4fa942f19f0066afd5dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216572,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Schick","original_name":"Thomas Schick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612c4fbbbf09d1002aa68938","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
