The two projectors are aligned so that they overlap by a third, defining an expanded frame that approaches wide-screen proportions. Each projector shows a cycle of primary and secondary colours. A third set of colours appears in the overlap of the two projectors, and as the pace of each cycle increases there's an additional form of colour mixing. The size of the frame that each projector displays grows narrower as the piece progresses, making for illusions of circling and weaving movement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thirds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1831021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Payne","original_name":"Simon Payne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fprOxni9CWZ7DA1T1DbTStMnzF0.jpg","credit_id":"612b691f12197e002a68e42a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
