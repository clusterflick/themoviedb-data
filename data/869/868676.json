In the quietude of their studios they chisel and stroke their inner creatures to life, but the real world always calls them back to their families. Somewhere between the delicate inner world of the artist and the inescapable hold of reality lies the meaning that gives their labour a purpose: a young mother feeding her baby as sunlight pours in through the window; a child scribbling his first drawing on a piece of paper; a father having a smoke at sunset as his son plays on the playground. Shot in a fly-on-the-wall style, THE WILL TO ART is a unique exercise in cinematic voyeurism that offers a candid glimpse into what it means to be an artist, what it means to be a family, and what it means to be human.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7JIvxEphEeRecXKTDWyxcLIHLkY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Will To Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793505,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ikhbayar Urchuud","original_name":"Ikhbayar Urchuud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wej3vxbN7lHHlRBQ5Uoxho5hCIT.jpg","credit_id":"612bc4bf223e20002fda7066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JIvxEphEeRecXKTDWyxcLIHLkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mn","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
