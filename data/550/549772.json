The movie follows three teens growing up in 1980's New York. Pinky, Mars and Martha all three girls share a common thread of trajedy , pain and abandonment. Gripping in its raw and intimitate protrayal of the girls everyday lives. Girltalk is a must see movie. This is truly one of the rarest forms of the beauty and heartbreaking tale of survival.","popularity":0.1282,"poster_path":"/npvtvbcCrhZKsfAgJgXnqRH7iO8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girltalk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Davis","original_name":"Kate Davis","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f5da4ec3bffe007a72cc04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125119","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npvtvbcCrhZKsfAgJgXnqRH7iO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
