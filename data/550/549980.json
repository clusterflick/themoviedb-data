Previously occupied by the 17th century agrarian socialists The Diggers, the land is currently inhabited by a Natural History Society whose occupations include bat and moth trapping, mycology, tree measuring and botanical walks.  After two years of filming on the land, the footage was shown to the members of the Society. Their memories and responses were recorded and subsequently used as part of the film’s narration. The film does not offer a comprehensive record of the history of humans within the area. Instead, it explores more intimately, human’s relationship with and within land and nature.","popularity":0.1114,"poster_path":"/43qiB6HT6vQE0ZiJvFwmasJg0ue.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Pond","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Sarah Rinland","original_name":"Jessica Sarah Rinland","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/pk2GVAUDZYP5p9XTlT9UnsHqHT5.jpg","credit_id":"5ba7a15f0e0a2635e702c2e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10994166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w9GhH4hq7WZeEuUPC8vbGah3Tkk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/43qiB6HT6vQE0ZiJvFwmasJg0ue.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxgJsK4nKiDkaDxNOp604jy2XOW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Pond | Jessica Rinland | 27a Mostra Internacional Films de Dones Barcelona","key":"c0I2jfnSAlI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-20T10:18:54.000Z","id":"606ccbd69ca75900578777f9"}]}}}
