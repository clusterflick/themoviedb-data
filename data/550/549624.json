Cly is a streetwise runaway, waiting tables by day and stripping by night.  Both are fighting for existence in the slime-bowl of New York's gutters, where drugs and prostitution are the only currency. Ray is in over the top with the Mafia and Cly is emotionally destroyed by the absence of her father.  Severence is a gripping story set against the seedy backdrop of New York City, where broken dreams and empty promises litter the streets.","popularity":0.413,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":253908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euphoria Films Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A passionate and disturbing story of one man's battle against the mafia...","title":"Severance","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3702720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Christian Jones","original_name":"Linda Christian Jones","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"P.J.","credit_id":"67b47518e0d9f833bc6dbd8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Haber","original_name":"Martin Haber","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67b47565c5fe1f0aefe0d71a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5254367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Liotta","original_name":"Lou Liotta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ray Ponti","credit_id":"67b47589c5fe1f0aefe0d736","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132151,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Marinaro","original_name":"Martin Marinaro","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Richie","credit_id":"67b475bd1ed45284539fb341","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Pistilli","original_name":"Carl Pistilli","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"67b475ec2f5de15573e0d2b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Nicole Wolpe","original_name":"Lisa Nicole Wolpe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Cly Ponti","credit_id":"67b4762ff35d4102096dd304","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Max Steinberg","original_name":"David Max Steinberg","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51aedc3a3680832019ac5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132149,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cindy Hochman","original_name":"Cindy Hochman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51b150e0a26322e018e2a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Max Steinberg","original_name":"David Max Steinberg","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51b220e0a26322e018e49","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Bohrer","original_name":"Ann Bohrer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51b37c3a368083d019dcd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132151,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Marinaro","original_name":"Martin Marinaro","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51b420e0a26322e018e79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Nicole Wolpe","original_name":"Lisa Nicole Wolpe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51b4dc3a368083a018371","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117952,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel May","original_name":"Daniel May","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba51b8d9251412deb015907","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0096074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6593,"name":"stripper"},{"id":10562,"name":"on the run"},{"id":10391,"name":"mafia"},{"id":240303,"name":"father daughter relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Severance - Trailer","key":"7ARW042y8t4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-02-01T12:33:08.000Z","id":"5fe82f6f1f3e60003d53e78e"}]}}}
