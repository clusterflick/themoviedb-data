Emerging from tunnel at Arnos Grove our train continues to Cockfosters in Hertfordshire.  The section between Acton Town and Hammersmith is unique in being the only 'tube' line to feature express running - leaving the parallel District line to provide the stopping service.  We then return to Acton Town and board another 1973 stock train for a drivers's eye view of the Heathrow Airport branch, running via Terminal 4 to end at Terminals 1, 2 & 3. This line, much of which was built by the District Railway, has another unique feature for a tube line, a quadruple track section from Acton Town to Northfields.  As well as seeing four closed stations from the driver's cab we also pay a visit to Aldwych, the terminus of the short branch which ran from Holborn but closed in 1994.","popularity":0.1371,"poster_path":"/7zpocpNQXt26dl3AHzG2ad0YunL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video 125","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piccadilly Driver's Eye View","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Curling","original_name":"Rob Curling","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/ir5SJncmOBMY3H4Yslmv110xvnA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ba377b3c3a36833930187a3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741840,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Middleton","original_name":"Peter Middleton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3778d925141523d0148e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741840,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Middleton","original_name":"Peter Middleton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3779a0e0a265e4e018597","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9b4QTbqCjYWCace5tSdkgoRNq2k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7zpocpNQXt26dl3AHzG2ad0YunL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/bnadIpqAaWwv0EhwNLbNZXLqRih.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Piccadilly Driver's eye view preview","key":"N_FGTzAHGf8","published_at":"2011-02-03T10:08:44.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bda308992514153fd0009a4"}]}}}
