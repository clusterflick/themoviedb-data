Working the land and making textiles to sell, Zulay’s industrious family sent all of their daughters to school — at the time an unusual move in Quinchuqui — and raised an intelligent, independent daughter whose literacy, business sense and introduction to the Preloráns led her to try her luck in the States. Devoted to her village, she relates a mesmerizing account of Otavaleñan traditions and reflects on her experiences in the US.","popularity":0.0675,"poster_path":"/zYHAdYq1OqrsXEaMbra7jlgTSWa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zulay, Facing the 21st Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133248,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dorio Barbieri","original_name":"Dorio Barbieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba6fc3ec3a3680e5001f1ef","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Prelorán","original_name":"Jorge Prelorán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba6fbfc0e0a2635f601c6ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Prelorán","original_name":"Jorge Prelorán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba6fc5e0e0a2635f301ce9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mabel Prelorán","original_name":"Mabel Prelorán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba6fc720e0a2635e701d8b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Prelorán","original_name":"Jorge Prelorán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba6fc4fc3a3680e6501b436","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYHAdYq1OqrsXEaMbra7jlgTSWa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
