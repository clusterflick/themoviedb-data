Fascinated by voodoo cult objects, she began with buying them to avoid their scattering abroad. Over the years it became the largest collection in the world to be donated to Haiti. The film shows the beauty of these objects, their significance and importance to the world's cultural heritage and highlights the link between voodoo (Haitian vodou), the slave insurgency and the creation of the first black nation.","popularity":0.3979,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"voodoo, vodou, voudou, ethnography, anthropology, religion, history, art history, Haiti, Ayiti","title":"A vodou memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Lichtenstein","original_name":"Irene Lichtenstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba6be1a9251412f070150f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3392,"name":"voodoo"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"},{"id":167890,"name":"voodoo ritual"},{"id":227593,"name":"ethnographic film"},{"id":246960,"name":"post colonialism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
