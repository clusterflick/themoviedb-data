The disputed 277 square miles of sea, known as the Gray Zone, were traditionally fished by US lobstermen. But as the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than nearly any other body of water on the planet, the areaâ€™s previously modest lobster population has surged. As a result, Canadians have begun to assert their sovereignty, warring with the Americans to claim the bounty.","popularity":0.2084,"poster_path":"/47DH2fxprknAT159XRinNPIZUzD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109051,"logo_path":null,"name":"As It Happens Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lobster War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Cates","original_name":"Brian Cates","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Cutler Maine Lobsterman","credit_id":"60873c9a55c926002b7b45dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Guptill","original_name":"Brian Guptill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self -  Grand Manan Fishermen's Assoc.","credit_id":"60873cfb960cde002a8865bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Murray","original_name":"Mark Murray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Maine Marine Patrol","credit_id":"60873d252da8460029842935","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Leavitt","original_name":"Jason Leavitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Maine Marine Patrol","credit_id":"60873d54435abd003f6873cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3068683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristan Porter","original_name":"Kristan Porter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self - Cutler Maine Lobsterman","credit_id":"60873d9a8d22fc0058c16847","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Abel","original_name":"David Abel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3d8c10e0a262695001b90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Laub","original_name":"Andy Laub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3d8d692514103fc001bd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Laub","original_name":"Andy Laub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3d9c1c3a3687b21002102","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Laub","original_name":"Andy Laub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3d9d49251410400001e74","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Abel","original_name":"David Abel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3d9dfc3a3687b1500203d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Abel","original_name":"David Abel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3d9fa0e0a262693002668","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Laub","original_name":"Andy Laub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3da039251410411001ebd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Laub","original_name":"Andy Laub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3da1a9251410400001efb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10885068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"lobsterwar","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"lobsterwar"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":2152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4c7i5np1zCmS2qo7GN69yTLS1V6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3832},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bGquuSpqDulgHf4tYYOIsVbDFs3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/47DH2fxprknAT159XRinNPIZUzD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1860,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s6L0YRCFvkXUBppY32xkyzfPqmw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Maritime Film Festival","release_date":"2018-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
