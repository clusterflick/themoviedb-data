Her mother scooped her up to save her from the boiling mud. Her neighbors ran for their lives. Sixteen villages, including Dian's, were wiped away, forever buried under 60 feet of mud. A decade later, 60,000 people have been displaced from what was once a thriving industrial and residential area in East Java. Dozens of factories, schools and mosques are completely submerged under a moonscape of ooze and grit. The cause? Lapindo, an Indonesian company drilling for natural gas in 2006, unleashed a violent, unstoppable flow of hot sludge from the earth's depths. It is estimated that the mudflow will not end for another decade. Shot over the course of six years, GRIT bears witness to Dian's transformation from young girl to a politically active teenager as she and her mother launch a resistance campaign against the drilling company.","popularity":0.2823,"poster_path":"/gRukAy5IYE9duzbkITrLXW8OZxO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grit","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1107494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cynthia Wade","original_name":"Cynthia Wade","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba30bdac3a368338f00b3f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sasha Friedlander","original_name":"Sasha Friedlander","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba30be6c3a368338f00b40b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracie Holder","original_name":"Tracie Holder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d825027cabfe400248af48b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2151555,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Syrett","original_name":"Matthew Syrett","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d825003d34eb3001c507262","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1107494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cynthia Wade","original_name":"Cynthia Wade","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2b69cb98f1f10018f8d016","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667173,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boaz Freund","original_name":"Boaz Freund","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2b69e9532acb0017516d72","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bao Nguyen","original_name":"Bao Nguyen","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/5FfpwFSXOemJiRlgr1oICtNLa6E.jpg","credit_id":"67154800e6edc3bad60ff8e0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8171864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Gy5VEVxTpWE8wRMAmsg6xqdTI5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":938,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRukAy5IYE9duzbkITrLXW8OZxO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":626}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs","release_date":"2018-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
