Some of the most exciting footage can be obtained in different ways. Examples are: a large herd, such as of reindeer, moving as one; slow motion footage of fast moving animals, such as racing greyhounds, especially when they do something unexpected; mothers and their newborn offspring doing what comes naturally; animals placed among special props; animals placed in human situations; combining the exciting and dangerous, such as the running of the bulls in Pamplona and the bullfights to follow; placing animals that are not natural companions together; and placing animals in the situation of a challenge, such as a bunch of bananas just out of reach of a hungry monkey. Many of these elements are combined into the final sequence of a steeplechase race.","popularity":0.1951,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animals in Action","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pete Smith Specialty: Animals in Motion","type":"Series title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ba2b16c925141690000bd30","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028240,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Ansen","original_name":"Joe Ansen","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba2b1b992514168f900cc29","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","credit_id":"5bf401cec3a36838ab02bdce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Dietrick","original_name":"Joseph Dietrick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf401de0e0a264f6e0317be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1636421","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1955-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
