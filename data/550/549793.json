Although Lewis is African American, and Chen is half Hispanic and half Asian, they have found strength in their differences throughout their first three years of high school. But the two are torn apart when an intelligence test is issued to limit the enrollment to their predominately white wealthy high school before their senior year...suspiciously at the same time that a proposition ends all existing Affirmative Action laws.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Test","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Suthamannont","original_name":"Victor Suthamannont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Chen Gonzales","credit_id":"5ba63dc40e0a2635f600b02b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daryl Watson","original_name":"Daryl Watson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lewis Washington","credit_id":"5ba63dd30e0a2635f300b34e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed Morano","original_name":"Reed Morano","popularity":0.1674,"profile_path":"/fXtvqRCPMDhXwvgc3V2oC4GT3AP.jpg","credit_id":"6058704b22931a0054ec2b75","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Frintrup","original_name":"Peter Frintrup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba63d9a9251412f01009df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Frintrup","original_name":"Peter Frintrup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba63e6ac3a3680e5800ac23","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Frintrup","original_name":"Peter Frintrup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba63e51c3a3680e5000c00b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132772,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven W.
