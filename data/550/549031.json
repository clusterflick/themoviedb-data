The film is collaboration work between filmmaker Makino Takashi and painter and filmmaker Ishida Takashi. Ishida has been  interested in live-picture, the process of paint, and Makino’s interest is to make a new image with extremely high speed random images. With Makino’s skills in telecine, Ishida’s painted lines were rolled and scrolled, and became “the living line”. The film is maybe a chance, or maybe it is a fight. Perhaps, this film will show you both elements.
