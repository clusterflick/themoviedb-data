This activist collective of teachers and filmmakers, formed on the occasion of this film, attempts to explain the Palestinian problem through interviews. The Olivier was one of the first films to attempt to give substance to what was still largely ignored in the West: the existence of the Palestinian people and their fight to recover their rights. L'Olivier responds to a concern: the already weak support of French public opinion for the Palestinian cause diminished following the Munich operation of 1972. Structured in such a way as to tell the Palestinian story and explain the state of the struggle at the time, the film appeals to global militant solidarity and, in particular, to European political commitments.","popularity":0.2261,"poster_path":"/poddvycybvOBViOF7Hka07TmnvG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Groupe Cinéma Vincennes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1976-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Olive Tree","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2497914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sheikh Imam","original_name":"Sheikh Imam","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/oz6nSFlsCM2lQUIstraFBJkWm9a.jpg","credit_id":"65dbf0bb5f2db10164bf642e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Narboni","original_name":"Jean Narboni","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mTWFv4R56v0wp7tZlfBikxIIHI8.jpg","credit_id":"5ba30948c3a3683398009fd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Le Péron","original_name":"Serge Le Péron","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3093a0e0a265e4e009c6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Dubroux","original_name":"Danièle Dubroux","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/rXPlTRE3CUdPbBRCLYwxv7BU4PQ.jpg","credit_id":"5ba3092dc3a368338f00acb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2131333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Akika","original_name":"Ali Akika","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/obmCkpLB2aqCwgBssaBsSO2GBpq.jpg","credit_id":"5ba3090fc3a368338f00ac67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Villain","original_name":"Dominique Villain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba30955925141523d0089b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Chapoullie","original_name":"Guy Chapoullie","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba3091f925141524500a26c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel Commo","original_name":"Michel Commo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6714171999f22f326aad30d5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010260,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mustafa Al-Hallaj","original_name":"Mustafa Al-Hallaj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671417a8d5b7926e946fe140","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mustafa Al-Kurd","original_name":"Mustafa Al-Kurd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671417d5d5b7926e946fe164","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0348695","wikidata_id":"Q67322111","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bhPak8ptuvelgcFdz1rnZm1KwKD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rY1LYR6PR2zEEOTOhaixTQe8PjD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/poddvycybvOBViOF7Hka07TmnvG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkWIy9wEqtLZLSlbnnFfiDAlcDd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":298877,"name":"palestinian resistance"},{"id":328713,"name":"militant cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
