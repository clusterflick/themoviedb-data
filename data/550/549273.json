He pulls out a few to show real-life events caught on camera. He pulls out spools of film that include clips of the effects of heavy rain, of early attempts to fly, of an auto race with a spectacular series of crashes, and, last, of the destruction of a suspension bridge newly-built near Tacoma, buffeted and then ruptured by wind. None of these events were staged, and the camera caught them.","popularity":0.2077,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Camera Caught It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ba2afd7925141690300a934","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff York","original_name":"Jeff York","popularity":0.3643,"profile_path":"/oAhxdTKc3QbKLNvwAxztcOe00Bd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ba2afe5925141690000b938","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1404376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1954-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
