But just a few short years later, Akron's most important product was, ever so briefly, music. In the mid-1970s, a group of local bands took over an old rubber workers' hang-out in downtown Akron called The Crypt and created a mix of punk and art rock that came to be known as \"the Akron Sound.\" And for a while, it was almost \"the next big thing.\" Almost.  It's Everything, and Then It's Gone, a Western Reserve PBS production written and directed by Phil Hoffman., takes viewers back to a time when the music really did mean everything. And for the men and women in these local bands, it was a way out of the factory.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/j6oR1eyZiXrrjGzyj5frlWp74BB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Akron Sound: It's Everything, and Then It's Gone","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Walsh","original_name":"Joe Walsh","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/2cihrXQeODd0JiYd78IVu9whHW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58eb9944925141351f04c998","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793223,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Phil Hoffman","original_name":"Phil Hoffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eb98bbc3a36872f6086cb1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1388,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6oR1eyZiXrrjGzyj5frlWp74BB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":918}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":156137,"name":"music history"},{"id":189443,"name":"new wave"},{"id":234354,"name":"akron"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Western Reserve PBS","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
