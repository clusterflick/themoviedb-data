They will never speak with one another, and Joseph (we only learn his name during the credits) will never harm Höss, will not stop the flood of horrible murders with yet another murder. This short sketch about life of a death camp makes us feel pain and grief of millions of people who had passed beyond the walls of the shaving room during the imprisonment of Joseph, the man who outlived his torturer.","popularity":0.4067,"poster_path":"/ccNIJFrHK5MnU8zIt1Z6RMPX1XT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope Dies Last","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581206,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andrew Grose","original_name":"Andrew Grose","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Officer","credit_id":"5bb2ce7f9251411cb9000c69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2139704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarek Slater","original_name":"Tarek Slater","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jösef","credit_id":"5bb2ce839251411cb0000c74","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Price","original_name":"Ben Price","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea6193c3a368731a07c459","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Price","original_name":"Ben Price","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09dc00c3a3685fdf2042d4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5958842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ccNIJFrHK5MnU8zIt1Z6RMPX1XT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/43xylqWdhMt2Ov55TeeN2ken7YA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1631,"name":"concentration camp"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":2450,"name":"auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Holly Short Film Festival","release_date":"2017-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
