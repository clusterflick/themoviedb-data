Their EP Gay? ('96) received a perfect rating from Pitchfork. From there, the band signed with V2 records, and made the albums Split Personalities ('98) and Separation Anxieties ('00), which was produced by Todd Rundgren. Accidents Waiting To Happen charts the band’s history, with candid interviews of band members, critics, fans, and others involved with the band, alongside never-before-seen archival material. Inspired by Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz, the film weaves 12 Rods’ history with footage from their January 2015 reunion show. Fans of Minneapolis’ 90s rock scene can’t miss this exciting documentary.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/h95sHkQeAXWDKiqkEpCD3GH4xfM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Accidents Waiting to Happen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1792242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Francis Flynn","original_name":"James Francis Flynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e92a27c3a36872af05e9e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6386862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":906,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h95sHkQeAXWDKiqkEpCD3GH4xfM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
