As Olga Rostova, an exotic Russian, she meets Norman Brooke, whose infatuation turns to love. Hoffman suggests that Norman could never care for Lizzie and proves his point. Heartbroken, Lizzie decides to see no more of him. On closing night, when he proposes to her in her dressing room and she refuses, Norman declares he must believe all the lurid details of her past; in desperation, she bares her true identity, only to find it is not her glamorous image but rather her real self that he loves.","popularity":0.3542,"poster_path":"/cLZNr6nQ9tCvPj1pEsMIamDIBFF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spotlight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Ralston","original_name":"Esther Ralston","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/1QFncrZpSppxeYKVByF4Jl8w9Xc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lizzie Stokes / Olga Rostova","credit_id":"58ed18b6c3a36872ee0a0dc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Hamilton","original_name":"Neil Hamilton","popularity":0.5186,"profile_path":"/23jm1XwaaBKWTp5fKs7kzThK4KZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Norman Brooke","credit_id":"58ed18dfc3a36872ee0a0dfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Soussanin","original_name":"Nicholas Soussanin","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":"/txZH9b6xq1LTQvZhjV9bFunp29D.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Daniel Hoffman","credit_id":"58ed18eb925141354c061f7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlette Marchal","original_name":"Arlette Marchal","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/v88RridOtWlc7ruQlVCMmcyf2X2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maggie Courtney","credit_id":"58ed18f7c3a36872f6099a9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Housman","original_name":"Arthur Housman","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/2fPg5nQenEcivr5yAHDafZP76h9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ebbetts","credit_id":"58ed1901c3a368732609759d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Tuttle","original_name":"Frank Tuttle","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/nHq1loTuTtQs416Koylh91hspNk.jpg","credit_id":"58ed1286c3a36872af08ffb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":726140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hope Loring","original_name":"Hope Loring","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/dVJKPiDhUvL4go1yl8nhLOhvESA.jpg","credit_id":"58ed129dc3a36872f6099579","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184027,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rita Weiman","original_name":"Rita Weiman","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/rPXWhUn7oerre375G7nQFS0wYpO.jpg","credit_id":"5cdcbbe69251413452cd7c58","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30258,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Victor Milner","original_name":"Victor Milner","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdcbc16c3a36836f6c71c7b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2439,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis D.
