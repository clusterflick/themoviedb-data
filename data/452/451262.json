Fortunately, she didn’t die and ended up marrying a wealthy man, making her hope that life would be better. The film makes the whole chance scenario look like a normal process that can happen to anyone. What a shame. Living it big, she starts to encounter paranormal instances in her new home that somehow has a strange connection to her husband. Bet she didn’t expect that.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":"/cmzGZjFK49M1g4N3hdECZnO8rP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2011-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Two Worlds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Nguyen","original_name":"Dustin Nguyen","popularity":0.7219,"profile_path":"/40TjXyYUSG3O01Zak4TJLz0oZN3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58e958d5925141351f02a864","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ngọc Diệp","original_name":"Ngọc Diệp","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/ueXSVd0DSgAgml3QCIC1fKrfMZN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58e95a8192514152ac01b1d0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mind Tít","original_name":"Mind Tít","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58e95aab925141351f02a950","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tam Tiet","original_name":"Tam Tiet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"58e95ad5c3a36872ee06b49e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1792367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Đình Hiếu","original_name":"Đình Hiếu","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/iOX3avIS1TZbNB9yWcrwztkHYl7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58e95aee925141281906748a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinh Vinh","original_name":"Dinh Vinh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58e95b06925141354c02b664","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Do Minh Vien","original_name":"Do Minh Vien","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e959d392514152ac01b169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vu Thai Hoa","original_name":"Vu Thai Hoa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e959e792514152ac01b17e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"vi","file_path":"/cmzGZjFK49M1g4N3hdECZnO8rP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"vi","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
