By 1933, he had reached rock bottom. How, in the space of a few years, did this uncontested genius of silent films, go from the status of being a widely-worshipped star to an alcoholic and solitary fallen idol?  With a spotlight on the 7 years during which his life changed, using extracts of Keaton’s films as magnifying mirrors, the documentary recounts the dramatic life of this creative genius and the Hollywood studios.","popularity":0.4249,"poster_path":"/ypigsVrQMLdcLBoinjjtNYZfXb4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22945,"logo_path":"/zRDp1tYw2I5DtyHcAJHiBx6Xaii.png","name":"Quark
