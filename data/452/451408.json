The programme follows a specialist pathology team as they conduct a post-mortem on the body of a 17-stone woman whose body was donated to medical science. Their findings, as they dissect the body and its organs, are startling, exposing the devastating impact of obesity with stunning visuals and fascinating medical facts.  Morbid obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of nine years and is blamed for over 30,000 deaths in the UK every year. With 65 per cent of people already overweight or obese, this extraordinary film is a powerful contribution to the debate about fat, food, lifestyle and how the health service will cope with the growing obesity crisis.","popularity":0.7632,"poster_path":"/ythG2RwuyJUMN4sNZ0CWQZ3N4Sq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1421,"logo_path":"/uWCPDzKkQnOxQ5spgKpD8wzSIP1.png","name":"World of Wonder","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obesity: The Post Mortem","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinette Robinson","original_name":"Vinette Robinson","popularity":0.5065,"profile_path":"/8hhfJbSfsD4T8o82bHuR1kIElpJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58ea9f79c3a36872f6079f3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Osborn","original_name":"Mike Osborn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dr Mike Osborn","credit_id":"58eaa02c925141281907b680","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Nolan","original_name":"Stephen Nolan","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eaa119925141351f03f147","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792907,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Weyman-Jones","original_name":"Chris Weyman-Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eaa0dd92514134eb041722","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melanie Archer","original_name":"Melanie Archer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea9b429251413ce401e5a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792901,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Satiyesh Manoharajah","original_name":"Satiyesh Manoharajah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea9b1ec3a36872f6079bdc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198345,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Condie","original_name":"Steve Condie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea9ae69251413ce401e55f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melanie Archer","original_name":"Melanie Archer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea9b5192514152ac030074","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1792900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Satiyesh Manoharajah","original_name":"Satiyesh Manoharajah","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea9b13c3a3684a7906cf9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792906,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleid Channing","original_name":"Aleid Channing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eaa08192514152ac03048a","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tim Cragg","original_name":"Tim Cragg","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eaa0f992514152ac0304cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6120500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tXgTmV2OURaaTrxrOabYz0EAIXG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wr2rBJHKumaUEVeqSkUC5VUxb6K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ythG2RwuyJUMN4sNZ0CWQZ3N4Sq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10292,"name":"gore"},{"id":4715,"name":"autopsy"},{"id":208788,"name":"medical drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Obesity: The Post Mortem | Behind the Scenes","key":"LW9WmnNrfQ8","published_at":"2016-09-13T12:05:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"58eaa2089251413ce401ea95"}]}}}
