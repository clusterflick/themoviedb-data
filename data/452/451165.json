Its story centers on a magnificent masked ball, given by a Russian prince, that brings together all the main characters in various disguises. The three-act journey from boudoir to ballroom to jail provides ample opportunities for farce and humor, but also for genuine human emotion and a surprisingly realistic view of urban life.","popularity":0.2726,"poster_path":"/uqBbu57fVthod4UceTPyiij7shS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glyndebourne Festival
