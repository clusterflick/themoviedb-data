Instead, Marie disguises herself as an elderly woman of considerable wealth and offers to bail Ernest out of his impending bankruptcy in exchange for marriage, with the understanding that if Ernest ever falls in love with another woman she will grant him a divorce. Then Marie disguises herself as June Dayne in order to make her husband fall in love with her. She succeeds, and when Ernest confesses his love for another woman, Marie discards her disguise and Ernest discovers that the woman with whom he is in love is his own wife.","popularity":0.3313,"poster_path":"/pHJBIXI7j1zepBkl279ekJirdUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norma Talmadge Film Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":20158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Select Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Loves and Lies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Elle aime et ment","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Talmadge","original_name":"Norma Talmadge","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/h8ES1kk8EEByz34sKaWMDyB6Ntv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie Callender, aka Marie Max and June Dayne","credit_id":"58ee875692514113a8002f26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conway Tearle","original_name":"Conway Tearle","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/f4YrbJ04k9Y8JE1wvt9mJpLjakj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ernest Lismore","credit_id":"58ee875ec3a3684818002f98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Octavia Broske","original_name":"Octavia Broske","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/n2woJtmVHiwqiKhsHY9MCDWEHr0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Polly Poplar","credit_id":"58ee8767c3a36847fb002bd2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Tead","original_name":"Phil Tead","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/4q1XWqdRkqBSrpysybXd3iwZikW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bob Brummell (as Phillips Tead)","credit_id":"58ee877092514113a4002e21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1382956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Darling","original_name":"Ida Darling","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/zWg3fWehi8l4R4k4qH8f5eILfl6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Carrie Chisholm","credit_id":"58ee8778c3a36847fb002bec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John T.
