In 1999, they met in Cuba, a country that seemed to mirror many of their questions, hopes and fears. The film looks at their real lives and different roads to exile; two utopian visions sought under very different conditions on separate continents. It is a double portrait of two extraordinary women that succeeds in avoiding the twin pitfalls of condemnation and glorification.","popularity":0.0794,"poster_path":"/49zflgOXqFBBuL90jFsHiv78CIg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158299,"logo_path":null,"name":"foschfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2000-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greater Freedom Lesser Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","title":"Igual sigo soñando, con dolor","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Barhoum","original_name":"María Barhoum","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a2e72dc925141032c163335","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge Viett","original_name":"Inge Viett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a2e72e40e0a264cc41581dc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Konrad","original_name":"Kristina Konrad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e728ac3a3680b9615f012","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Konrad","original_name":"Kristina Konrad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72909251410330156beb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Bolm","original_name":"Andreas Bolm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e729e0e0a264cbe15cb34","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Frosch","original_name":"Christian Frosch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72a5925141033915f895","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939133,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annabelle Wick","original_name":"Annabelle Wick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72b09251410330156c12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Konrad","original_name":"Kristina Konrad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72b99251410336162268","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001865,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Ruft","original_name":"Andreas Ruft","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72c30e0a264cca15d331","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001865,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Ruft","original_name":"Andreas Ruft","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72cb0e0a264cca15d340","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939134,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gato Leiras Wenczel","original_name":"Gato Leiras Wenczel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2e72d29251410336162296","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k364Zgwqy3ma8bDhYfwnNFjlN5g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49zflgOXqFBBuL90jFsHiv78CIg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2000-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
