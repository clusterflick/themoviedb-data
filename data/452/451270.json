The film showcases through intimate portraits, personal accounts and cinematographic tropes, Turkey’s eight borderlands revealing the political and cultural dynamics of life on those frontiers. The contemplation of all eight neighboring countries reveals the complexity and importance of Turkey’s geo-political position between West and East, Europe and Asia, the European Union and the Middle East.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/5SfyjBjSjkVgbYSzSVvAcdoUlpr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Plus Eight","title":"1+8","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1541924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cynthia Madansky","original_name":"Cynthia Madansky","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/1xnItWAX3LlHqOIgFtWMBlbS7rB.jpg","credit_id":"58e96ad79251414b280255f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Brudniak","original_name":"Angelika Brudniak","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e96ae89251413ce400a5b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3615300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1713,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5SfyjBjSjkVgbYSzSVvAcdoUlpr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1142},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/khXub3CIFLtwdcChNigMr9AlOwc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sUWh156i4KuqZUOKCcAQuaOYc1I.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1142}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
