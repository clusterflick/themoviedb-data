An Index of Metals bears vigorous witness to this determination to go beyond: sizzling orchestration, electric and psychedelic; a voice which plays on effects, murmurs with reverb, cackles into a megaphone, screams like a pop star; and an electric guitar score of a kind that no ‘serious’ composer has ever written, sliding across an infinite range of tones with a lightness of touch and blurring of contours.","popularity":0.2509,"poster_path":"/4WWDb2kqz9ARIFeQHM2WgQVMYjp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2003-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Index of Metals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fausto Romitelli","original_name":"Fausto Romitelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e7a5339251412810052849","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Pachini","original_name":"Paolo Pachini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e7a600925141354c014ee5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonardo Romoli","original_name":"Leonardo Romoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c394ee7c3a368086d460d78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1981578","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WWDb2kqz9ARIFeQHM2WgQVMYjp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
