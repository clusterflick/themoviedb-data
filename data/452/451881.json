Usually seen in villainous roles, Dumbrille herein offers a sincere, effective performance as a scrupulously honest US marshal named Nightlander. When he takes on a gang of crooked gamblers, Nightlander is shot down in cold blood, compelling frontier doctor John Poole (Johnny Mack Brown) to put his Hippocratic oath on the back burner and strap on the shootin' irons.","popularity":1.1284,"poster_path":"/959amucieFKRkBWioD7yzNFsV3E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram
