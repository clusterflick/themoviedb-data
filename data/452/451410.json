Chip Armstrong, a hot-shot public relations man, quits the employ of Hugo Niles and goes to work for Gray, persuading Mary to enter the Miss America contest at Atlantic City, with the intention of using her to endorse her father's cold cream should she win. Mary breaks her engagement with Horace. When it appears that she will win the contest, Hugo lures her home on the pretext that her father is ill, and she misses the contest. Chip and Mary return to Atlantic City, discovering that the new Miss America has told the world that she owes all her success to Gray's cold cream. On this note, Chip and Mary decide to get married.","popularity":0.5344,"poster_path":"/tP7qKAI9sk4zpkyyLEiKxYkIh0k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Venus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Ralston","original_name":"Esther Ralston","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/1QFncrZpSppxeYKVByF4Jl8w9Xc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mary Gray","credit_id":"58eaa12dc3a36872ee07fa64","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Gray","original_name":"Lawrence Gray","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/bDBFtxbeS9FY5SQk3weSEuOmrAk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chip Armstrong","credit_id":"58eaa161925141351f03f169","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ford Sterling","original_name":"Ford Sterling","popularity":0.2488,"profile_path":"/jWwCuNR2eRpgxlRBKNTCTmCVHP0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hugo Niles","credit_id":"58eaa182925141354c0402eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay Lanphier","original_name":"Fay Lanphier","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":"/cAv3i3RqxqxJjO5gBFqefg9sDnd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Alabama","credit_id":"58eaa19f925141281007d36f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Brooks","original_name":"Louise Brooks","popularity":0.2995,"profile_path":"/z5SZ8JIMJxdJC0L3uwz0aSzvQfH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Miss Bayport","credit_id":"58eaa1ba925141281007d37e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna May Oliver","original_name":"Edna May Oliver","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/oDIELkMQL43tyPUMyHzsVQ6G4fb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Niles","credit_id":"58eaa1d7c3a36872af072a9d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth MacKenna","original_name":"Kenneth MacKenna","popularity":0.1588,"profile_path":"/inCyD9AJvjzXHzetfWF6VkOrMyt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Horace Niles","credit_id":"58eaa1f392514152ac03056e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Fairbanks Jr.","original_name":"Douglas Fairbanks Jr.","popularity":0.4234,"profile_path":"/jjb8iJ0d419dVP2VTYzjy38FxXV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Triton","credit_id":"58eaa226925141351f03f1d8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Torrence","original_name":"Ernest Torrence","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":"/g1Fhsm1aVrhK4lAW8GUz9w9SzZz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"King Neptune","credit_id":"58eaa23a925141281007d3b4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Stowers","original_name":"Frederick Stowers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eaa29cc3a3687326078424","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041607,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Townsend Martin","original_name":"Townsend Martin","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58eaa2d6c3a3684aa406a8eb","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","credit_id":"58eaa2bac3a3684a7906d4d0","department":"Crew","job":"Title Graphics"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Tuttle","original_name":"Frank Tuttle","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/nHq1loTuTtQs416Koylh91hspNk.jpg","credit_id":"58eaa2839251414b28038f38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"J.
