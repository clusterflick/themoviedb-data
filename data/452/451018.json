The Gizmotron® was an attachable device that had the ability to create “authentic sounds of such stringed instruments as violins, violas and cellos,” and maintain “infinite sustain.” It was a remarkable invention by any standards and should have achieved what it said on the can and made much moolah for its inventors. Sadly, it hasn’t yet. However, it was (unfortunately) part of the reason why 10cc split-up in 1976.\r 01 - Silly Love\r 02 - Wall Street Shuffle\r 03 - Baron Samedi\r 04 - Old Wild Men\r 05 - Oh Effendi\r 06 - Fresh Air For My Mama\r 07 - Rubber Bullets","popularity":0.1388,"poster_path":"/iHBMs2NR6Z9Gpyb0ur63IlT4bwM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 CC In Concert - London – BBC 1974","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Godley","original_name":"Kevin Godley","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/dvmu8WvSlhQQhA1B4e6IRxF3n8W.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"drums, percussion, vocals","credit_id":"58e7613c925141281004ffc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lol Creme","original_name":"Lol Creme","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/AhdFn4AQzR9FlqCKwarwRlUJfAf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"guitar, keyboards, vocals","credit_id":"58e76165c3a3684aa403faa9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Stewart","original_name":"Eric Stewart","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/ul1yzWYjGEIzlXNb746Y15kGTK8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"guitar, keyboards, vocals","credit_id":"58e76186c3a368732604da1b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Gouldman","original_name":"Graham Gouldman","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/pKgHBkBYJbuMIK34iZkJVEbxms.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"bass, vocals","credit_id":"58e761a692514127ec0547fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Burgess","original_name":"Paul Burgess","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"drums, moog","credit_id":"58e761c3c3a368731a052be1","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5j0NsWeWYHyvNQdE2AOtr71QSMf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grbvJo4O7v5tKvRXHe2BFXwMcjh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nlYoLR7z2ZT58D3iOzFdmPXzf9v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x4KdZ6afrnO4LPSg2PwFQDUQX73.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7R3g87pBUEKzNuOzTTsREkFeVfV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8lgdpU8GXhmVCj5SuDrSNM5woCx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cSMhcOb1ghWg3C4DT6LMtM6a3Rl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iHBMs2NR6Z9Gpyb0ur63IlT4bwM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"10CC - BBC in concert -1974 part 1","key":"o5u11KbiQV4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-06-19T22:08:06.000Z","id":"5eb9a165511d09001fd4d594"}]}}}
