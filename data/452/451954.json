While emptying the attic, Agnès found pieces of 9.5 mm film, dry and folded, almost broken and two small cardboard figures. The film was impossible to project and the film had to be remade. Showing the pieces of film to Jacques he immediately identified La Ballerine.  A student from the Fine Arts School of Nantes therefore redrew each shot, frame by frame, on blank 16 mm film.","popularity":0.177,"poster_path":"/u55KAMBuwzcrun4Z8xBPTBJfZtV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1944-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Ballerine","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Demy","original_name":"Jacques Demy","popularity":0.4451,"profile_path":"/qfCV7ckQ2XjsAgDRzvJ2PCRAzAE.jpg","credit_id":"58ef6344c3a368263300bdcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Demy","original_name":"Jacques Demy","popularity":0.4451,"profile_path":"/qfCV7ckQ2XjsAgDRzvJ2PCRAzAE.jpg","credit_id":"58ef635b92514141fb00c9c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Demy","original_name":"Jacques Demy","popularity":0.4451,"profile_path":"/qfCV7ckQ2XjsAgDRzvJ2PCRAzAE.jpg","credit_id":"58ef6373c3a368266b00b29f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/u55KAMBuwzcrun4Z8xBPTBJfZtV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fb5JxLIUcMl4bjB83sUm3H3wZSv.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
