The disease has exaggerated Toms nervous energy and in his manic state he suddenly decides to go to Glasgow to visit the family he hasn't seen in ten years. His brother Ian is thoroughly disgusted by his lifestyle and only his mother shows any compassion for him. The visit soon develops into a nightmare as dementia sets in and Tom's health rapidly declines. Finally, events come to a head and Ira has no choice but to force Tom back to London, where he expects him to die at any time. After treatment, Tom gets a brief reprieve, having discovered that his real family is his adopted one in London.","popularity":1.0812,"poster_path":"/dXjjchkahHkZFtWQHxqBMy8P4B3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chronicling the ups and downs that a gay couple experience as their love is almost destroyed by one partnerâ€™s AIDS suffering.","title":"Nervous Energy","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Molina","original_name":"Alfred Molina","popularity":1.8711,"profile_path":"/nJo91Czesn6z0d0pkfbDoVZY3sg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ira","credit_id":"58ea4c1d92514134eb03c992","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cal MacAninch","original_name":"Cal MacAninch","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/1kdmHGHocP4bZvzh11FODZlieob.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"58ea4c2692514152ac02b657","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":200332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McGlynn","original_name":"John McGlynn","popularity":0.3052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ian","credit_id":"58ea4c2dc3a3687326073a8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":992504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siobhan Redmond","original_name":"Siobhan Redmond","popularity":0.7519,"profile_path":"/sxWG5sNKmjKgCCGpiK6ZI3sLKyo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Joyce","credit_id":"58ea4c359251412810078913","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Crosbie","original_name":"Annette Crosbie","popularity":0.4505,"profile_path":"/1ZuyTZbVJRfJ6HxxHL0XcL9GKYo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tom's Mother","credit_id":"58ea4c3d9251412819076d67","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Brady","original_name":"Joseph Brady","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/pIFi1tKPJQ1vUBDzpR0iibwTHb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tom's Father","credit_id":"66d48a8e5f5945e06845954e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Stewart","original_name":"Jean Stewart","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea4bf4c3a3684aa4065e49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1792718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard Schuman","original_name":"Howard Schuman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea4c10925141351f03a5f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64175,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Scott","original_name":"Ann Scott","popularity":0.079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647dc2c20fb39801180e6cfc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113955","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dXjjchkahHkZFtWQHxqBMy8P4B3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
