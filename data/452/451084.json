After surviving two decades of war, Saadiq, 17, and Sa’ad, 19, the team’s most promising stars, enter the only televised match of the year hoping scouts will be watching. With passports of no value on the world stage, soccer may be their only shot to escape a growing terror threat, persecution and poverty. Against the backdrop of fear and shared sacrifice, they embark on separate but equally improbable journeys. In the opportunity of a lifetime, Saadiq sets off for America with dreams of an education and a soccer career. Sa’ad continues his career in Mogadishu with the hopes of someday being reunited with his friend. Their biggest dream is shared – to be symbols of hope to generations who have only known war.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/ymb3hmp7E9C1NpO3yuBNK1xqK6T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224680,"logo_path":null,"name":"2728 Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DJ","name":"Djibouti"},{"iso_3166_1":"SO","name":"Somalia"}],"release_date":"2017-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men in the Arena","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.R.
