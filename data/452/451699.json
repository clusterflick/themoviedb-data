Mirco Kuball: an ultra-wealthy, flamboyant, sophisticated and outspoken man who just happens to have down’s syndrome. This touching film explores an unexpected life. It moves through the castle where he lives; the massage parlours and restaurants where he's indulged; and the theater where he performs. But, beneath the opulent showman, lies a man like any other, who realises that beyond shelter, food, and companionship, nothing else counts.","popularity":0.1547,"poster_path":"/6NC1NnueQvHvsmZHdpx7DsyfX85.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Fortune","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirsten Burger","original_name":"Kirsten Burger","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ed12b792514134eb063906","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1794099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikko Gaestel","original_name":"Mikko Gaestel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ed12cec3a3684aa408995a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1794100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Müller","original_name":"Johannes Müller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ed12e492514152ac052488","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6195212","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6NC1NnueQvHvsmZHdpx7DsyfX85.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"AP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
