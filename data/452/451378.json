The unfortunate death of a wild hare turns into a remarkable experience for children who find his body and bury it in a sand box. Now buried, the hare’s life fades away and dozens of magical creatures that lived inside him leave his body in search for a new home. The hare’s life ends by merging with nature, but is reborn in the plants and animals around it. This fairy-tale for children encourages us to think about what death is.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":"/jUd0afLHKwzjOxuz2PWEWP6XOXv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petpunk","origin_country":""},{"id":97050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitelight","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2017-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
