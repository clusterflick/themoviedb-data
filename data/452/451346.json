While she stares at half filled glasses on the table sound replaces her gaze. Harmonic tones exude and induce a trance like state over the woman. Her meditative harmonies are disrupted when an ominous character arrives with the intent to ingest the song. After consuming the beauty the dark character leaves. Left alone, the adolescent woman employs thaumaturgy to lure her song back to life again.","popularity":0.1811,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Encounter","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1792661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuula Benivolski","original_name":"Yuula Benivolski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/mRQVfw3msYAj1hs8WSN59jekzxW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Yuula","credit_id":"58ea3b00c3a36872ee079c3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663791,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Faye Mullen","original_name":"Faye Mullen","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Faye","credit_id":"58ea3b119251412810077925","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3b2c9251412810077943","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3b5f925141354c03a73b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3b96c3a36872f607469c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792516,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Geoffrey Pugen","original_name":"Geoffrey Pugen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3beec3a368731a079fc7","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3b729251412810077994","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3b82c3a36872ee079cc0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3ba7c3a3687326072c2a","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426724,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Third","original_name":"Tom Third","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3bda92514134eb03b9d1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3b45c3a3687326072bda","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Pye","original_name":"Nicholas Pye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ea3bb6c3a36872af06d72c","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1931563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181235,"name":"color"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
