On board, among the hundreds of Italian immigrants crammed into third class, there are two brothers from Campania who have escaped poverty and are seeking fortune in the New World: Pasquale and Gaetano Segreto. Their younger brother Alfonso, who will join them in 1898 with a Pathé camera, will be one of the pioneers of Cinema, the first to shoot films in Brazil. In a short time, at first selling newspapers and living by their wits, the brothers will become successful entrepreneurs, founding newspapers, amusement parks, cinemas and theatres. But their relationship, over the years, will slowly crumble. After Pasquale's death, a huge fire will definitively put an end to their dream and their empire.","popularity":0.0513,"poster_path":"/64r2ilazzHtQrKConvv6tj9zK5k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157170,"logo_path":"/n9236nSKEWylfvmZ0T3NITgTUcT.png","name":"Stayblack Productions","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":100614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bang Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"I fratelli Segreto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Manzolini","original_name":"Michele Manzolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p6kWxdqyVhPkiVkdNXw6Fi2sBeL.jpg","credit_id":"65aa33526af8f8012cbe6555","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","original_name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77b72466a55112728384b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2128986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Fantastica Valmori","original_name":"Maria Fantastica Valmori","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77abae72f60481caa8e97","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","original_name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77b847d739ff29e9eddc7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"66b77a60d00666c92ca7b5d4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cristiane Soares","original_name":"Cristiane Soares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77a7956eb0a0514017f8c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877915,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Coplon","original_name":"Jonathan Coplon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77be32b2252fa11aa8f43","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"66b77a40dbb4700ee5ba315c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Manzolini","original_name":"Michele Manzolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p6kWxdqyVhPkiVkdNXw6Fi2sBeL.jpg","credit_id":"66b77a547785ad5394261d81","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877912,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Udi Florião","original_name":"Udi Florião","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77aec7f880eccc99edf97","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877914,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patricia Pamplona","original_name":"Patricia Pamplona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77b9cd50d9a643976e0e0","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1697515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliana de Carvalho","original_name":"Juliana de Carvalho","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b77bfe2b2252fa11aa8f46","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386741,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luís Abramo","original_name":"Luís Abramo","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67549aeaff6ba70e5322e7f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/64r2ilazzHtQrKConvv6tj9zK5k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1173}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
