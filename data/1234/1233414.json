For the first time, a seven-year investigation is being carried out into the history of the Jewish deaf under Nazism. It began in 1993, with a debate organized at the Bagnolet library, which showed that the deaf, gagged by their inability to speak, were unable to testify. Numerous testimonies, interspersed with images of the places where sterilizations took place (Hadamar hospital, Berlin...) and the Auschwitz museum, support this discussion. Historians such as Horst Biesold, a specialist in the problem of the deaf under Nazism, break the silence, unmasking the perverse logic of the Nazi regime in terms of racial hygiene and the annihilation of the disabled, and denounce the crucial role played by doctors in this sinister process.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8XgPLNKOgfJTpNGry9Gnoh6WXVd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Témoins sourds, témoins silencieux","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4489364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Gatti","original_name":"Stéphane Gatti","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa9fa66af8f80135be808e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4453833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigitte Lemaine","original_name":"Brigitte Lemaine","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa9fae68afd6013050dcb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1343066","wikidata_id":"Q22000643","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8XgPLNKOgfJTpNGry9Gnoh6WXVd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
