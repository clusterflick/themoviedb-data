The year is 1993. Also in attendance is Cherie, a Black lesbian naval officer who is Peter’s best friend. The two listen sympathetically to Peter’s complaints about how his “Christian” family has abandoned him until a nurse arrives to give Peter medication. While waiting in the hospital cafeteria, Adam and Cherie, meeting that day for he first time, compare notes about the course of Peter’s illness. This leads them to a terrible discovery. Adam, in particular, is confronted with a choice that, while still in shock, he doesn’t know how to handle.","popularity":0.5244,"poster_path":"/uTyzVf5y3bQPbMwmDEru8F3UpKh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If you knew, what would you CHOOSE?","title":"The Knowing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2035137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Perry","original_name":"Jack Perry","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/tkUJ9Vm41Xw95KISGrLbUM2fJmQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65ab3aab7f6c8d012906720a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2356874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Me'lisa Sellers","original_name":"Me'lisa Sellers","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":"/30YOllycNQubxKjAQulGmTlPCHL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65ab3ab1945d360137d05c00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deon L.
