The city is savagely bombed from the air by a battalion of fascist troops. During the bombardment, Republican artillery shoots down an Italian plane. The pilot manages to parachute very close to a village inhabited by three women. Badly wounded on the ground, he is going to be finished off by one of them, Ikerne. This one, however, feels disturbed by the man's presence, and in a purely impulsive act she decides to take him to the house's barn. The presence of the man in the house reveals the lethargic desire of the three women. But it will also bring out the small conflicts and contradictions that the harsh survival conditions in the house have generated. The solution finds its way between desire for man and hatred for the enemy.","popularity":0.1135,"poster_path":"/bZo7LLXiiIYnF2gqU860in7trFp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lauburu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538560,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luis Ángel Ramírez","original_name":"Luis Ángel Ramírez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9836fb0cd2001361786e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0336732","wikidata_id":"Q12262007","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bZo7LLXiiIYnF2gqU860in7trFp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
