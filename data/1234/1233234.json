Anyone who breaks the rules and falls in love is punished on their 25th birthday by shedding their human status and being transformed into a plant or animal of their choice. Transfiguration abolishes the historicity of the human body and the limits imposed upon it, as man puts on the body of the species into which he was transfigured and acquires the status and eternity of the species into which he was transfigured.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/z3anhwvxe4BL5EBMJ5rMUfAOS8H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ear of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4258500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Sotiriou","original_name":"Christina Sotiriou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65aa1c635346610138cd315a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3912736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrysanthi Theodosi","original_name":"Chrysanthi Theodosi","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65aa1c69c433ea00c8747cb5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sokratis Romilios","original_name":"Sokratis Romilios","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa1c39b0cd20013017c447","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sokratis Romilios","original_name":"Sokratis Romilios","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa1c41b0cd20012717c630","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30459505","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z3anhwvxe4BL5EBMJ5rMUfAOS8H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
