The meditation is guided by Dhātu-Ba'dan*, a spiritual healer named after an ancient Himyarite goddess of the oasis and worshiped at tree-circled pools. Dhātu-Ba'dan was said to forbid any invocation to her without a priestess in her sanctuary, employing a khalimah (i.e. 'Dreamer') who would sleep to receive an oracle in the form of a prophetic dream. Today, tarot card readers take on this mediating role, inhabiting the damp, leaky corners of the web and using network technology to mediate the relationship with their earnest followers.","popularity":0.0372,"poster_path":"/5q1Pr5kXDxF10mly84tXhkctZ5G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"vista in the sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rojda Yavuz","original_name":"Rojda Yavuz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa4e525cea18012ec1413e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruba Al Sweel","original_name":"Ruba Al Sweel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa4e45357c0000c2d6c030","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shamiran Istifan","original_name":"Shamiran Istifan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa4e5d6af8f80129be6807","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5q1Pr5kXDxF10mly84tXhkctZ5G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
