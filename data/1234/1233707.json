Begun by Mary Whitehouse against the homosexual newspaper Gay News, it ended in a conviction, heavy fines and a suspended prison sentence for the editor. An appeal is pending. Was this prosecution an attack on free speech? Or was it a necessary defence of the principle that, even in a permissive society, some things must remain sacred?  This dramatised documentary reconstructs the crucial moments of this historic trial, and explores the issues it raises.  Peter France questions the people on both sides, including Mary Whitehouse and Denis Lemon, Editor, Gay News, about their actions and reactions during the case.","popularity":0.8821,"poster_path":"/7nSq88PCQweY9RrUTt4h4qlcsQT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blasphemy at the Old Bailey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Eccles","original_name":"Donald Eccles","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":"/y9yXhQXmzMCbbyhF9BDRQuy7cYw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"His Honour Judge King-Hamilton, QC","credit_id":"65abca9098f1f10126df2869","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Rodway","original_name":"Norman Rodway","popularity":0.575,"profile_path":"/91ICCwFg4Q8kF4ALdWkUz3FY8AV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Mortimer, QC","credit_id":"65abcaa298f1f10127df2b3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terrence Hardiman","original_name":"Terrence Hardiman","popularity":0.3361,"profile_path":"/jbues6vQgKbCOvLdGuktrkNp0iW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Smyth","credit_id":"65abcac485090f00a27dee81","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth Thomas","original_name":"Gareth Thomas","popularity":0.2158,"profile_path":"/vm7Z8E1jwqIItLsiuJy2Dk10gVt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"G.
