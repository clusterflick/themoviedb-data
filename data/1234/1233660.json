Everyone in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, lives in one of three oases. The southern oasis, home to the cities of San Rafael and General Alvear, depends primarily on The Atuel River. Yet incredulously, the river remains under threat.  People cannot care for what they don’t know and so we decided to ask the river what story it would like to tell about itself. To do so, we travelled its entire length from its source in the heart of The Andes to where it dries out prematurely in the sands of The Cuyo Desert. We’re told we are the first to do so since 1884 and the first ever to do so by boat.  43 days. 480 kilometres. 38 people interviewed about their relationship with the river.","popularity":0.1671,"poster_path":"/m8k2uCLFb2QdjgfSclWpvb7kIKe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218824,"logo_path":null,"name":"The 12.01 Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atuel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Cook","original_name":"Benjamin Cook","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ab965498f1f10126df1ca7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490571,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Heistein","original_name":"Pierre Heistein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ab96a2aaec7100a3a44b17","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariana Bollati","original_name":"Mariana Bollati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ab96b2aaec7100a1a44aef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490573,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"G Vaughan","original_name":"G Vaughan","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ab96d7a843c100bbb6a485","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Benjamin cook","original_name":"Benjamin cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ab96eebe6d8800bc927d90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27689485","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A9iLcuU04qSUl0oNJZyxmSNGftx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2038}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1680,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m8k2uCLFb2QdjgfSclWpvb7kIKe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":322942,"name":"adventure"},{"id":327654,"name":"atuel"},{"id":327655,"name":"mendoza"},{"id":327656,"name":"the 12.01 project"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Atuel Trailer (English Subs, 4K)","key":"s4zGYDZGWsI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-08T00:50:01.000Z","id":"65ab9827be6d8800bc927df2"}]}}}
