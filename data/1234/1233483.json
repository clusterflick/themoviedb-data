An African woman stands beside a sign which reads 'David Livingstone cut his initials on this tree in 1855'. On the shores of the Zambesi river, two Africans remove a large branch, before the film shows a European standing on the rocks splashing his feet in the water. By the riverÂ¿s edge, there are a number of canoes, which locals row. Some Europeans board and are shown travelling along the river. There follows a succession of shots of the Victoria Falls - from different angles and positions - including a shot of the Victoria Bridge and the swirling water in the gorge.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GREAT VICTORIA FALLS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
