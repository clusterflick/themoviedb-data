A device was made that allowed the camera to rotate around a horizontal axis. The resulting film is a 360 degree rotation of the studio in a vertical direction. This is somewhat analogous to the way the film passes through the camera. The film was first shown in the 5th Avenue space in downtown San Diego. The installation forced the audience to view the film over a six foot wall. The film was projected near the ceiling on a wall at the rear of the space The film is about the way the camera describes space and the control of the way the viewer is oriented to the film projection.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dV6Yd2MUQCYo217iiLAZlhbvZ4A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vertical Room Pan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Haxton","original_name":"David Haxton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/o4UOTzv5WxfhExqmos7h6q45g1Z.jpg","credit_id":"65a9ae7bb0cd200127178ea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dV6Yd2MUQCYo217iiLAZlhbvZ4A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
