From his early childhood, to playing high school sports, and ultimately becoming a father/husband/grandfather. It is the life progression of a young, superb athlete and all-around active man to an older individual, facing a horrible medical condition that is slowly shutting down his brain and his ability to move.  Using my grandfather’s story as a reference, I would like to reflect on the lessons that he has taught me as someone who was diagnosed with a chronic illness in 2022. Specifically, the humor that he exudes or how to enjoy the small things when you are facing hard times.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ogtwMSSEehNRDcilneets7zpU8U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Using my grandfather’s battle with Parkinson's disease, I would like to reflect on the lessons that he has taught me as someone who was diagnosed with a chronic illness in 2022.","title":"Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4489556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Martin","original_name":"Bill Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"65aab72ac433ea00c874a396","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4489558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Twomey","original_name":"Julie Twomey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Actress","credit_id":"65aab7357caa47012509863c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Twomey","original_name":"Ryan Twomey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aa1b3468afd6013350be6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ogtwMSSEehNRDcilneets7zpU8U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Yuv7A4k5dzFyn0SYbzL8UIS37F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
