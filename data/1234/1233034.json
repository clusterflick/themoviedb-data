In the heart of winter, a group of Innu and non-Innu adventurers attempt to cross this vast mountain range on snowshoes, completely independently. Faced with the vastness of the territory, the rigors of the northern climate and the impetuous breath of the tundra, they discover each other in a different way, form friendships and unite to better chart their course. Over the kilometres, the adventure reveals a space for meeting, sharing and reconciliation.","popularity":0.2744,"poster_path":"/u5jHvgIH79S8H9V3lhChOuQoQLc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161289,"logo_path":"/aNzDGX4GQAPo6SPME4woxpmffmf.png","name":"Arc'teryx","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":210205,"logo_path":"/b8tj1y9mHbOgvhrETQlhvlgrMtx.png","name":"Post-Moderne","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":218723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société géographique royale du Canada","origin_country":""},{"id":24726,"logo_path":"/4Ou4PZ9hiEJyICZxk6FfydGIOfb.png","name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uapishka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","original_name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/njcdPhb86d36EJIsAodbKpZJkY0.jpg","credit_id":"65a99317e267de0128a2c11b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","original_name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/njcdPhb86d36EJIsAodbKpZJkY0.jpg","credit_id":"65a9932b357c0000cbd67262","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488026,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-Pierre Demers","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a99351d9542000cf20fede","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488024,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Béland","original_name":"David Béland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a993365346610131ccf3ec","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646493,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ilyaa Ghafouri","original_name":"Ilyaa Ghafouri","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a993606af8f8012cbe20e6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488025,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marc-André Bilodeau","original_name":"Marc-André Bilodeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a99346e267de012ea2c016","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820034,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steven Mercier","original_name":"Steven Mercier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9936ec4ad5900d4965115","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","original_name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/njcdPhb86d36EJIsAodbKpZJkY0.jpg","credit_id":"65a993225346610133ccf395","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646493,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ilyaa Ghafouri","original_name":"Ilyaa Ghafouri","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9937ab0cd20012a17890d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pD0pcxb7edE4eXA4bqqtt3e2OdV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u5jHvgIH79S8H9V3lhChOuQoQLc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":3356,"name":"quebec"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":303675,"name":"cote-nord"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Avant-première","release_date":"2023-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
