Her decision to move to France and to marry director Yves Ciampi in 1957 – after he filmed her in Typhoon Over Nagasaki starring Jean Marais and Danielle Darrieux – caused a huge scandal in Japan.  Despite this transgression, Keiko Kishi continued acting in her home country with Kon Ichikawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Masaki Kobayashi… building unique bridges between Japanese and European cultures. Free and rebellious, she emancipated herself from the many obstacles she encountered in the film industry, and created her own production company in her early twenties.  Let’s look back at the story of a pioneer, an inspiration for many generations.","popularity":0.9337,"poster_path":"/lyFcDMKEoSNdQSFrgeKl4zTHZ87.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36713,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paper Moon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keiko Kishi, Eternally Rebellious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Kishi","original_name":"岸恵子","popularity":0.6561,"profile_path":"/2jSCjRGlI7N3WajaLoqJoia3qAV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65abc5ce85090f00a07deb1a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal-Alex Vincent","original_name":"Pascal-Alex Vincent","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/nLrfo7ZdlUDL3rLnIbSyWqLGGru.jpg","credit_id":"65abc59c99d5c300bb7ccfe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30877920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1250,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lyFcDMKEoSNdQSFrgeKl4zTHZ87.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":833}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":6165,"name":"historical figure"},{"id":3993,"name":"inspiration"},{"id":18447,"name":"japanese woman"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":234957,"name":"celebrity interview"},{"id":239463,"name":"film archives"},{"id":318336,"name":"famous actress"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Lumière","release_date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ciné+ Classic","release_date":"2024-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
