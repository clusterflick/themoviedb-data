There, something unexpected happened : an authentic encounter, with no beating around the bush, no mask. From a few existential questions –about life, painting, death- thruth emerged. The artist died of cancer in December 2004 before Jennifer could film him again. After inheriting his studio, she found herself in this sacred space, still imbued with the presence and imagination of her father. Her film is an attempt to prolong the dialogue, to find the missing fragments of her father’s life. Edmund Alleyn was an intense and complex man of integrity who left his mark on Canadian art history.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/6MhT2R8NCfnKvyJT9Ic6phubTyj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father's Studio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Alleyn","original_name":"Jennifer Alleyn","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":"/rdINQfN9sc7IwqXRXh2u4JKLXyL.jpg","credit_id":"65ab2784c433ea00c574cb0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1611929","wikidata_id":"Q3202513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6MhT2R8NCfnKvyJT9Ic6phubTyj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIFA 2008 - Montréal","release_date":"2008-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
