Their arrival in the country was one of the local Jewish community's first ever encounters with a group of Holocaust survivors on a scale so large. Through archive footage and the children's video testimonials (who, at the time of filming, were already adults), a light is at last shone on the far lesser known tale of 'the children of Tehran' - yet another piece of the chilling puzzle that is the memory of the Holocaust. This film is the only documentation of this heroic affair.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Tehran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23836790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
