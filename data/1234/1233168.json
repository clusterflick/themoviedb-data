The trick of the heist is that, in order to create a false trail, they disguise themselves as men.

In this process, they reach their emotional and physical limits and repeatedly fail to imitate male connoted behavior.","popularity":0.3148,"poster_path":"/lmcB7hVCeYZjzipYWOvpMcHImz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lemonade Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2024-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Robbers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristin Lerch","original_name":"Kristin Lerch","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Agnes","credit_id":"65a9e5a3357c0000c7d69d0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3846249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thea Ehre","original_name":"Thea Ehre","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"65a9e5aeb0cd20012d17adcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Medusa","credit_id":"65a9e5bbb0cd20013617b6d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3770348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Wild","original_name":"Florian Wild","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sepp","credit_id":"65a9e5c30c4c1600c57b6529","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Wintersteiger","original_name":"Daniel Wintersteiger","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mayer","credit_id":"65a9e5ccc433ea00d2746703","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9e5605cea180131c1195e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9e58c6af8f8012fbe47b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4488495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Schieche","original_name":"Isa Schieche","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9e57cd9542000d42122a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Katharina Pichler","original_name":"Katharina Pichler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a22aab1bc70164a8e584","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581661,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alba R.
