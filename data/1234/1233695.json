The music video for Céline Dion’s chartbuster My Heart Will Go On (1997) is manipulated and scored to Blind Willie Johnson’s gospel song God Moves on the Water (1929). Instead of an ode to eternal love, Dion now sings praise of God’s implacable wrath.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sfEaK2C3umV15ttwx59Zs9QbByK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Moves on the Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Bünger","original_name":"Erik Bünger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abc1a91f3e6000a0feac75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sfEaK2C3umV15ttwx59Zs9QbByK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
