At seventeen, with his schooling over and his future uncertain, he lives with his widower father (Gunnar Lemvigh) and sister (Annegrethe Nissen) in a crumbling, characterless part of London which has nothing to offer save despair. With his father contemplating a second marriage and trying to steer him into some kind of secure employment, Harvey's dreams seem remote and beyond fulfillment.","popularity":0.4476,"poster_path":"/w5YY7jqIfEwsbEZm6qBfqzfvoL8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42155,"logo_path":null,"name":"DR TV-Teatret","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alle I Unge Elskende","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baard Owe","original_name":"Baard Owe","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/gi316TYhHTV1EBnsRyouv1hhLUv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harvey Green","credit_id":"5e7348fc357c0000194a2cbc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":537019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Hansen","original_name":"Benny Hansen","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/1Pzs7nZXLrCPY16gsJJZPiIhSZR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65f70696242f940164cc1969","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lone Hertz","original_name":"Lone Hertz","popularity":0.2305,"profile_path":"/tddR5u4LleypCf5gz273L5YQwKJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65f706a4ef9d72017ed58b3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1066792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annegrethe Nissen","original_name":"Annegrethe Nissen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65f706b0242f94014acb95f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunnar Lemvigh","original_name":"Gunnar Lemvigh","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/wQse7YrLCLJyUp1swxt7FiLDTcq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65f706bbae3843017d4a64a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Else-Marie Juul Hansen","original_name":"Else-Marie Juul Hansen","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/f1YOmAYADnKd40zEFvrv5dEGLOy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65f706cbe194b00149bd9454","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":578973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Henrik Krause","original_name":"Hans-Henrik Krause","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/dPocBlyu07amIEd2MUfUdAROf6p.jpg","credit_id":"5e7348b0b1f68d0019dff0f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1570084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1123,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r7NtN324ghf0kKAJzmNYvGDYtNv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1946,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w5YY7jqIfEwsbEZm6qBfqzfvoL8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1318}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
