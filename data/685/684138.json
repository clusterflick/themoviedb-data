Her newfound courage helps her obtain the job of her dreams as a Junior Copywriter on a temporary basis. Just when life couldn't get better, she falls hard for a client, French VP of PR, Desmond. Although opposites, the two become closer as strange secrets seem to spill from Desmond's lips. As Samantha keeps blogging, her career and love life blossom; until her blog is discovered by an evil co-worker. Unbeknown to her, the blog becomes an underground smash hit with her entire office! Will she be able to stop her blog before her newfound love finds out?
