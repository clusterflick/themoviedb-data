The film addresses some of the deepest and most distressing issues Māori communities face, and shows how extraordinary creative solutions are being provided by Māori communities themselves. Mita asks Maori men to front up to some grim realities by talking openly and honestly about the violence and abuse that has plagued their communities for many years. The film is a personal response to this violence, with Mita making a case for a return to an older model of Maori manhood, when men were the ones who sweetly sang the children to sleep. “Merata intended the documentary to count in ways that mattered deeply to her and to change perceptions of abuse and violence by using themes of responsibility, redemption, revitalisation, forgiveness and, most of all, love.” - Carol Hirschfeld, Māori Television.","popularity":0.1741,"poster_path":"/iLjW7WHvomM8yDCLwAJcCXPdjha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ora digital","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2011-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saving Grace - Te Whakarauora Tangata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"Te Whakarauora Tangata","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"Saving Grace","type":"English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Curtis","original_name":"Cliff Curtis","popularity":1.7989,"profile_path":"/3D6qz8vL6DWHAO3HeXeaSuwxq3s.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e713f2d4f9a990017535c16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hone Kaa","original_name":"Hone Kaa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e713f37b1f68d0019dba938","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103405,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rewa Harre","original_name":"Rewa Harre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e713eed4f9a990017535bc3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1671910,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Desray Armstrong","original_name":"Desray Armstrong","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/bUtDWmARmR0M8T9ksKOOBsk532u.jpg","credit_id":"5e713f062f3b170017480e3d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67118,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annie Collins","original_name":"Annie Collins","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e713ef7357c0000194754c7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1409486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chelsea Winstanley","original_name":"Chelsea Winstanley","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e713edb4083b30017959e65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dick Reade","original_name":"Dick Reade","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e713f118de0ae001554e98f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","credit_id":"5e713eb8aaf897001363fb1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Curtis","original_name":"Cliff Curtis","popularity":1.7989,"profile_path":"/3D6qz8vL6DWHAO3HeXeaSuwxq3s.jpg","credit_id":"5e713ec74083b30017959e50","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merata Mita","original_name":"Merata Mita","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/t9D9XASTbaHkZ7ySgFF0KH3vTNB.jpg","credit_id":"5e713ed0cabfe40015182e83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2764060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iLjW7WHvomM8yDCLwAJcCXPdjha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"imagineNATIVE Film Festival","release_date":"2011-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
