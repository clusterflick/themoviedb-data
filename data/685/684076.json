Desperate people who do not know what to do next might hit their heads against walls. This is not always literal. It is more often a metaphor for not knowing how to get around a strong sense of frustration. But if we observe this movement as an instrument, a hopeless action begins to transform into an absurd repetition. In the compositions, my head is played as instrument in multiple contradictory locations and creates an audiovisual urban \"landscape\" of the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7lPfjdeWGhgOHGzbW8eVdHGh0AJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitting My Head On The World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2387675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Vasof","original_name":"Anna Vasof","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6391ea30647654008cc99c1f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2569524,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heinz Riegler","original_name":"Heinz Riegler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e715c614f9a990011539f96","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2387675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Vasof","original_name":"Anna Vasof","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7279e68de0ae001356ed1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2387675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Vasof","original_name":"Anna Vasof","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7279f98de0ae001356ed25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1427,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7lPfjdeWGhgOHGzbW8eVdHGh0AJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
