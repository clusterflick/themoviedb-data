Despite the difficulties, the films continue to exist and to resist. Is it worth it? What would happen if they disappeared? Each viewer must find their answer. This film aims to be an approach to Portuguese cinema in its hundred years of existence, opening, hopefully, ways for their dissemination and making light for its knowledge.","popularity":0.1468,"poster_path":"/a9hcoJXrXtt3oyFkFk59aJIPdWF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16421,"logo_path":"/A5ZNlCF9yzcIqmvD8WQtHK9htg8.png","name":"Rosa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Português? - Diálogos com João Bénard da Costa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Bénard da Costa","original_name":"João Bénard da Costa","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/vZp41JHkRrE9U20R5hYhbejEkwi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e74030c2f3b1700114d4c46","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Mozos","original_name":"Manuel Mozos","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/9pKKGBhU9gKwmdsBBt4rLJdDWh0.jpg","credit_id":"5e7402fdb1f68d0017e03a3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Mozos","original_name":"Manuel Mozos","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/9pKKGBhU9gKwmdsBBt4rLJdDWh0.jpg","credit_id":"5e74031eb1f68d0019e0dc84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquim Sapinho","original_name":"Joaquim Sapinho","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/xBhIXEOu4fMQWrYnXwznDJPc7l3.jpg","credit_id":"5e751084cee2f6001369617d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7795124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a9hcoJXrXtt3oyFkFk59aJIPdWF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
