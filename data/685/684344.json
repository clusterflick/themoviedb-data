She becomes a spy and provides valuable intelligence information during World War I by winning the confidence of a German officer. Hugh Warren is the American soldier who falls for Olympe. She allows him to believe she is a simple peasant and reveals nothing of her career as a spy. The two fall in love and are married, but the villainous German agent De Montinrich reveals to her husband's family that she is a tawdry club dancer. Unable to reveal her role in espionage, Olympe is ostracized by her friends and family. When the French government honors Olympe for her wartime bravery, her family no longer considers her a blemish on their sterling reputation.","popularity":0.2008,"poster_path":"/8ynPGGe4UYeol0NqAXFa4x39eCC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Lives for Old","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Compson","original_name":"Betty Compson","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/wBvlOvaNmxbTYWgiE8iCqop7Psj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Olympe","credit_id":"5e729052b513a800128d6ca6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace MacDonald","original_name":"Wallace MacDonald","popularity":0.357,"profile_path":"/lP3Lxz5EiWYhziMJedbkuzeaQeE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hugh Warren","credit_id":"5e729057b1f68d0019de7e20","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Kosloff","original_name":"Theodore Kosloff","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/pP89GUmPhDgEoCAE0LSsI04WVGb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"De Montinbard","credit_id":"5e72905ef9aa470019d1f2d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheldon Lewis","original_name":"Sheldon Lewis","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/zsgNwtpLXyYSFJU0XeNECvVDlh9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pugin","credit_id":"5e729064b513a800128d6cb4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Joyce","original_name":"Jack Joyce","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jean Bertaut","credit_id":"5e72906ce74146001567a051","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Seddon","original_name":"Margaret Seddon","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/w7kN7GewHnIUm8ypxhMDrwsCs0M.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Widow Turrene","credit_id":"61fecaf5ddd52d00e2bc5b69","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
