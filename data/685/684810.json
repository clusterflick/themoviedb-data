From overwhelming obstacles to unpredictable encounters, their journey soon turns into an organic quest. With silence as a horizon line. And punk as a philosophy, thinking that music is accessible to all and that the human spirit is above the technique.","popularity":0.3784,"poster_path":"/6TBGNdbdqnOXHEBkXKk0UyC0lTR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184355,"logo_path":"/zM5VRTYm17O5WhKH54UAmJNltpJ.png","name":"Dérives","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2020-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How
