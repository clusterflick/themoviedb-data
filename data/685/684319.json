When word arrives of Castleman's death, Chilton prepares to usurp the fortune and property of the dead man. Danny Rowland, who is found wounded by two wandering crooks, Dominie and The Squirrel, opportunely arrives at the estate seeking food and rest; and because of his resemblance to Castleman, he is welcomed as the master. Dominie is introduced as an English cleric and The Squirrel as an Italian count, while Danny falls in love with Jeanne, who believes him to be her fiancé. Chilton, however, suspects the trio and finally unmasks them. It then develops that Danny actually is Castleman, who had decided to reform the two men who befriended him and to expose the dishonesty of his cousin.","popularity":0.1681,"poster_path":"/zjUl15xj3kCWpZNpp777OuCaImN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edwin Carewe Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pals First","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Hughes","original_name":"Lloyd Hughes","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/ejZIGbXs0wObn0e9g7BlDF1JTTz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Richard Castleman / Danny Rowland","credit_id":"5e72874cf9aa470013d198ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores del Río","original_name":"Dolores del Río","popularity":0.4595,"profile_path":"/wH6xClLg5dkaJEgpSneASQrRVZ8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jeanne Lamont","credit_id":"5e728753f9aa470017d1de51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec B.
