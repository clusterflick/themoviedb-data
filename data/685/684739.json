The film explores the tensions that arise when such communities come face to face with the complex institutions responsible for enforcing the law. The result of these tensions is a narrative worthy of Kafka, in which a doorway to justice is opened for the sole purpose of demonstrating that no one can pass through it.","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":"/oBm2AFEnCCGvozbRCPZvYLdASk0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2015-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Matter of Land","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1623022,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gigi Chaves","original_name":"Gigi Chaves","popularity":0.1645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b1f245a3b5e600c50ac5b7","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricia Ayala Ruiz","original_name":"Patricia Ayala Ruiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e743980357c0000164c23c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathalia Chaparro Vega","original_name":"Nathalia Chaparro Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e743a14cabfe400151cbfc0","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2572097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Moreno","original_name":"Aaron Moreno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7439a8a055ef0014299aa9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572096,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patricia Ayala Ruiz","original_name":"Patricia Ayala Ruiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e74398c2f3b1700144d0d65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1625189,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jose Jairo Flores","original_name":"Jose Jairo Flores","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/unIy78kJfGEYnezoKojfOdNg9YT.jpg","credit_id":"5e7439df357c0000194b7066","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489998,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adriana Ángel Hernández","original_name":"Adriana Ángel Hernández","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7439f3cabfe400131e6719","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623069,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Borodovsky","original_name":"Alan Borodovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7439c0f9aa470015d4651a","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2490001,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jose Espinosa Romero","original_name":"Jose Espinosa Romero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e743a03357c0000134c4c2b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4568110","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.686,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/oBm2AFEnCCGvozbRCPZvYLdASk0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":183686,"name":"war context"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
