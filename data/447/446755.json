They have come to find the father of the latter, a Frenchman who was formerly a prisoner in Germany. But she arrives on the very day of his funeral. This unexpected arrival will cause trouble when the young German woman discovers that he had hidden his living conditions in Germany from the whole village, conditions that were not as uncomfortable as he claimed in his letters. Honorin, the mayor, will take in the two foreigners, while the village will be divided between those who are benevolent and those who are opposed to the presence of these two nationals of the former enemy country.","popularity":0.1791,"poster_path":"/AalBmr3humGAcYCLUQKNRJAm60n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Honorin et la Loreleï","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Galabru","original_name":"Michel Galabru","popularity":0.3315,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Honorin, le maire","credit_id":"58c696f3c3a368411401540b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace de Capitani","original_name":"Grace de Capitani","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/dnJ0aQfSdMNcZpKcHC2COQnyUDO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"La Loreleï","credit_id":"58c697089251411d55017610","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Carel","original_name":"Roger Carel","popularity":0.3987,"profile_path":"/nIibRj2FbvhGQqXMrLJJqAsG107.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anselme, le curé","credit_id":"5c7be90c0e0a26521c13f77c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Serres","original_name":"Jacques Serres","popularity":0.1656,"profile_path":"/bCyhqsciYOLwMVZF9RjF1t3xr1q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6268902cfea0d7004f7639d3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Chapot","original_name":"Jean Chapot","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/zTasGeuKjeJ2FFe0zZCFOcQCfNL.jpg","credit_id":"5c7be941c3a3682f031b5d91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0168865","wikidata_id":"Q2412741","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AalBmr3humGAcYCLUQKNRJAm60n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Canal+","release_date":"1992-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
