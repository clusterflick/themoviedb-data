His wife sees the benefits of this gift and urges Diogene to exercise his power, particularly on a wealthy old man, M. Coq. Arlette Leguignon, however, is in love with a young doctor, who is violently opposed to her future father-in-law. Leguignon ends up condemned and, disgusted, no longer wants to look after others. When Mr. Coq dies, making him his legatee, Leguignon has to contend with the Coq family. This time, Doctor Martinet comes to his defense. The inheritance is used to build a clinic where Leguignon can carry out his experiments as a magnetizer.","popularity":0.1614,"poster_path":"/i2296sPGf0GT6GpkJXuaQM5DRBq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jason Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1954-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leguignon the Healer","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Deniaud","original_name":"Yves Deniaud","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/jXiHO7DEVFvvnXC4xbhFBe8y8Vu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Diogène Leguignon","credit_id":"58c523d8c3a3687d2e005e8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Marken","original_name":"Jane Marken","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/f66OSgNKU4PuCtyBEFdZ4niNicD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mme Leguignon","credit_id":"58c523e29251411b52006b70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1042254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Besnard","original_name":"Nicole Besnard","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/omjAJkNpuau5WnGFqko6SnOhR8x.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Arlette Leguignon","credit_id":"58c523eec3a3687d14005c0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Roux","original_name":"Michel Roux","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/4GyXo7pGJaDOpblsFC35P0fMoyr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"58c523fbc3a3687d1e00622d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Brunot","original_name":"André Brunot","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/fkntPxUIA9zOTqobH1pPcruCOzl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Docteur Martinet","credit_id":"58c52407c3a3687cbc006403","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Versini","original_name":"André Versini","popularity":0.1734,"profile_path":"/vPk2BwbBzmp9qTROTqCnMHBsHM3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Thierry Coq","credit_id":"58c524129251411b3a006adc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Blanche","original_name":"Louis Blanche","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6jMjroySBTcNs2EJkGgRnTV587A.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"M.
