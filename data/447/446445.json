At first, Judge Lena Kalbach does not allow the lawsuit - until it turns out that Bergen, as a sperm donor, is the biological father of the child. A delicate case for which Lena has to find a solution with great tact. But she is also personally affected by the issue of fatherhood: Her adult daughter Nike finally wants to know who her father is. In the third part of the popular TV series, Michaela May again plays the smart judge Lena Kalbach.","popularity":0.4573,"poster_path":"/ozlEJryyCQh32VK0ErgJjav2koF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6904,"logo_path":"/hYZGaKXbbpf6KS3slxiglZZj9kL.png","name":"Filmpool
