Paul's gumption restores the Galeries Parisiennes to its former glory, and he gives a farewell present to a more subdued Dominique. He returns to his village, arm in arm with the wise Marie-Louise, ex-saleswoman at the Grand Magasin.","popularity":0.6775,"poster_path":"/pCXyjTklZ4bdS7w4aaJxY1eyt1T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bertho Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orsay Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1953-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Father's Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Richard","original_name":"Jean Richard","popularity":0.2103,"profile_path":"/qnNsKeI9jfSCNFsKeO3B3Yc7bTQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Paul Durand","credit_id":"58c64ff9c3a36840f6011edc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1054071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Philippe","original_name":"Michèle Philippe","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Melle Marie-Louise, la vendeuse du rayon Ameublement Décoration","credit_id":"58c65006c3a3684130011ae7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Bardot","original_name":"Brigitte Bardot","popularity":1.5149,"profile_path":"/xitdKLPSsavii74yGJ73cwMzBOC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dominique Dupond-Durand, la demi-sœur de Paul","credit_id":"58c65011c3a3684114011ab9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":244491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Goya","original_name":"Mona Goya","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lIvazfPsJiZ5De2nQgLpMEcq9UO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mme mère Dupond-Durand","credit_id":"58c65021c3a3684120011d3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Duvallès","original_name":"Frédéric Duvallès","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/nSK3QoYmsiemMoSsahdiTTORJbk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"M.
