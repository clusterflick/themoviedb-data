The film is set during the family's reunion on Vancouver Island and flashes back and forth over the last 10 years. By coincidence, Yoshi who is now a world famous Pianist is giving a concert in Vancouver and Amy is anxious to see him again but her sister curiously is not at all interested. The girls explore old passions, stalking, sibling rivalry and wrong life choice based on the fantasies of their youth.","popularity":0.428,"poster_path":"/fM7NKtabHKPpKmg0VAyNARs4w0P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pianist","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Le Pianiste","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Macha Grenon","original_name":"Macha Grenon","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/pRMEs5E6NOOtlaf9j9TpV7dXdIt.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58c73fbec3a3683dc5002ed2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Alacchi","original_name":"Carl Alacchi","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/gPkHdHNTTPuVasLGUxxVpPRckt0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58c73fd3c3a3683d95002c9f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Allison","original_name":"Ralph Allison","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58c73fe0c3a3683dc5002f01","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothée Berryman","original_name":"Dorothée Berryman","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/zlc88cQfPJuNYCIJC3RYu5L0mVO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58c73fe9c3a3683dc5002f0b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maury Chaykin","original_name":"Maury Chaykin","popularity":0.7065,"profile_path":"/Aqmsu1UHo40Md4RlLGfotSt8Lrr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58c73ffbc3a3683dc5002f29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eiji Okuda","original_name":"奥田瑛二","popularity":0.6399,"profile_path":"/r6fMqhPjBDPMn3oio1a2cjZzsnx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"58c74007c3a3683dd7002cd1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Gagnon","original_name":"Claude Gagnon","popularity":0.175,"profile_path":"/1gn32bW2lyfRJnn4XphxYpG81ui.jpg","credit_id":"58c7403e92514179de003354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0102663","wikidata_id":"Q3522228","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":760,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fM7NKtabHKPpKmg0VAyNARs4w0P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3356,"name":"quebec"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
