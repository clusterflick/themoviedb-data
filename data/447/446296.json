For some, it was the golden age of pleasure and the easy life, with memories of Charleston, short-haired tomboys, wild races in a Torpedo, and the dizzying banks of Deauville. For the rest of us, it was a time of illusions, when the carefree post-war era did little to conceal the profound upheavals that were shaking the world: the Soviet Revolution, the establishment of Fascism in Italy, German rearmament, a changing China, and finally the great economic depression of 1929, which took on the proportions of a global catastrophe.","popularity":0.2052,"poster_path":"/uk8uwJegvuAaERTlBeXK9oKxTyQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mad Years","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Os Anos Loucos","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Hullut vuodet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Ta hronia tis parafrosynis","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Gli anni folli","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Mad Years","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Los locos años veinte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Reggiani","original_name":"Serge Reggiani","popularity":0.2608,"profile_path":"/7URSpmWp6SDIfLhKoPExc2oueet.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Récitant / Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"58c3d92fc3a3681ab6002609","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1774233,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Olivier Grégoire","original_name":"Olivier Grégoire","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3d8d792514134580027ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Etíenne Laroche","original_name":"Etíenne Laroche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3bbf1c3a3681ab60012c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirea Alexandresco","original_name":"Mirea Alexandresco","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3bb92c3a3681ad30011d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Torrent","original_name":"Henri Torrent","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3bba6c3a3681a860012a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618830,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georges Tzipine","original_name":"Georges Tzipine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3d8b1c3a3681ad00021e0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georges Van Parys","original_name":"Georges van Parys","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/zPDR9MXBBO83rL5LDJtKigdQf4n.jpg","credit_id":"58c3d8c5c3a3681a4a0026b1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0140809","wikidata_id":"Q125427839","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uk8uwJegvuAaERTlBeXK9oKxTyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":688}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207876,"name":"1920s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
