It begins in Midwestern America ... but it's more than that. It's the story of every industrial town struggling to find its way in a new age.  This PBS documentary tells a story about how one community in Ohio is trying to adapt to the historic economic crosswinds sweeping the world today. Lima is a town of 45,000 residents in the agriculturally rich northwestern part of the state. Lima's journey, through the 20' century, is a microcosm reflecting many of the economic trends that have effected millions and has reshaped this country.  Lost in Middle America is a discovery process where people help tell the story of Lima through their own personal stories. This is a story of every industrial town struggling to find its way in a new age. It's a story of lost pride, enduring hope, and the strength of the human spirit.","popularity":0.2543,"poster_path":"/y9DyfGEQSUxNFfsPxX0YdIF4xId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in Middle America (and What Happened Next)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Holbrook","original_name":"Hal Holbrook","popularity":0.9126,"profile_path":"/cnhje99hbqldY1wimQTKpApvj1n.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58c47916c3a36816700022c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Craig","original_name":"Scott Craig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c47c8292514163730025a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200644,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Esselman","original_name":"Mary Esselman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfae986d4c9700ec57f4f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1210822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y9DyfGEQSUxNFfsPxX0YdIF4xId.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
