Much as in similar found footage soliloquies by Péter Forgács, Jay Rosenblatt and Ken Jacobs, director Roger Deutsch wrings unexpected pathos from mundane traces of the past. Children mug for the camera with dances of the day, upright mothers march their strollers up the avenue, men smoke, the family gathers around the table to light the candles. The bare title cannot help but raise the specter of contemporaneous events in Europe, lending an extra degree of urgency to the film's meditation on disappearance. - Max Goldberg","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Otto Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jews","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Deutsch","original_name":"Roger Deutsch","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c79a129251417a23008c83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Deutsch","original_name":"Roger Deutsch","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c79a219251417a170090b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Deutsch","original_name":"Roger Deutsch","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c79a30c3a3683dd700847b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776263,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ludwig Schreiber","original_name":"Ludwig Schreiber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c79a5692514179f7008e0f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0359505","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
