A bar, a toilet, a wasteland, a garden, a trailer. The cruising body can't, unlike the flaneur, be alone. She won't leave the world outside of her. Several eyes follow her: the women holding the cameras, the director. The director is sending her a love letter. The director needs her cruising body. They are a part of each others fantasies and share a dream about a city's possibility of providing safe sexy spaces. They travel together to look for the rooms in between, to find rooms of their desires.","popularity":0.1162,"poster_path":"/uAQxBVetGRfPgleJVFfB7uEb419.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When We Are Together We Can Be Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Rosenfeld","original_name":"Liz Rosenfeld","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"602c2e988d22fc0042df3c87","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1117070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadie Lune","original_name":"Sadie Lune","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/mUQ1hah7dzNOYmSSOArpc131QBN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"602c2ea233ad8f003f8633d5","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1541107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulita Pappel","original_name":"Paulita Pappel","popularity":5.766,"profile_path":"/MRsZExZWiW5xjNiu65VWufnMr6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"602c2ea5df857c0040df1d25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703577,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Imogen Heath","original_name":"Imogen Heath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"602c2ead33ad8f003e862f8b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1179078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marit Östberg","original_name":"Marit Östberg","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/i0D7w0mNx6uGAgMA5h3unwdlXZe.jpg","credit_id":"58c6fd1992514179f70002c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":3,"id":583338,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karin Dreijer","original_name":"Karin Dreijer","popularity":3.992,"profile_path":"/v5G1aT9jKNmGxnmLQNczFDhOGoB.jpg","credit_id":"6669c3f5914b88907aea1d34","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Borusiade","original_name":"Borusiade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c2e8e33ad8f0040863e8f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1179078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marit Östberg","original_name":"Marit Östberg","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/i0D7w0mNx6uGAgMA5h3unwdlXZe.jpg","credit_id":"602c2e7afea0d70040312044","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5351800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uAQxBVetGRfPgleJVFfB7uEb419.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
