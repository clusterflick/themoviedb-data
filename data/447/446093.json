The film, which was never provided a soundtrack, was screened on several occasions with a soundtrack performed live consisting of a text for three voices and a number of musical pieces, among which were the “descent into hell” from the opera L’Orfeo by Monteverdi in the version by Edward H. Tarr, released in 1968 by Erato, “New York 1963 – America 1968” from Every One of Us by Eric Burdon and the Animals; and “The Return of the Son of the Monster Magnet” from Freak Out by [Frank Zappa and] The Mothers of Invention. After the “state of emergency” in January 1969, an epilogue was shot but it was never developed.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/uhB8ajABgYz2nDvIw4Anfn6zf2l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus Filmed on the Battlefield","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Maenza Blasco","original_name":"Antonio Maenza Blasco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c21508c3a36842d6002518","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0147126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQiWapvS56h4GbkAQzhv34Jl2eD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uhB8ajABgYz2nDvIw4Anfn6zf2l.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/shTZ8DbRLPPUmmu78wlP40PArCX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1056,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zZjRepnt17HoW8vHtcccWMBReCp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
