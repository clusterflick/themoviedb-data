She ran and walked through the grass, and didn't even notice how she ended up in a dense forest. She came across a hut in the forest in which there was no one. In the hut, as usual, there were three beds, three chairs and three bowls on the table. Varvara sat on all the chairs, tried all the bowls, jumped on all the beds, and fell asleep on the smallest one. Meanwhile, the owners of the hut - three bears - returned home.","popularity":0.0606,"poster_path":"/xK7BL9sIqAtNNSJ5nUO2u9Ix3MA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Bears","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Zyablikova","original_name":"Аида Зябликова","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/7Yg2bH7QrYYZqvmyrsHi1ZhP1gu.jpg","credit_id":"665a28a151a32dd27eeabb1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7021388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xK7BL9sIqAtNNSJ5nUO2u9Ix3MA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
