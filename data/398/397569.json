Though Cheng is an important transformational figure, his teachings have been overlooked. This documentary film tells the story of his remarkable life and features Tai Chi as a martial art and a spiritual practice. Over the past decade, we have shot approximately fifty hours of footage in New York, North Carolina, and California.","popularity":0.1069,"poster_path":"/lmlI3UPpGMBSnLakJVnEAqU7faX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Professor: Tai Chi's Journey West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3385405,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Pugh","original_name":"Elizabeth Pugh","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e45f6d7d2bc1009fcd5763","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joel Hirsch","original_name":"Joel Hirsch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e45f49f5c8240068ae77c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572234,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kenneth Van Sickle","original_name":"Kenneth Van Sickle","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e45f5a53466100193e7f74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Strugatz","original_name":"Barry Strugatz","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e45f62a410c80086bc7137","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572234,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kenneth Van Sickle","original_name":"Kenneth Van Sickle","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e45f541065d3009aa63bec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Strugatz","original_name":"Barry Strugatz","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57381ee2c3a368241e0003b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4273326","wikidata_id":"Q26833765","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lmlI3UPpGMBSnLakJVnEAqU7faX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
