Barren sands and endless gales proved too much for human settlement on this island off the coast of Nova Scotia. Only a small group of researchers and maintenance people occupy the island; horses run wild, seals and birds multiply profusely, and the Ipswich sparrow has found a fruitful breeding ground for itself. Sable Island provides a perfect opportunity to observe nature in an untouched, organic laboratory.","popularity":0.2648,"poster_path":"/dDEOfmGpNRUscEWUkI0J13dey6H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sable Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Davis","original_name":"Fred Davis","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5732de80c3a3686965001c2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Talbot","original_name":"Julien Talbot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5732debec3a36869530021e2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523693,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Keene","original_name":"Brian Keene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732de3ac3a3685fa2000dce","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143485,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julian Biggs","original_name":"Julian Biggs","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732dd13c3a368695e001e4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618225,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Nielson","original_name":"Erik Nielson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732dd73c3a3686965001c08","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Wargon","original_name":"Allan Wargon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732dcf19251413ff5000c10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598616,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dennis Sawyer","original_name":"Dennis Sawyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732de189251413ff5000c48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronald Weyman","original_name":"Ronald Weyman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef3926731644b00350fde5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618224,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Humble","original_name":"Robert Humble","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67981edda6e41283f12b5141","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0224043","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dDEOfmGpNRUscEWUkI0J13dey6H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5829,"name":"nova scotia, canada"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
