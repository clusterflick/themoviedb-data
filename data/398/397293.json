A secretive, nefarious agency seeks to control the culture. They do this by covertly staging reproductions of everyday events, and by so doing, undermining the moment’s originality and currency. Society is then left to puzzle over what might be real, and what is fake. The agency employs symbols—like the fascists, like imperial powers of the past—notably a red cone, to plant their flag upon the moment.  Two agents, Kathryn and Mason, exhausted by the toll each removal has taken from them, quietly, and then overtly, set out to undermine the agency.  Haunting, engaging, and with a ferocity of vision that calls to mind the cerebral thrillers of Shane Carruth, David Lynch, or Andrei Tarkovsky, Nicholas Rombes’s directorial debut is a spellbinding new work and apt analogy for the wormhole where modern social communication leads.","popularity":0.311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Two Dollar Radio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it still a revolution if no one notices?","title":"The Removals","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1339392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milly Sanders","original_name":"Milly Sanders","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/qAXxbmlX70usMgDlO94bdPoOWeE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kathryn","credit_id":"5734e7b2c3a36874e40005b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Wood","original_name":"Jeff Wood","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mason","credit_id":"5734e7dec3a36874ee00059a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Justus","original_name":"Joe Justus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bronson","credit_id":"5734e7ed9251417b420005ba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott McClanahan","original_name":"Scott McClanahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Accountant","credit_id":"5734e800c3a36874e90004bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Sensenig","original_name":"Andrew Sensenig","popularity":0.2248,"profile_path":"/wkzoOV3uW4iVeIGWUe2TIPO4DVk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Casey","credit_id":"5734e82192514104aa0004f2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619050,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mike Shiflet","original_name":"Mike Shiflet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5734e84bc3a36874d70005ea","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Rombes","original_name":"Nicholas Rombes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5734e77dc3a36874e90004a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4676528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
