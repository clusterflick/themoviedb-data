In November 2011, Rio de Janeiro’s largest slum ‘Rocinha’ is seized without a single shot fired. Shortly after the intervention, reports begin to emerge of rampant police abuse, which culminate in the disappearance of local bricklayer Amarildo de Souza. Amarildo was last seen being taken by the police for questioning, and his family believes that he has been tortured and murdered by the police. In the face of brutal oppression, together the residents start a protest movement that will shake the Brazilian establishment to the core.","popularity":0.1726,"poster_path":"/69zwAWLYKZtdUMIMhRZPwTX3oNZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of the Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Kiner","original_name":"Kevin Kiner","popularity":0.2761,"profile_path":"/FtGnTCUaMTNDESIuwhEmzCNIpp.jpg","credit_id":"651b3c0807216600c567c264","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2384647,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jared Forman","original_name":"Jared Forman","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651b3c1293bd690138feb837","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Jackson","original_name":"Dan Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5736c88cc3a36840ec000871","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5716566","wikidata_id":"Q26832648","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/69zwAWLYKZtdUMIMhRZPwTX3oNZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":677}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
