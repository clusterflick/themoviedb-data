Cesar Newashish, a 67-year-old Attikamek of the Manawan Reserve North of Montréal, uses only birchbark, cedar splints, spruce roots, and gum. With a sure hand he works methodically to fashion a craft unsurpassed in function or beauty of design. Building a canoe solely from the materials that the forest provides may become a lost art, even among the Native Peoples whose traditional craft it is. The film is free of spoken commentary but text appears on the screen in Cree, French, and English.\" - Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.2973,"poster_path":"/4smCKCE2kFSF6wIQLfm97avfHEW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cesar's Bark Canoe","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Newashish","original_name":"César Newashish","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d303b3a410c811f1931c35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732b40a925141657b0014a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d303bf66ae4d0084282756","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Larose","original_name":"Paul Larose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d303c8cb71b800a10d8a5a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serge Beauchemin","original_name":"Serge Beauchemin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d303cd5a07f5007b0b5ced","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monique Fortier","original_name":"Monique Fortier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d303d45a07f50082f3a980","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurice Blackburn","original_name":"Maurice Blackburn","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d303dc5a07f50082f3a984","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Lamoureux","original_name":"Roger Lamoureux","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d303e35a07f50086910068","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3565124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2211,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4smCKCE2kFSF6wIQLfm97avfHEW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1474},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JdxEG5Jk6KRuWbvYAG1NsJuU3r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":225532,"name":"quebec direct cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
