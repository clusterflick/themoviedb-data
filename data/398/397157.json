She has remained hugely influential ever since and this concert at Montreux in 2004 is a testament to her enduring popularity even 40 years after her death. Backed by a small jazz ensemble led by pianist Baptiste Trotignan, local stars Michael von der Heide, Régine and Catherine Ringer are joined by international artists Ute Lemper, Barbara Morrison and Angélique Kidjo to pay homage to \"The Little Sparrow\" as Piaf was affectionately known.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/tz3GmpmWCjSgqeaYHCoFKyMTTRJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tribute to Edith Piaf: Live at Montreux 2004","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tz3GmpmWCjSgqeaYHCoFKyMTTRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mOc79fWXNXoFXCRXhgnAR41iZBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
