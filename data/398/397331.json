My guess is that if one knows what he or she is looking at before seeing this little film, half of its excitement and a good deal of its meaning disappears. Seen in total innocence, though (and maybe I’m exaggerating the importance of this), SKY BLUE WATER is a wonder. With Gottheim’s Blues and Frampton’s Lemon (for Robert Hunt), it is one of the happiest, most uplifting short films I’ve ever seen.” – Scott MacDonald, Idiolects\" -- Scott MacDonald, Idiolects.
