He sits idly through lessons. Then, it's time for band, where he plays the piccolo. He daydreams through the Vienna waltz, imagining himself ice-skating, and sending the school bully into the cold water by cutting a circle through the ice around him. The band plays a second song, and Arnold imagines spring. The music ends, the room empties except for Arnold. The teacher says, \"Arnold, everybody's gone to recess.\"","popularity":0.1754,"poster_path":"/fUiFjdWzB7RIE25znVBC4bZfGSF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arnold Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Craig Bartlett","original_name":"Craig Bartlett","popularity":0.2283,"profile_path":"/druuzzORnUfQ5yrUCMtiTLetNls.jpg","credit_id":"57333e2bc3a36833f2000503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Craig Bartlett","original_name":"Craig Bartlett","popularity":0.2283,"profile_path":"/druuzzORnUfQ5yrUCMtiTLetNls.jpg","credit_id":"57333e36c3a36869610032d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0233238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f2DNKL5jZ9EgXyehSWgnFXl0zow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fUiFjdWzB7RIE25znVBC4bZfGSF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
