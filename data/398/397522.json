It infuriated me, because I had attempted to get away from his camera all my childhood. My father, filmmaker Joschy Scheidegger, documented our family obsessively. It was only when he died that I was impelled to take over not only his extensive film archive, but also his camera. «My Life as a Film» is a personal search for the surprising truths hidden behind my father’s pictures. A philosophical family story about filming and the attempt to capture life.","popularity":0.0979,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76813,"logo_path":null,"name":"SwissDok GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":75732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zürcher Hochschule der Künste","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How My Father Tried To Capture Happiness","title":"My Life as a Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eva Vitija","original_name":"Eva Vitija","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5737835dc3a3686f3b0006d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eva Vitija","original_name":"Eva Vitija","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5737836ec3a36840ec002cf4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619899,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stefan Dux","original_name":"Stefan Dux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573783869251417b3a003c0b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619900,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fabian Kaiser","original_name":"Fabian Kaiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5737839ac3a36840ec002d04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426561,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Natascha Cartolaro","original_name":"Natascha Cartolaro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573783a7c3a36840ec002d0a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619902,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernhard Köpke","original_name":"Bernhard Köpke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573783de925141125b0001c2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507445,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurizius Staerkle Drux","original_name":"Maurizius Staerkle Drux","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57378418c3a3687e1a004c85","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123119,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian García","original_name":"Christian García","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5737846b9251417dd8000488","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5800086","wikidata_id":"Q42414983","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"14/12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DAS LEBEN DREHEN - Trailer","key":"6HQDa_VKDN8","published_at":"2016-03-23T13:46:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5737858892514112d20001bc"}]}}}
