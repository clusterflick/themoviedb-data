Arcadio is the family patriarch, an authoritative and conservative man who rules over his family's destiny as he does over the chickens on his farm. Teresa, his eldest, left home during her college years to become an astrophysicist against her father's wishes. Now, after a 7-year absence, she returns home for a few weeks in order to reveal a secret long kept from her family and to invite them to her wedding with Daniela. But, once back, her intentions turn to dust when she finds herself trapped in the family's old habit of lying. No one in the family is as they seem, nor are they willing to unveil their true selves. Within this world of half-truths, Teresa encounters Andrés, her nephew, a boy with Asperger's Syndrome who shares her passion for the stars.","popularity":0.3925,"poster_path":"/78PGh0nZZLaTJRUbt8ZWRAKER7u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77040,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Taller Cinemático","origin_country":""},{"id":76692,"logo_path":null,"name":"C&E Producciones","origin_country":"VE"},{"id":76693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pulsar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2017-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about love, survival, and stars","title":"Extra Terrestres","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","title":"EXTRAterrestres","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisé Álvarez","original_name":"Marisé Álvarez","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/gbxqOVq81DVyZRLtkQ98XbWDE7a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"57340182925141393b0011f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunshine Logroño","original_name":"Sunshine Logroño","popularity":0.2209,"profile_path":"/4U8Z14ilXJJ4EYblBmv9sfFyY00.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Arcadio Diaz","credit_id":"5734018ec3a36850f10010e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Aleman","original_name":"Laura Aleman","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/jHjuSQhM9sV2U8RWgmrVtnEcfcU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Andrea","credit_id":"573402909251417515000363","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yamil Collazo","original_name":"Yamil Collazo","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/bBhXdd3eT9Hib4lXqbhAYhgfFXH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Junior Diaz","credit_id":"5734029b9251413c36001197","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":985144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elba Escobar","original_name":"Elba Escobar","popularity":0.1774,"profile_path":"/vaxIqobzvzaqxKPrh7Nq6KqxUYu.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Genoveva Sotomayor","credit_id":"578d1176c3a3686efa002691","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1652853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauricio Alemañy","original_name":"Mauricio Alemañy","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":"/jRjBgafBlfOaoVSYc6AuoKL4YVO.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Andrés","credit_id":"578d118d9251417aca011c44","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1022409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prakriti Maduro","original_name":"Prakriti Maduro","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/qYUREfR2MOO0pNKUAE6cbBOqXjY.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Daniela Soderberg","credit_id":"578d11a0c3a3686f0a001fb5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eyra Agüero Joubert","original_name":"Eyra Agüero Joubert","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Amarilis","credit_id":"57fb366cc3a3683ac60057eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Álvarez","original_name":"Ricardo Álvarez","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Lic.
