This remarkable ability causes her much suffering, for upon reaching adolescence, she is diagnosed as mad on account of seeing people who are not there. Only later does she find a way to cultivate her gifts within the spiritualist movement.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadowland or Light from the Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Beloff","original_name":"Zoe Beloff","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/w278aEfkKp3vPYvHDZRnPqBphhl.jpg","credit_id":"573910109251414b03000860","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
