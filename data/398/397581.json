During the 1950s and 60s, Britain consumed 430,000 tons of cod each year, but as the stocks started to diminish the livelihoods of fishing communities in both countries were at stake. Iceland took steps to protect their fishing industry - the mainstay of their economy - resulting in the three so-called Cod Wars. This was a David and Goliath struggle, where the small fleet of Icelandic gunboats were pitted against the British trawlers and the Royal Navy in the North Atlantic.  This Icelandic film, made in 2001, tells the story from both sides and reflects on the impact of the Cod Wars in Grimsby and Hull.","popularity":0.1962,"poster_path":"/8qOSd43rTHsrPELzJ3tVTET0SM6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cod Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056195,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Magnús Viðar Sigurðsson","original_name":"Magnús Viðar Sigurðsson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/pZ7YDjb5OZPls7oZyWG5LknHCqU.jpg","credit_id":"5738368ac3a3680832000a87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8qOSd43rTHsrPELzJ3tVTET0SM6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":658,"name":"sea"},{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
