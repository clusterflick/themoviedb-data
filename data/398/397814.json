Every song was directed by a different director and includes 2 bonus videos of unreleased songs. The unprecedented collection came about as the brainchild of otaku-house, the production company owned and run by childhood friends Nick Harmer, bassist for Death Cab for Cutie, and video director Aaron Stewart-Ahn. They saw the opportunity to enlist a variety of talented young artists to each make a short film set to a Death Cab song, without the constraints of the traditional music video- no arbitrary performance footage, the band themselves would not appear in the films. The ultimate goal was to create a series of small films that worked together as both individual pieces of art and as a unified whole.","popularity":0.117,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Cab for Cutie: Directions","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Ryang","original_name":"Robert Ryang","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd8fe610e0a26507d0034dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1844585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Stewart-Ahn","original_name":"Aaron Stewart-Ahn","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd8fb819251411569002f77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162654,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tarin Anderson","original_name":"Tarin Anderson","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fed13c9c2ff3d003cd5a998","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
