The kids are traveling to the countryside together. They get to two of Aneta's grandparents - one of her grandmothers was married three times. Aneta's favorite grandfather is her grandmother's third husband. He is not her real grandfather, but she loves him because he likes to fantasize. He taught Aneta a magic game - to light a match and imagine anything in flame. Her favorite grandfather dies. Aneta mourns him for a long time, lights matches but no use.","popularity":0.2193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1979-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moments in a Matchbox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Migove v kibritena kutiyka","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1618474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violeta Doneva","original_name":"Violeta Doneva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/48k2AzXJ42QYHTCZI2l0z1KAwEq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maykata na Aneta","credit_id":"57335ed592514152c6000d63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dossio Dossev","original_name":"Dossio Dossev","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/hOQIWfhI2UFycBup5froRtAhNbC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lyubimiyat dyado","credit_id":"57335ee39251413ff50024cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1199876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leda Taseva","original_name":"Leda Taseva","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/n9Y437yqhH9fCPMXcMVfm5UupFr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Babata","credit_id":"57335ef0c3a3683457000bb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Danailov","original_name":"Stefan Danailov","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/rmT6zY7qVZnYtySjQ0DNX5UoRnM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kvartirantat","credit_id":"57335eff92514152c6000d6b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1558174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Evstatieva-Biolcheva","original_name":"Mariana Evstatieva-Biolcheva","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/dpCqDQ2QfVBmBwDbIgaz1WTNgY2.jpg","credit_id":"57335eb5925141656b00390d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olga Krasteva","original_name":"Olga Krasteva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57335ec092514152c6000d59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olga Krasteva","original_name":"Olga Krasteva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57335f2b9251413ff50024e5","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0339389","wikidata_id":"Q12286634","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238349,"name":"matchbox"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
