Tony McAleer is a former Skinhead and Holocaust denier who went on to become a founding member of the anti-hate activist group Life After Hate. Profoundly aware and deeply ashamed of the lineage of hate he'd once promoted, Tony had long-contemplated traveling to Auschwitz in the spirit of tshuvah - to bear witness to the inconceivable ravages of the Holocaust, and deepen his personal work against the rise of extremist politics. This project documents his profoundly personal journey of atonement to Auschwitz/Birkenau - exploring the conditions that allowed for the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe; shedding a unique light upon how men get into, and out of, violent extremist groups; and serving as a cautionary tale for our time that underscores the dangers in allowing hate to be left unchecked.","popularity":0.0735,"poster_path":"/6aY94Ofa9JPgoZi4fIWoQgwgsfp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the roots of hatred, the seeds of change","title":"The Cure for Hate: Bearing Witness to Auschwitz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4025425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony McAleer","original_name":"Tony McAleer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6445affab3f6f5049c9f1c11","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310644,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter D.
