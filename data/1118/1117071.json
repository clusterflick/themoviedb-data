They slept most of the time during the day to avoid the heat. But now their time has come. They are equipped with “super senses” that enable them to find their prey in complete darkness while staying invisible themselves.  Lions, leopards and hyenas are the ultimate rulers of the night, but they all have different hunting strategies. Leopards sneak up to their prey like phantoms and attack in the last moment, while lions try to ambush their next meal and take it down as a team. Hyenas are long distance athletes and hunt their victims to exhaustion.  All of this would be left in the dark, if not for extremely light sensitive lenses and thermal cameras. Thanks to this modern technique, we are able to get a unique view into the secret world of Africa’s hunters of the night.","popularity":1.8543,"poster_path":"/9UHxt2q0RSXhIGKE7OFaQ2FWA2T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84339,"logo_path":"/xHTkcQihsN49kgVZNWEHT4omGym.png","name":"ZDF Enterprises","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR Naturfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":86718,"logo_path":"/tw1SVioAxByZQqUlZLEoE6ofoiO.png","name":"Doclights","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa's Hunters of the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Solman","original_name":"Colin Solman","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/1QGzpM9cwaySHXGPYrgGd9d3UEr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65deb3f4d5dbc2016357717e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reinhard Radke","original_name":"Reinhard Radke","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/VihfVwvm7SyWT61tEnYn8MEGjb.jpg","credit_id":"65deb4fe7614210162d4c067","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reinhard Radke","original_name":"Reinhard Radke","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/VihfVwvm7SyWT61tEnYn8MEGjb.jpg","credit_id":"65deb518b76cbb017dd823b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1816053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Lingnau","original_name":"Martin Lingnau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mD5WCrz4mq2R6A0xJayAFnXOMau.jpg","credit_id":"65deb5349638640162d76714","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zfMQTgSnyrG4hBEri8akCohB7a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yvK9Z8qD2WJVlDTedCn8XL3oaMa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1806},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1344,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rXBVrrjBrG93DmNK1NjlDI6cARu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2390}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLRNurvWZsPQnC163u2qihj8TUU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":925,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9UHxt2q0RSXhIGKE7OFaQ2FWA2T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":617}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":251493,"name":"big cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Africa's Hunters of the Night | Wildlife Documentary","key":"cO6Zti_t8r0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-25T16:00:30.000Z","id":"65deb12fd5dbc20163576f4c"}]}}}
