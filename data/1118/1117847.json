The stadiumâ€™s general manager, J.J. van den Berg, is in the audience.  The national anthems are played, and the players of Denmark and the Netherlands introduce themselves. The field is surrounded by four very crowded stands, and each corner has a monumental tower. Seated on the covered grandstand are well-known figures, including Princess De Ligne, J.P. Kan, and C. Feith. The Netherlands takes an early lead in the match, which the 30,000-plus spectators deliriously applaud. When the Netherlands brings the score to 2-0 in the second half, the mood becomes even more exuberant. For the first time in football history, the Netherlands beats Denmark.","popularity":0.0716,"poster_path":"/mYgHAyMw0CytUyLfJxzoQyeAWdL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95553,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haghe Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1920-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Holland-Denmark Football Match","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Mullens","original_name":"Willy Mullens","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/edeBhe7S05zOvNSwbGu3rJroEb6.jpg","credit_id":"6447d48fe18b9705065b2268","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Mullens","original_name":"Willy Mullens","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/edeBhe7S05zOvNSwbGu3rJroEb6.jpg","credit_id":"6447d49935818f0572f9233b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mYgHAyMw0CytUyLfJxzoQyeAWdL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
