From his base in London, he travelled the world, rubbing shoulders with the political elite such as Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro and the Queen of England. He tirelessly worked for “his people” and the good causes he has established.  In 2003, King Constantine finally returned to his country - a timely homecoming for a man who won a gold medal at the Rome Olympics - and was instrumental in winning the 2004 Olympic Games for Athens. This intimate and personal film is based on unprecedented access to the King and his family.  King Constantine talks as never before about the events that led to his exile and his fight for justice and recognition. It includes exclusive footage inside the family home in Hampstead, behind the scenes at the Royal events and “off-duty” moments. This is the King’s story. The story of a man who lost his crown but refused to give up","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/uiAp1LTUsNjJwRYH6DA3uiMCXNz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Constantine: A King's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Constantine II","original_name":"King Constantine II","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8Dn4Do1uh7L8cAWM1UCQlZc61rV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6445e3de1941860555eba023","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Castle","original_name":"James Castle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6445e3c5b54002050c26b917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12053666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s7zGjkpZ6CDzE9hRpWGRH43mQxs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uiAp1LTUsNjJwRYH6DA3uiMCXNz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
