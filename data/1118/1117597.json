The story unfolds with the narration of veteran Hollywood stunt coordinator Gary Zeller (DAWN OF THE DEAD, RAGTIME, SCANNERS), who \"put his reputation on the line\" to collaborate with the Impact Addict. Filmmaker Larry Fessenden brings to this stunning documentary all the passion and drama of that spectacular night: As James Brown look-alike Jack Dingas pumps the crowd with an American anthem, our Rocket Man climbs aboard his bastard craft and bids farewell to the woman he lovesâ€”only to end that night in a near fatal fiery crash.","popularity":0.2898,"poster_path":"/j2PCcQFvOfP4z2gEgrwurLbw3Fy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rocket Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Leslie","original_name":"David Leslie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64470eaaef9d7204a3a6392a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15067,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gary Zeller","original_name":"Gary Zeller","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64470eb4ef9d7204cfa6397e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fessenden","original_name":"Larry Fessenden","popularity":0.7112,"profile_path":"/qxccgH2oyAZnmz3ZxlpCPuhhvVi.jpg","credit_id":"64470e9c21118f02fcf2e719","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Leslie","original_name":"David Leslie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64470f0f21118f04e3f2e733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2PCcQFvOfP4z2gEgrwurLbw3Fy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
