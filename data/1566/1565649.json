Her body and her being carry traces of something foreign, something she cannot understand. To escape this strangeness, she develops a fascination with watching — always the observer, never the participant. But when she encounters a man, her fear of closeness begins to give way, turning into obsession. Gradually, her watching crosses boundaries: from distance to intimacy, from desire to intrusion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A woman on the edge of punishment and redemption","title":"A Voyeurs Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
