Do our contemporaries have a sensitivity to his words, images and ideas, or do they perceive them as part of an irretrievably gone past? Does his bright and tragic personality provoke the imagination, or does his name only activate the hollow admiration learned at school for the \"genius of Bulgarian poetry\"? The film goes through the personal history of the poet to try to understand the fiery extremity of his love, his pathos as a revolutionary and patriot, the psychological depth and existential problematic of his poetic texts.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is Yavorov mythologized?","title":"Following the Shadows of the Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
