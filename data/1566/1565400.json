What begins as a simple act of unity soon grows into something larger—a search for purpose, identity, and truth in a place that has long chosen silence. There is Gabbi, a sharp-tongued, brooding painter whose dark outlook often masks a restless idealism; Jay, a public attorney caught between duty and conviction; Marco, a weary engineer in a corrupt firm struggling to keep his integrity; and withdrawn, brilliant Anna, who quietly anchors them all. As their world begins to shift, they come to realize that activism is not only about standing up—it’s about the quiet endurance that follows, the kind that tests one’s faith in others and in oneself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some will leave, some will let go, yet the cry will go on.","title":"Sigaw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jimwell Cruz","original_name":"Jimwell Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f55df77b30bb60d3cd0b8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
