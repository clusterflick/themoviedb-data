Stefan has been a film photographer for over a decade and often shoots with large format cameras. In this Super 8 film, I followed him during an afternoon-evening around Victoria, starting off with shooting a portrait of Anthony, the owner of Camera Traders. Later on we drove elsewhere around downtown as he found interesting people and subjects to photograph on Polaroid type film.  Although his passion is photography, Stefanâ€™s day job is with the Canadian Air Force. Since shooting this project with him, he has moved away to Saskatchewan to train as a Snowbirds pilot.  Stefan-Works is my 4rd year submitting for the Cinevic One Take Super 8. I previously submitted films in 2019, 2021 and 2024.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stefan-Works","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyson Laidler","original_name":"Tyson Laidler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f52df79daba0f0d72d6745","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
