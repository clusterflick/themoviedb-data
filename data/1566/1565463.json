Several scenes that were supposed to be inserted into the section where the white leader appears were omitted (they were never filmed), which resulted in an abrupt and nonsensical progression afterwards. Since this work was not originally intended to be shown to others, I suppose it's fine as it is... It's too late to do anything about it now. The film originally had a recording of a certain famous piece of classical music, but the YouTube version was re-edited with different music and sound effects as a copyright measure.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8fuxTwVORME4uVPqHh7DwTQKgx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TOKYO PANORAMA HUNTING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3220493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","original_name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68f590e3f3982c8fde3a3351","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3220493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","original_name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f590f93d92b804fe97f710","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3220493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","original_name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f5910c5c6fbb49402d680a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3220493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","original_name":"Nobuyuki Yamagishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f5911c29a0b2ad3f3a32ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1867637","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8fuxTwVORME4uVPqHh7DwTQKgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1985-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
