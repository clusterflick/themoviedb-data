Schouten is taking a different approach to her show. She's not just hiding behind a costume; no, you see more of Tineke herself, the things that keep her busy. She's been through some turbulent times; the world has been turned upside down. How do you hang up the banners then? And does Tineke really have a fetish for shoes, phones, or computers? Maybe she should give her unvarnished opinion or have a deeper conversation! Of course, Tineke will join the audience in putting things into perspective and laughing at our own shortcomings, interspersed with songs, accompanied by top-notch musicians.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tineke Schouten: De Schouten Schoenen Aan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
