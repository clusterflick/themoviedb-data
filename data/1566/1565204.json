With no words for numbers, no fixed past or future tense, and a structure that defies conventional grammar, their language is as enigmatic as their way of life. For centuries, they have resisted outside influence, preserving a culture built on the present moment and oral tradition. Linguists and anthropologists alike are fascinated by this unique form of communication, which challenges fundamental ideas about human cognition and language itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Pirahã World: Deciphering the Amazon’s Most Enigmatic Language","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
