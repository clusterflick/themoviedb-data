This Super 8 project is my first experience as a camera operator. While the outcome was not what I first imagined-the story I planned didnâ€™t fully develop, and my inexperience with the camera showed-it became an invaluable part of my creative journey. Through the process, I discovered how much there is to learn in both technical skill and storytelling, and I am excited to continue exploring film as a way to grow and share my voice.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still The One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Crocker","original_name":"Jules Crocker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f52ac125cfc5e4692d66dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
