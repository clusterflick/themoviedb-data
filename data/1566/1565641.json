Here, a few farmers, for different reasons, have chosen to keep on working with cart-horses of the Belgian ‘Underbred’-race. These huge and heavy horses, with their calm and friendly character were traditionally used in this region because of the heavy clay. Nowadays, all farmers, except for a small group of stubborn horse-lovers, switched to the tractor. The film interweaves the story of the farmers with the life cycle of the horses. As the story develops, the specific interest of each separate farmer: breeding, horse-show or workpride, becomes clear. Their relationship of silent comra-deship with the horses, the rhythm of their days, and their involvement in the well being of the horses sound through every scene. Above all, it’s a film told with a sense of down to earth humour, about love, life and death and of people that hold on to what is dear to them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":277802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stichting Job","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1998-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Van Mannen en Merries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Of Men and Mares","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5114332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Metje Postma","original_name":"Metje Postma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f627196cb60db8ed691643","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5760809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lisa Hammel","original_name":"Lisa Hammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f628b617f18e569fcd0e19","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5760810,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Warner van Es","original_name":"Warner van Es","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f628cd3ce2f863f0101e3e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1998-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
