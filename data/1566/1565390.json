Directed by Andrés Valenzuela and produced by Cinéculo, the film embodies the metaphor of dilation as the protagonist unveils what pleasure means to him: breaking away from a restrictive and guilt-ridden society, and experiencing absolute freedom by letting go and allowing himself to explore.\r From his childhood-adolescence in Melipilla to the reality of entering the erotic industry, the documentary shows how the body, pleasure, and social media coexist to generate tangible economic support.
