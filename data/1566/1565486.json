He fell in love with the peaceful life of soaking in forest hot springs, while his grandchild, Gogou, quickly developed a taste for delicious Taiwanese food. Taiwan is one of the world’s best destinations for hot springs, and Grandpa Capybara has journeyed from the south to the north of the island, experiencing all kinds of springs—hot, cold, and even mineral-rich turbid ones. As they explore, Gogou is often bumped by falling fruits from trees planted long ago by those who came before them. But as they soak and travel, they begin to notice something troubling: the forests are shrinking, and their beloved new home is in danger...  This short animated film is part of Liang-Yu Chen's ecological art series, echoing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/etyBXDPs6QiNZ7eF3qYyacjZfNc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2025-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A global citizen must see.
