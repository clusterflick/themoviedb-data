Their new flat feels cold and lifeless - a stark contrast to the vibrant world they left behind.  On her first day at a new school, Gemma feels isolated and overwhelmed. But a rainy walk home leads her to a mural of starlings and the words: “Sometimes we need fantasy to survive the reality.”  Later, drawn by birdsong and light, she discovers a derelict studio. As starlings circle above, the space transforms into a vivid dreamscape of colour and imagination.  Eager to share it, she brings Albie. In this fleeting moment, surrounded by wonder, they reconnect.  Starlings is a poetic meditation on mental health, family, and the quiet resilience of imagination.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/pnigs7ov4ANJhXqXxOhURBgpPx0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes we need fantasy to survive the reality","title":"The Starlings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gemma","credit_id":"68f659d4171fc6b1c88f8abe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5761356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayden Lepine-Williams","original_name":"Hayden Lepine-Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Albie","credit_id":"68f65a0425cfc5e4692d6af8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","credit_id":"68f65a301a8e98866632159f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","credit_id":"68f66202b346be18b88f8b22","department":"Art","job":"Prop Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","credit_id":"68f66229c8258835ec3214d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","credit_id":"68f6629d2298274e7b2d6b79","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","credit_id":"68f662fbe43f59f52df5c364","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5761396,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f66324ccf09be683101f67","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4016431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Caruana","original_name":"Florence Caruana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAOoTI6Gs9ieNHB1c7lTxaM79I.jpg","credit_id":"68f6642b2298274e7b2d6b7c","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2183,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pnigs7ov4ANJhXqXxOhURBgpPx0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1543},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2147,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/muEGaiMRZovlk2EJcTAcaew5wfw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1431}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2487,"name":"naivety"},{"id":704,"name":"adolescence"},{"id":1533,"name":"isolation"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":14549,"name":"loss of job"},{"id":14633,"name":"moving out"},{"id":157955,"name":"childhood"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":170351,"name":"reality vs fantasy"},{"id":193521,"name":"part animation"},{"id":222029,"name":"loss of innocence"},{"id":229785,"name":"dreamscape"},{"id":237651,"name":"dreamland"},{"id":240422,"name":"wonder"},{"id":245026,"name":"moving"},{"id":278275,"name":"multimedia"},{"id":281585,"name":"inspirational"},{"id":284103,"name":"theatre"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":288815,"name":"creative storytelling"},{"id":314893,"name":"magical"},{"id":316421,"name":"drama"},{"id":325764,"name":"ambivalent"},{"id":325840,"name":"optimistic"},{"id":330923,"name":"wonderland"},{"id":351091,"name":"emotional"},{"id":352279,"name":"shadow puppetry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
