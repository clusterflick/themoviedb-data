When a talent scout discovers him at a bus stop, Jae’s life explodes overnight—from classrooms and basketball courts to brutal dance studios and blinding stage lights under millions of fans. But under relentless perfectionism, Jae slowly loses the joy that first inspired him. His smile becomes performance; his identity, a product. Alongside Shin, an older trainee hardened by years of waiting and poverty, Jae confronts the price of success: the isolation, exhaustion, and loss of self. When the group debuts, Shin finally earns the spotlight Jae no longer recognizes. Through a reflective college interview, Jae realizing that the bravest act may be stepping away from the stage. \"Just Jae\" is a story about authenticity and explores the courage it takes to walk away when ambition threatens humanity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4I09PQTSwKxucS0aM2jvmTqYFpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Jae","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"저스트 재","type":"Korean"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5759002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Choi","original_name":"Lucas Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jae / Scout / Han","credit_id":"68f4ff9ae62489df9d9a5ec3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Choi","original_name":"Rachel Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mom / Interviewer","credit_id":"68f4ffa80d3dea465e4e72a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Karlsson","original_name":"Philip Karlsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"68f4ffb083c0a4d32af99e30","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Chang","original_name":"Timothy Chang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shin","credit_id":"68f4ffb99d5cd385e77e3140","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koomin Chung","original_name":"Koomin Chung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"68f4ffbe8adf64960a8e7520","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Choi","original_name":"Lucas Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f4ffcb21eeb7d7db9a5f5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3749148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherice Griffiths","original_name":"Sherice Griffiths","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/yegsZGwCJeJaKnTy2L2aVpGsVyd.jpg","credit_id":"68f4ffda1cd190455a8d062a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5759002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Choi","original_name":"Lucas Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f4ffe455b94fbad68e7198","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5759009,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucas Choi","original_name":"Lucas Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f4ffeb051dc0c0c59a5ec4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4I09PQTSwKxucS0aM2jvmTqYFpp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h0rx0bvaXuDkfDR6Cs488OBM3mQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1d1KpieV6MfjhnfsMCJXgrBRzKc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3394,"name":"identity crisis"},{"id":6562,"name":"celebrity"},{"id":225273,"name":"k-pop"},{"id":290327,"name":"seoul, south korea"},{"id":318386,"name":"kdrama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
