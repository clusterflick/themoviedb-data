A tracking camera reveals a sleeping man. In a period-piece dream (of his own childhood?) we see a young woman with a baby carriage and an older, heavy-set man with a cigar. When the carriage rolls down a staircase toward the man, his bulk fortunately stops it and saves the baby. Later, they meet again at a pizza parlor, where hot cheese from the slice he orders inadvertently slides in slow motion onto the baby. The dreamer awakens with a start revealing a face marred by burn scars.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":277738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bellone
