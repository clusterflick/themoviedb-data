Through macro and close-up shots, the film captures the subtle transmission of life and energy between plants, water, and light during springtime in northeastern America. Through digital post-production, the film weaves together the ethereal qualities of nature with intimate body performance. The film perforations become miniature frames, creating tiny windows that house paintings and micro-videos. Within these windows, each subtle movement of the body performer, like spring breeze caressing, engages in a silent dialogue with the surrounding plants. The experimental approach extends to the margins of the filmâ€”where key codes beyond the perforations, typically used for frame-by-frame specific identification, transform into concrete poetry. The verses appear as casual murmuring across the film, carrying a sense of introspection and reflection.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xhljyCjjDAymIgSodHFX3C285uT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell It to Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juyi Mao","original_name":"Juyi Mao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f4bd71dfc63f757900da93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xhljyCjjDAymIgSodHFX3C285uT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"27th FCDEP (Collectif Jeune Cinema) - Competition","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
