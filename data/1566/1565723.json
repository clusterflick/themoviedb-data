Born into a Catholic family and struggling to put his homosexuality into words, the director finds in pornography a space for self-exploration and acceptance. The film dives into the nuances of alternative pornography, challenging stigmas and revealing how desire, identity, and the politics of the body intertwine both on screen and in life. A work that pulses between the personal and the universal, Vibrations challenges perceptions and invites a rediscovery of pleasure and freedom through the image.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wnfCD0qkmEiVHeIuDdl8Mtuevz3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274374,"logo_path":null,"name":"École Agnès Varda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2025-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vibrations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5761096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Do Canto Soll","original_name":"Miguel Do Canto Soll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f64631c8258835ec32143f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1754,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wnfCD0qkmEiVHeIuDdl8Mtuevz3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1241}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Brussels Porn Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
