The anatomist has discovered a unique and very powerful psychoactive substance derived from a rare toad and a specific dung beetle fungus. Jessup returns to campus and replicates the substance, which he names Obliterene. He summons his tight-knit group of academics, all of whom studied together at Bard, to attend a mysterious, Obliterene-fueled experience, that he believes will happen during a total solar eclipse on the winter solstice. The five uber-academics revel in one-upping one another about their accomplishments, and lament the loss of the sixth member of their group.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Purkinje Effect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
