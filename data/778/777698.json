Met through a newspaper personal ad in 1995, the two dads, one from Taiwan and the other one from suburban Chicago, formed a life partnership and had a baby through surrogacy with the help from a sister in 2003. The child, now a teenager, considers themselves pansexual. The film is a collection of different perspectives from all parties involved. It is a heart-warming and brave story inspirational for all families.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qUp9c7Y4OzCZxesEbQ1rnhS4gLU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Dads and One Queer Teen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2507800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Tung","original_name":"Larry Tung","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7f6716c0b36004159cfcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qUp9c7Y4OzCZxesEbQ1rnhS4gLU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
