But Volume 7 is also jam packed with newly unearthed treasures, featuring singing rabbis, petulant news anchors, coughing snake handlers, bodybuilding clowns, and two body parts never before seen in the festival! It's a celebration of a decade of Found. Record over and you'll die! Taped live at The Grey Eagle in Asheville, North Carolina.","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":"/oNYUFTeGj9rKzkoxapTivrkXmv3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Found Footage Festival #7: Asheville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pickett","original_name":"Joe Pickett","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/qaVGmThDf5aa6TluTj5YQN25Cfu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fdba773d46537004049dc0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Prueher","original_name":"Nick Prueher","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/iAOVgXkfJxJBkcvnM9QJQpGSPVW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fdba77ecf48a10041477629","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":87288,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonny Gillette","original_name":"Jonny Gillette","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdba799109dec0042f2eb37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10815466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oNYUFTeGj9rKzkoxapTivrkXmv3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
