Original intertitles precede each change of scene, but the locations provided are incorrect for three of the five views. The state of the ruins and camp suggest a date in late April, 1906. The absence of streetcar tracks in the \"Grand Avenue\" panorama dates that segment to before May 1, 1906.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/m4NTLCgdpbk49KXlFMmM45kRSGe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1906-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Francisco After the Earthquake and Fire of 1906","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m4NTLCgdpbk49KXlFMmM45kRSGe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
