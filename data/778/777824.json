At 93, the Queen of England still defies time and carries with her the memory of our modern world. Her reign is officially the longest of British monarchy, but her life has never been a long calm river.  Between the Brexit earthquake, the hospitalization of Prince Philip, Harry and Meghan renouncing the crown, and the sexual accusations against her favorite son, Andrew, she has recently faced many painful challenges. But the iconic queen remains steadfast. And she is ready for the next round: to manage the successful passing of the Crown.  Thanks to archive footage and a few dramatized scenes, together with interviews of those who know the Royal Family best, this history documentary takes a look back at the key milestones of the Queen over the recent years.","popularity":0.2262,"poster_path":"/zBPvpOi3FkCWuSOEz89PGfKDNYM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elephant Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":153036,"logo_path":"/zG95eMpnyQhi24e3FUBrhLZZJGK.png","name":"Chrysalide Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen Elizabeth's Last Battles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Elizabeth II: God Save the Queen!","type":"Pre-production title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1755529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hurel","original_name":"Pierre Hurel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/4PmlGeRugitL42f3VUpUxTqvuel.jpg","credit_id":"5fde8f943c887d0042abce04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLQDXr1H31abFB8oIKnDs6q46zG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ngho6fD7zEp6YAYzOTN6XXY0g6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/urCiTNMbeuoGQtHWhexJhfoXgNQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/zBPvpOi3FkCWuSOEz89PGfKDNYM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/6G4z32FlOo3Omekm2iWwyqE62bU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"APTA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Movistar #0","release_date":"2020-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
