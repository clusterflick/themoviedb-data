Blending footage shot over the past year in two separate colonial archive buildings - one in Lagos, Nigeria, and the other in Bristol, United Kingdom - this double portrait considers the 'sonic shadows' that colonial images continue to generate, despite the disintegration of the memory and their materials. It mixes the genres of the radio play, the corporate video tour and detective noir, with a haunting and critical approach to the horror of discovery.","popularity":0.2513,"poster_path":"/eONqaN6587Zo59KcFHSLpZdHfFO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145852,"logo_path":null,"name":"KW Institute of Contemporary Art","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A So-Called Archive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Roxburgh","original_name":"Elizabeth Roxburgh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Additional Voiceover","credit_id":"5fddfb3ab0ba7e003e9f113f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900092,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Segun Adekoya","original_name":"Segun Adekoya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fddf9be97fdec003eb91962","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Reba Martin","original_name":"Reba Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fddfa880e4419003fe7d0f5","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900090,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Omowunmi Ogundipe","original_name":"Omowunmi Ogundipe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fddf996fd4a96003f2dcd6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900091,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Morgan K.
