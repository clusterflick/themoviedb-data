No human words are spoken here. Rather, the sights and sounds of Christmas are presented in a visual feast of whimsical, happy scenes accompanied by seasonal music. From sledding and snowmen to glowing candles and shimmering ornaments, dozens of animated and live-action settings communicate the beauty and wonder of the holiday season. Penguin puppets unwrap presents, ring bells, and toss tinsel. Santa's sleigh in a gentle snowfall segues smoothly into a playful group of Christmas-clad youngsters dancing to Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker.\"","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/iEf8DCvCdxFJtw1yysTttco43Kt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72308,"logo_path":"/uWSAY8ShgVsIdKtWUyav8QfI2nG.png","name":"The Baby Einstein Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Einstein: Baby Santa's Music Box","video":true,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Baby Einstein: Baby Santa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Baby Einstein: Baby Santa's Music Box","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0488490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/hOpkeMN8IZ3CEZIzpf0JkLlmLWK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.986,"height":491,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/uHRfv2hHZS0uR74qY8KCdvS8suw.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":484}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iEf8DCvCdxFJtw1yysTttco43Kt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":2143,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/dQ3RUNfvX4sfBwHb7BmrFI3Gesc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1991,"name":"santa claus"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
