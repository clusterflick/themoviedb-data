It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of urban spaces in major cities and the type that inhabits them, and a fluid discussion with renowned designers about their work, the creative process, and the choices and aesthetics behind their use of type.","popularity":0.7309,"poster_path":"/s47TOnvnwfSnAflQvsBxJbOLnmP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Swiss
