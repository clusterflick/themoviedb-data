It takes them from Brazil to Berlin, a city of perpetual movement, where the old constantly has to give space to the new. The couple finds a home and transforms it into the center of their own universe. As time passes and seasons change, life and cinema become interchangeable and their apartment evolves into an ever-changing stage, where friends are invited to play their own roles and reality and fiction merge. Until one day a cosmic portal appears in their home, opening connections between the past, the present and the future.","popularity":0.5753,"poster_path":"/gcbl7E2PqSCUCLoX43M6G60zouW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Distruktur","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muito Romântico","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1586970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Dullius","original_name":"Melissa Dullius","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/sBLi8ctHD387EIDIDecH4vv46qD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56db80edc3a368689d00031a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Jahn","original_name":"Gustavo Jahn","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/8qzzuO2jBhKevH1mdCcHdsZMuqA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56db80f7925141169a00032d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gustavo Beck","original_name":"Gustavo Beck","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/lkNN3nFNZIw85VEK2bWwNSWvHbc.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"581b870b92514115ce001cc5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kana Chiaki","original_name":"Kana Chiaki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"581b870fc3a368695e001844","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aqico Coco","original_name":"Aqico Coco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"581b8714c3a3686964001eda","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1160223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friederike Frerichs","original_name":"Friederike Frerichs","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/g4l2QjIkQyWOmcKVVeJbEsATME1.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"","credit_id":"581b871ac3a3686964001ee2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Haegert","original_name":"Erik Haegert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"","credit_id":"581b8720c3a368695e00185a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703577,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Imogen Heath","original_name":"Imogen Heath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"","credit_id":"581b872492514115ca001b63","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1703578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilja Löffler","original_name":"Lilja Löffler","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"","credit_id":"581b873092514115ce001cea","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Nietz","original_name":"Steve Nietz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"","credit_id":"581b8740c3a3686952001de9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuki Mori","original_name":"Yuki Mori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"","credit_id":"581b877492514115ce001d3a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah S.
