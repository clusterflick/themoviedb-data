The next view shows the Emperor Charlemagne crowning his son Lewis. The film closes with the wreath of orange blossoms encircling a bridal party.","popularity":0.1589,"poster_path":"/jIyuLXvONumXTuin4kq7xLyDuNf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowns, II: The Crown of Thorns","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émile Cohl","original_name":"Émile Cohl","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/pQ9gkv6SkohobpGlzxMqGYfWd6G.jpg","credit_id":"56e2c36bc3a3687005002c6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1003427","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jIyuLXvONumXTuin4kq7xLyDuNf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1909-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les couronnes (Émile Cohl, 1909) / Вінки та корони","key":"qKM9XapNUVI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-28T09:25:52.000Z","id":"66a8d3f6936bdaf30acd16c0"}]}}}
