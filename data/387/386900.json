The three of us saw Kazem Ala, an Iranian student and political exile, briefly interviewed on a local cable access show in Austin, Texas and were very moved by his story. We spent a month filming his day to day life in Houston, during the Iranian-American hostage crisis of 1980. The film was meant to describe in subtle ways what it is to be a political exile in times of political crisis.  PBS found it to be a little too subtle, and declined to air it nationally, but the film was televised on various individual PBS outlets,  and seeing it recently, I was struck by how, a generation later, we're still dealing with this same situation  - the clash between Islam and the West.  The Presidents and Ayatollahs may have changed, but politically, things are still at crisis level. - Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resident Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"625f05c2d4cc8e0051a197da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f065d3d74540068700412","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f066c25cd85009a20639d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"625f067325cd8500667f9980","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Anthony","original_name":"Alexandra Anthony","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f0698d1a8930051727451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Anthony","original_name":"Alexandra Anthony","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f069f3d7454009fd45dce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"56e2c81792514143a1000db8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Negroponte","original_name":"Michel Negroponte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e2c82492514178910027df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"572ae31392514106ec001520","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0337090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
