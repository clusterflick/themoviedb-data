Ultimo is a 90-minute black-and-white silent film, with scenes from the director's meanderings in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) interspersed with lines from Rizal's poem, which was written a day before the hero's execution in 1896. Waiting, ambivalence, and re-membering —themes usually tackled in literature and criticism— are investigated through a series of images: the mundane elevated to the affective through a sensibility that does not shy away from pushing the boundaries of art. This version is scored by a post-kundiman duet of guitar and banduria.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/joGTyhjc5b7smCxgxEPjpGRFr7n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kamias Road","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultimo: Different Ways of Killing a National Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ultimo: Different Ways of Killing a National Hero","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2986472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Lorenzo","original_name":"Teresa Lorenzo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6033508a9af171003d4600de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2986473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia Blanco","original_name":"Celia Blanco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60335095befb09003f9187f2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"56ded862925141579d001ade","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"56ded85bc3a36803ce002fa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"6033503ad38b580042f15a2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lawrence S.
