The next view shows the Emperor Charlemagne crowning his son Lewis. The film closes with the wreath of orange blossoms encircling a bridal party.","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":"/aTDSAYgQEh4gSIa7SWzAEh5Ur6M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowns, I: The Crown of Roses","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Laurels","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Carl","original_name":"Renée Carl","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/xKw1iQS28Z7fMGhbNhNk7gyMkYL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56e2c28d92514143cc000caa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Tissot","original_name":"Alice Tissot","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/8WZGSLi8NdkIB6lsmGvXUHO2fcS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56e2c29892514178a70027d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Wague","original_name":"Georges Wague","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56e2c2a4925141026100282e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émile Cohl","original_name":"Émile Cohl","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/pQ9gkv6SkohobpGlzxMqGYfWd6G.jpg","credit_id":"56e2c2659251410261002820","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1003426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTDSAYgQEh4gSIa7SWzAEh5Ur6M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1909-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les couronnes (Émile Cohl, 1909)","key":"qKM9XapNUVI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-28T09:25:52.000Z","id":"62570712d400f30050f93f4f"}]}}}
