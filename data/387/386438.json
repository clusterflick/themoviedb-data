Award-winning animator Co Hoedeman combines 3-D and cut-out animation techniques to create a very dramatic and moving film. The story follows Charles and François through the different stages of their lives. With time, they become closer, common experiences having diminished the difference in age. By the end of the film, time appears to stand still; both are over one hundred years old and they are almost indistinguishable.","popularity":0.4154,"poster_path":"/w6SWye1r4SUnIx89qrg0W9uanLN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charles and François","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Ryshpan","original_name":"Howard Ryshpan","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"56def6f59251412eee0000b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Shepperd","original_name":"Michael Shepperd","popularity":0.225,"profile_path":"/eO7C3kLhdcvQPkiuGS6Bo5IEkGa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56def6fe9251412ef40000cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1546604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Sorgini","original_name":"Linda Sorgini","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/uQgdtQkGBQFX3EMh7oNrFblr3k8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56def707c3a368748c0000c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":181018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandi Stahlbrand","original_name":"Sandi Stahlbrand","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56def7139251412ef40000d5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Len Watt","original_name":"Len Watt","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56def71e9251412ee70000bf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1118421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Yaroshevskaya","original_name":"Kim Yaroshevskaya","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/sViwJSaMaBcibVbc4Y6tBEq3hjh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67844614c81acaa63dbbe789","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Co Hoedeman","original_name":"Co Hoedeman","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/y9G2oaPIpDJ1V016vqdWeHGGQGH.jpg","credit_id":"56def7429251412ee70000c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":405893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Dompierre","original_name":"François Dompierre","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/57QYxYGmlABVIKg2uWFCrQ09zn.jpg","credit_id":"56def74dc3a36874800000db","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092742","wikidata_id":"Q59278115","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zqQyUHWkMnCv0ic8zekHSiSZ4Wo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1380,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6SWye1r4SUnIx89qrg0W9uanLN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
