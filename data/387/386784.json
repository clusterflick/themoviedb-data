The title says it all; the work is an imaginative world of insects consisting of images, combined with birds, as there are toads and snakes to see. The theme is the eternal cycle of life, birth, sex and death. The structure of the film images is constant change. TROLLSLÄNDOR MED FÅGLAR OCH ORM is a composition of images and contains of many frames of 16 mm film. Some images are self-recorded, others are taken from scientific film material and combining the images like in a collage, TROLLSLÄNDOR MED FÅGLAR OCH ORM examines the mysterial grey zone of image and imagination.
