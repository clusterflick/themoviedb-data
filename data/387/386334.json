Sparrooabbán (Me and my little sister) shows what it’s like to be a minority within a minority. Suvi describes how her little sister Kaisa wishes to be accepted as she is. Like her sister, Kaisa is a Sami, but also in a relationship with a woman, and she also works as a deacon. There are obviously more constricting communities in the film than only one.","popularity":0.7898,"poster_path":"/jY1qUI4RvhePRU6GakSHqinQuPk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74022,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vaski Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2016-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me and My Little Sister","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Minä ja pikkusiskoni","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Jag och min lillasyster","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Little Sister","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1587718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suvi West","original_name":"Suvi West","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56de3dd5c3a36803d4000dc5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1587727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaisa West","original_name":"Kaisa West","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56de422ec3a36803d4000ea2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563328,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erik Andersson","original_name":"Erik Andersson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3ea3c3a36803c8000d40","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1587718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suvi West","original_name":"Suvi West","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3e34c3a36803ce000e86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1528724,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hanna Kuirinlahti","original_name":"Hanna Kuirinlahti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3f18c3a36803bf000cbb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587720,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anja Ahola","original_name":"Anja Ahola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3e279251413504000c5b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587723,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gry Elisabeth Mortensen","original_name":"Gry Elisabeth Mortensen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3f6a9251413504000ca2","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587721,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakop Jannssønn","original_name":"Jakop Jannssønn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3f269251413501000cad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ville Langfeldt","original_name":"Ville Langfeldt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3f34c3a36803c6000d31","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587724,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janne Niskala","original_name":"Janne Niskala","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56de3f7b9251413507000c28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3586864","wikidata_id":"Q26835976","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jY1qUI4RvhePRU6GakSHqinQuPk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11529,"name":"conservatism"},{"id":15136,"name":"female homosexuality"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":239504,"name":"sapmi"},{"id":258394,"name":"sami people"},{"id":260092,"name":"sámi culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"S","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"Inari Skabamagovat Film Festival","release_date":"2016-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
