For as long as he can remember, his family has lived in and off the Australian bush, often as timber-getters in the coastal valleys of New South Wales. Vic is a bullocky, one of the last of his kind. In this film Vic talks about his life and work, his bullocks and his friends. The area where he works is very much a part of another Australia, now past, but Vic and his surroundings represent the best of it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bullocky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1813211","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
