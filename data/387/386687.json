Jo is the bright spark in Claireâ€™s recently darkened reality; a new friend in an otherwise isolated world. The two young women hit the town to let off some steam-and find themselves in trouble with local law enforcement. In the blink of an eye, Claire discovers that Jo is not what she seems-not at all-and her easy friendship with the lighthearted, young woman splits open to reveal the truth. Luminously shot in black and white, Josephine Doe is a raw exploration of family trauma and mental health that shows the thin line between our realities.","popularity":1.3431,"poster_path":"/dddw96PHoVaheCBMz6jyPgv1K93.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Byrdhouse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josephine Doe","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1513992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Cipolletti","original_name":"Erin Cipolletti","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"56e21f5dc3a3686ff9000a0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Griffin","original_name":"Emma Griffin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Josephine","credit_id":"5ae00c4fc3a3683d8900b47a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Bennett","original_name":"Elisabeth Bennett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Angie","credit_id":"5b4cbf559251417d0d03418c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Michael","original_name":"Ryan Michael","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae00c05c3a3683d9400c148","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1513992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Cipolletti","original_name":"Erin Cipolletti","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae00c11925141106200ae04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085621,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Brad Porter","original_name":"Brad Porter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4cbef70e0a26454003e074","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085625,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Lynn Deis","original_name":"Michael Lynn Deis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4cbf19c3a36823db030a46","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4421800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"josephinedoe2014","instagram_id":"josephinedoethemovie","twitter_id":"josephine_doe"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AgWbf4oNFOvLjHDIA67l8wZYdIn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8TiYDRBjvDTJIO0PRsDcVsBq88n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dddw96PHoVaheCBMz6jyPgv1K93.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Josephine Doe Official Trailer","key":"d3_7mfuLCko","published_at":"2018-01-03T01:09:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5b4cc0b6c3a36823ea03e113"}]}}}
