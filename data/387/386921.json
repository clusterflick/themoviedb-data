One of the best of the series. Writes Kuchar: \"Set in central Oklahoma during May, I spend 3 weeks in a motel and get talked at by a small weather-radio that seems to rule my life. I, myself, get to talk at the lady who runs the motel and who runs a cosmetic empire downtown. The viewer gets to see her equipment and her corner of the world as storms lurk somewhere off-camera, waiting to enter stage left and bring down the house. This is one of the more social installments of the weather diary series.\"","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":"/pis9Ufz89GtUeOcWrHaMDhf1j9C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weather Diary 5","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"56e2e92bc3a368354e000223","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"56e2e936925141560700015b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5402676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pis9Ufz89GtUeOcWrHaMDhf1j9C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
