But although the region appears to be idyllic, its inhabitants are struggling with big problems. The villages and cities of Pomerania that traditionally live from agriculture are hit by unemployment rates of up to 75% after the meltdown of the state farms. While most of the young people leave the region, some of them take their chances and start fresh – for instance, a young couple that tries to rebuild an agricultural farm with the help of EU funding. Furthermore, older inhabitants, including a spry 90-year old retiree from the Uckermark region who grew up in Pomerania, tell stories about the region′s eventful past.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/xuphcfVsfORQAtiuEYon7jdkncp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pommerland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"56e19f3bc3a3680a260030c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"56e19f43c3a3680a1a00319d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593940dd92514108990107a4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1012231,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gudrun Steinbrück","original_name":"Gudrun Steinbrück","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593940ec9251410895010683","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rainer Böhm","original_name":"Rainer Böhm","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59394103c3a368783f010276","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0765136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xuphcfVsfORQAtiuEYon7jdkncp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
