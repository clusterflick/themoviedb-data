The film explores the changing landscape by interviewing small business owners, financial analysts, and a very senior retail executive (all from the same family) who helped run several large department store chains, including Bealls in Texas, PA Bergner in IL, and Venture dept stores, a division of the May company headquartered in St. Louis, MO. The film explores the seeds of manufacturing migrating to overseas and the loss of jobs as well as consolidation. The film explores the question as to whether it's just the normal evolution of business or the death of something vital - American, middle class jobs.","popularity":0.4386,"poster_path":"/eEZpBloPIjg2xksVR45v4vX2HVp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The 4th film in the MAGA film chronicles, The Death (Change) of an Industry explores the migrating business landscape through the prism of the Retailing industry.","title":"The Death (Change) of an Industry: The Evolution (Collapse) of Retailing","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance F.
