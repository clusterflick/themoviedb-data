Filmed indoors, Monte Tropic gradually travels towards a more indefinite and dreamlike space to question the memories and desires of these young people, whose inactivity vindicates their right to be above the disastrous political use of their situation.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/5912olODATXe2rPfyVALstw22H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78523,"logo_path":"/tlptuYlIEOmXlb4PnuJXj6R4H3A.png","name":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mount Tropic, A Story of the Lockdown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mount Tropic, A Story of the Lockdown","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Monte Tropic","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Duque","original_name":"Andrés Duque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hXqbr9aKaINFLAej23jPk694or4.jpg","credit_id":"6386a91d229ae215b4602457","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3808146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margot Mecca","original_name":"Margot Mecca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6386ae66a410c800792197bc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJD2LhKbefuzAMaJ4l4I0sb7tHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xi18pYskSIyv81hjdxGWkXd8l5r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPZZXqDlCMtcgssGNxwiXbk7MEc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lMqfod7PBDammL3NZULyhycTNpV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sdQVv3t6cLgf58PQuiHfbfYgnzc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lA2oFgen9Ems10D0bs21ccdiVau.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxB2igvcEpd2KbaQXwwcZH58Z2I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lXoPYtYKOXMYHDQIPiz9VBKbXMl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8XxST12zBKgcQwlECkhCNifK4Mm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jR6rxsEHlcMMMhq3x8ox1N63T7Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4VHiD33YV7N4rQSXproAy4owbS2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/5912olODATXe2rPfyVALstw22H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/m2pVlTGfd6xZjIWUiI1rlHVgm4z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Documenta Madrid","release_date":"2022-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Monte Tropic - Tráiler","key":"uZpIFjmb8U8","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-09T16:15:34.000Z","id":"6387d0bf8ee49c00c844b0da"}]}}}
