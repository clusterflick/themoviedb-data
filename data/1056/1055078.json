The documentary's main protagonists - Václav Havel, banned singer Marta Kubisová, and the underground rock group the Plastic People of the Universe (PPU) - became the most recognizable dissidents during the 1970-80s. Havel bridged the disparate clusters of individuals and fused the literary, musical, political, and philosophical nonviolent elements into a hybrid network that eventually toppled the totalitarian regime in 1989.","popularity":0.8581,"poster_path":"/9aLDoZgH0h7SnXuZ8g0c3uK98oV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93964,"logo_path":null,"name":"FRMOL production","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Dissent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Umění disentu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3442906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Garton Ash","original_name":"Timothy Garton Ash","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/gwR7DdeJjqVim8kd2k2m5HM0TpQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"64adf0a31cfe3a00e4c520a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Bakewell","original_name":"Joan Bakewell","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/rhej0oHwiT28FciJNATXKbC8MBc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"BBC Interviewer - BBC Archival Film","credit_id":"64adf0d33e2ec800af7f66a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Bassey","original_name":"Shirley Bassey","popularity":0.1467,"profile_path":"/xxv3ysU956aXb69gRMwqMs2zrrs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Subject (archive footage)","credit_id":"64adf0e2b686b9015011d439","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4158148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamila Bendova","original_name":"Kamila Bendova","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"64adf0f2b686b9015011d45b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Gorbachev","original_name":"Михаил Горбачёв","popularity":0.4351,"profile_path":"/kiKZ3XR760LyBZ8YvNdZf6EFFzl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Subject (archive footage)","credit_id":"64adf0fb66a0d300c6706dc6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenzin Gyatso","original_name":"Tenzin Gyatso","popularity":0.162,"profile_path":"/dAtWYY56kQURZFKmdgrCTkakXTw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Subject (archive footage)","credit_id":"64adf104b686b9010e0df782","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert F.
