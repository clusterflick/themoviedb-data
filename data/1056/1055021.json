Everyone that is except for Brian. Don't let his guitar string salesman facade fool you. Brian used to play for the \"B-movie Nightmares\", but quit before they got big. Now the TV news says Brad OD'd, but Brian's going to find out what really happened. Was it a simple overdose or was there foul play? And if there was foul play, then who's to blame? A jaded drummer? A Korean Cowboy? A Satanic Ronald Reagan?! Brian asks \"just one more thing\" [ala Columbo] in his quest to seek out the truth. But no one said it'd be just another leisurely Sunday murder mystery. And it certainly won't be as polite.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overdose: Death of a Punk Rocker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kareem Ghuneim","original_name":"Kareem Ghuneim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Brian","credit_id":"67eab077700a6a94c6e5a663","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chadsworth Garza","original_name":"Chadsworth Garza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Brad Stanley","credit_id":"67eab090700a6a94c6e5a679","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Thorne","original_name":"Christian Thorne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Snarf","credit_id":"67eab104b5997a0261e56f49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maye Hunta","original_name":"Maye Hunta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marley Burroughs","credit_id":"67eab1204f741c75bbc6e2f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Phipps","original_name":"Christopher Phipps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Darrell Franks","credit_id":"67eab1764f741c75bbc6e31a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3685364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Ackles","original_name":"Barbara Ackles","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kathy Green","credit_id":"67eab1bacf32ef1634f6d7a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoinette Anders","original_name":"Antoinette Anders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Candace","credit_id":"67eab2053fca90d2dff70939","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elijah Beckett","original_name":"Elijah Beckett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Policeman Hank, Pool Servant","credit_id":"67eab22862235c6581c6c95f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Canik","original_name":"Sarah Canik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Guitar Store Customer","credit_id":"67eab28b2cca6fc8fbc70d5d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Davila","original_name":"George Davila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Concert Goer","credit_id":"67eab2acaf752a3b24f7292a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Duong","original_name":"Amanda Duong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Sweatshop Laborer","credit_id":"67eab2c961cac2b3a3f70759","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Duong","original_name":"Ethan Duong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Sweatshop Laborer","credit_id":"67eab2e1af752a3b24f72941","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Faust","original_name":"Lindsay Faust","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Door Gir","credit_id":"67eab2fc61cac2b3a3f70774","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darius G.","original_name":"Darius G.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Frouche Man â€¢ The Press Corpse","credit_id":"67eab322af752a3b24f7295c","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.J.
