During this sensational hour, Sugarland presents a versatile set that gains momentum with each song. \"Joey\" is heartbreakingly sincere, \"Everyday America\" reveals strong, twangy vocals while broken-down acoustics give \"Stay\" a more traditional country sound. Their forte is to effortlessly transition from energetic pop songs to heartfelt, soulful ballads without skipping a beat. The dynamic duo also present older classics like \"Baby Girl\" and even venture into covers of R.E.M to pay homage to shared Atlanta roots during their set.","popularity":0.3381,"poster_path":"/guFr8WSzB51NVEAxNSFTJjphLLd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugarland: The Incredible Machine","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1546496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Nettles","original_name":"Jennifer Nettles","popularity":0.9899,"profile_path":"/s6IDogtE93cMaMe4EYBjUeXVOV4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6387dd711b157d0082468a11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristian Bush","original_name":"Kristian Bush","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6387dd9b8ee49c00844f6031","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thad Beaty","original_name":"Thad Beaty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6387ddb1a410c8008484dc05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Clements","original_name":"Annie Clements","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6387ddc2d388ae00c889e427","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Bush","original_name":"Brandon Bush","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6387dde80398ab00c839b620","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Aaron McNabb","original_name":"Travis Aaron McNabb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6387de038ee49c00844f604b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Thomas","original_name":"Joe Thomas","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":"/oCZODqb1KCnSGxqdWsRKp1IMAvz.jpg","credit_id":"6387dd45229ae215b4609986","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1887882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fR70U6UoTQDRrXFfEHElb2lTV2D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/guFr8WSzB51NVEAxNSFTJjphLLd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
