Kamikaze means wind of God in Japanese. During WW2 Japanese pilots attacked American aircraft carriers and army ships by dive-bombing their airplanes. For the realization of the second project, I transcribed a part of the diary of another kamikaze soldier from southern Japan, Norimitsu Takushima. By putting in his place a fictional French character, Noé Teissier, this translation sits in a broader contemporary context. The film ultimately reflects relationships to life, to death, to love speaking towards the universal experiences of any soldier.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/twX16GnQMir87M8BveqIJ2MYxuF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3810040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Rudel","original_name":"Félix Rudel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Noé Teissier","credit_id":"6388ad9b2e0697024d2c7899","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danilo Sekic","original_name":"Danilo Sekic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Capitaine","credit_id":"6388adab2e06970292e5dff9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3810043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Rodet","original_name":"Pauline Rodet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Adèle","credit_id":"6388adb92e06970292e5e006","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2474855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvain Baumann","original_name":"Sylvain Baumann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Collégue de Noé","credit_id":"6388adcea410c80079225e9e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2593820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyoko Kasuya","original_name":"Kyoko Kasuya","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6388acf6229ae215542a2ad9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094511,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toco Vervisch","original_name":"Toco Vervisch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6388ad210398ab008fad7af2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2593820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyoko Kasuya","original_name":"Kyoko Kasuya","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6388ad0c1b157d00b788748b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2593820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyoko Kasuya","original_name":"Kyoko Kasuya","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ec23dc6b570401632fbd33","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/twX16GnQMir87M8BveqIJ2MYxuF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
