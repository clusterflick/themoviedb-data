As part of the festival, NWS hosted a new video installation entitled NWS: 4’33″, created by New York-based composer, director, performer and recording artist Mikel Rouse; which consisted of video performances contributed by Cage fans via a special YouTube site set up by Rouse. The public was invited to record and submit their own video, and visit the installation during the festival to see their work in the SunTrust Pavilion at the New World Center. These videos will be included in an online Archive of the event, a lasting tribute to this defining and seminal artist.","popularity":0.145,"poster_path":"/rZCCgmgnxgI4IfO0sK2QEZJ6RdS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209029,"logo_path":null,"name":"eDream Institute","origin_country":""},{"id":209030,"logo_path":null,"name":"The National Center for Supercomputing Applications","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Wall Installation of John Cage’s 4’33″","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"NWS: 4’33″","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3388802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Rouse","original_name":"Mikel Rouse","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/qRiTO9LaO4FORujbgpSOMfKV5PU.jpg","credit_id":"6388b9951b157d008246e725","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cage","original_name":"John Cage","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/9gmtnfJV6dO81hNzxr2Nm3UGeNv.jpg","credit_id":"65c51919e258600163ea97f6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rZCCgmgnxgI4IfO0sK2QEZJ6RdS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":244417,"name":"art installation"},{"id":274386,"name":"silence"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Making the Right Choices: A John Cage Centennial Celebration Festival","release_date":"2013-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
