A send up of a current-affairs show, 1980 pokes fun at subjects ranging from the current state of the Canadian film industry, academics, the student radicals of the 60s to Hollywood depictions of the Holocaust. Steven Kampmann stars along with Finkleman and Moranis. Also featuring Toronto salesman Phil Givner, Andrew Gilles, Caroline Yeager and the late comedy producer, Joe Bodolai. 1980 shown courtesy of CBC.","popularity":0.4467,"poster_path":"/kNwlnDQO95YcfpoOLsBL8WdUdqn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1980","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Finkleman","original_name":"Ken Finkleman","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/crXQvJ2XM92IS9N54ZY0ML6FI1G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6539096c7fcab3010b01126c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Moranis","original_name":"Rick Moranis","popularity":1.7976,"profile_path":"/rVZbTJjM4g0Um6trlLHRiBzBO7t.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65390975f495ee00ff6644e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Kampmann","original_name":"Steven Kampmann","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/lZrOn5q11e9mSe7QpLdGX7PwC4a.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65390985ae3668012c672968","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Givner","original_name":"Phil Givner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6539099b946318013ad7d6cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Gillies","original_name":"Andrew Gillies","popularity":0.4157,"profile_path":"/u2kf1FH3GsniNA5QwPOCx0xzfiT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"653909aef495ee00e2c581ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":199842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Yeager","original_name":"Caroline Yeager","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":"/1I5HRUC4avEcxR2bLTbj5gTmw4T.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"653909baae366800c9117a01","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bodolai","original_name":"Joe Bodolai","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"653909c4f495ee00e2c581c8","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Finkleman","original_name":"Ken Finkleman","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/crXQvJ2XM92IS9N54ZY0ML6FI1G.jpg","credit_id":"63877bf31b157d00971835b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"JewishFilmFests","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q105SbMUrXWResKSJFtOCjcwd9f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kNwlnDQO95YcfpoOLsBL8WdUdqn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
