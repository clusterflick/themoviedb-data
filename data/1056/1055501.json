In the 1990s, the French humorists Les Inconnus made a remake of this TV show, where the invaders are migrants living in France. Transforming the aliens into migrants was a cynical gesture that also showed the absurdity of the extreme right discourses of the time. This video is a remake of this remake, where the world has gone upside down and the attraction from the Global South to Europe has also been reversed.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/q9X8og4esHvGmGXVgnHhso4WuCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invaders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2904900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ghita Skali","original_name":"Ghita Skali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638801afa410c800a435212d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1476,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q9X8og4esHvGmGXVgnHhso4WuCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.artland.com/exhibitions/the-invaders","release_date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
