Film director Niko von Glasow brings together a company of performers to conceive and perform a new stage comedy. In the play, a group of physically and mentally disabled hopefuls show up to audition for a TV talent show. They are sent to a separate and suitable room, where they are forgotten. Believe it or not, this up-close and often upsetting documentary is full of laughter, fun and moments of genuine theatrical magic.","popularity":0.1403,"poster_path":"/vNP3BOVcoxXFyPZGpgWNdvxqtCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Will Be Alright","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3727248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jana Zöll","original_name":"Jana Zöll","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"633cb7624df291007acfd893","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2002770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico Randel","original_name":"Nico Randel","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"633cb7686d000c0091db77d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3727249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirco Monshausen","original_name":"Mirco Monshausen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"633cb771006b01007f27bc7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3727250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manon Wetzel","original_name":"Manon Wetzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"633cb7774df291007d6d0865","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Grice","original_name":"Oliver Grice","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"633cb77ecf48a1007dbcaa53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3727251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Zajber","original_name":"Christina Zajber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"633cb7856d000c0091db77f2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niko von Glasow","original_name":"Niko von Glasow","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633cb750481382007aa0dfee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2208172","wikidata_id":"Q101208831","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNP3BOVcoxXFyPZGpgWNdvxqtCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
