The Bridge is a piece of geometry so I figured the film had to be geometric, too. The matte box allowed me to create postcards within postcards within postcards. It was all done in-camera…very demanding, it took all winter! The matting had to be carefully calculated and each image rewound by hand, then rephotographed, in the right position and at the right exposure. I surrounded the Bridge with a mass of water…vertically and horizontally. The water is by turns soft and then metallic as it reflects in the low winter sun. The movement, the steel and the water create an interplay as harbour sounds, wind chimes, boats…tinkle.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/dQUSY7ggeFAFH0uLzB8uCqKOiLo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1977-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sydney Harbour Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"5cd6e82a0e0a263080cbdd96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQUSY7ggeFAFH0uLzB8uCqKOiLo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZH1Tl5v3TaEE0AoODOUANuRQq1.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":570},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/XWbQSZdiGgylrke27KbfvrVA0d.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oMr7UB4tm7SDfGJDp0z53Q2SfBs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Paul Winkler  Sydney Harbour Bridge (Excerpt)","key":"TGXzmWsSek0","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2009-05-18T22:00:54.000Z","id":"6091b8b4e8d0b40040f98640"}]}}}
