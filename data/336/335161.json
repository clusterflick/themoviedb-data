John Atanasoff, a physics professor at Iowa State College, needed a better calculator that could quickly solve advanced equations and when he tried to find such a machine, realized none existed. So Atanasoff decided he must build his own calculator. Through archive material, reenactments, interviews with experts and first hand witnesses this documentary shines a light to controversy over who was the actual inventor of the computer and an unknown part of our history.","popularity":0.1617,"poster_path":"/aQNv6swOmAcXytpnClH4UpGaCLH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atanasoff: The Father of the Computer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mila Aung-Thwin","original_name":"Mila Aung-Thwin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5526ec72c3a3687e03004649","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Cross","original_name":"Daniel Cross","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/fTn02qt67eL0bI9dVfdvgntLWwa.jpg","credit_id":"58715b27925141356400d078","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQNv6swOmAcXytpnClH4UpGaCLH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6104,"name":"computer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
