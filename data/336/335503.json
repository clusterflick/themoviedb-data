The officer is most grateful and puts the soldier in line for a Victoria Cross (a medal for valor). Unfortunately the well-meaning major's actions cause the soldier to be extradited back to England where he must stand trial for a series of crimes he committed before he joined the military. Later the major scours the British jails in search of the heroic lad. He finally finds him recruiting soldiers for WW I.","popularity":0.7046,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Valour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Walls","original_name":"Tom Walls","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/8F4gUNjw6eCDi9df4J7ehAwA5fx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Doubleday","credit_id":"552a82db925141265f001991","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Lynn","original_name":"Ralph Lynn","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/4uSONaRUMq43hDJXE1cVU5Jn1Cl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Major Pyke","credit_id":"552a82e4c3a36858d60037bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1284609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Rose","original_name":"Veronica Rose","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Phyllis Chisholm","credit_id":"552a82edc3a368596e003817","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Marion","original_name":"Joan Marion","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":"/sb2Ot5g7XE3MmcgqzkC3VT8HWCu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clare Chester","credit_id":"552a82f692514111d60048fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Harben","original_name":"Hubert Harben","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Gallop","credit_id":"552a83089251414b79003cd5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
