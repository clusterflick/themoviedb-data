A little funding from Germany finally got me there. I had read a lot about the history and mythology of the Rock and of the Aboriginal people, but I was only too aware that I, as a European, could never hope to get into or feel that mythology. So I decided to make a film about it from my perspective. I cut out all these mythological figures…lizards, emus, wallabies…some of them from drawings in caves on the Rock, and carefully employed them as mattes for footage I shot in real time. In those days hotels were very close to Ayers Rock [now known as Uluru], so I never had to go very far with my camera. I used filters and telephoto lenses to suggest a kind of unknowable aura…to show that there was truly something out there on that flat plain.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/nPzlxYmP4wq5capiHuXlKnmeFA4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ayers Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"57124dae9251410aab003104","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0144090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPzlxYmP4wq5capiHuXlKnmeFA4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aeK31W1M5PmS8qgElvtYGvqv0Fc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Paul Winkler  Ayers Rock","key":"NE5Z3nt0A88","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2009-05-18T22:07:34.000Z","id":"6091b88a528b2e0058471f85"}]}}}
