First of all, he has big plans for the new phase of his life: he can finally make up for a missed togetherness with his wife Charlotte, a successful scientist who will soon follow him into retirement, and write his long-awaited novel. The reality, however, soon turns out to be far less romantic: Charlotte has little time for her husband because of her job, and Peter can't even get past the first sentence in his novel.","popularity":0.3761,"poster_path":"/cxtN26WJzvQYmgoFKH0g1YjliCW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Was
