Herein find tangled texts and crossed destinies, filled with figures at once buried deep and tossed high by History, lined with traces of a hidden romance.  Love finds purchase between tightly shelved volumes. In the spaces between the letters. In the lines themselves. An antinomian cinema seems possible. A gentle iconoclasm? The image is always backwards in a mirror. The story unfolds slowly. The fourth film from the Byrd project.\"  - David Gatten","popularity":0.064,"poster_path":"/zlQ6e56GlcOcePbcigXD8vWC7E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Art of Knowing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1076451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gatten","original_name":"David Gatten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sALyIeLWitHtT21x3ql47oYar7r.jpg","credit_id":"5527ea40c3a36818f50000c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s5RjeCR70FwqMxU6ho5op511N76.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zlQ6e56GlcOcePbcigXD8vWC7E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Florida Experimental Film/Video Festival","release_date":"2004-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
