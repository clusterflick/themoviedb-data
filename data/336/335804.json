Centuries later in Jodhpur, India, the Hanuman langurs are fighting still. Comprised of 20 or more females and their young, and governed by a ‘Warlord, ‘ 29 langur ‘gangs’ have carved up the city between them. Warlords reign for three or four years before they’re overthrown. When a new Warlord comes to power he will purge the gang of young males, creating a society of ‘Lost Boys’ whose only chance is to violently displace another Warlord. Natural selection is harsh indeed, but what better way to build a culture of warriors?","popularity":0.4226,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkey Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Lemmon","original_name":"Mike Lemmon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552dbdd6c3a36872ef0009ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Chapman","original_name":"Phil Chapman","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/f1j9z2vnVUTZU5Ir5mUI2RkTJ0D.jpg","credit_id":"552dbdb3c3a3686be2001117","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":15149,"name":"monkey"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
