Using simple illustrations, geologist Dr. Andrew Snelling examines these assumptions and equips viewers with information to counter their anti-biblical arguments.  Though this topic can seem intimidating, Dr. Snelling boils it down to laymans level and walks the viewer through a basic understanding of the process used to date rocks and fossils. Using simple illustrations, the assumptions used to arrive at dates are exposed as faultyâ€”and the evolutionary timescale along with them. Then, through several lines of evidence, including carbon-14 found in diamonds and fossils, the inconsistent nature of radiometric ages is revealed. Find our how creationists can turn this apparent foe into a friend by starting with Scripture as the ultimate authority!","popularity":0.1904,"poster_path":"/qHPI0IGEXQqfLH5XcP12jNYtx1S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Turning foe into friend","title":"Radioactive and Radiocarbon Dating","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3294949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Snelling","original_name":"Andrew Snelling","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/14yjw3D58nDXpWAkLlo2tEOdiF5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"61a1888a180dea0064f28962","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qHPI0IGEXQqfLH5XcP12jNYtx1S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
