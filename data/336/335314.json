When Thilda is brought on board by a prestigious theatre in Ostend and wants to look suitably refined for the occasion, she borrows an expensive piece of family jewellery from Adam. However, a criminal gang staying in the same hotel as Adam and Thilda gets wind of the jewellery, and they cleverly manage to steal it and replace the real stones with fake ones. The precious loot now proceeds to pass through many different bouquets of white roses before ending up in the right hands again.","popularity":0.429,"poster_path":"/w1aRBoilTciMA6P9F8IY6wDPeXC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG
