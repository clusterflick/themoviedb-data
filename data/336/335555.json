He sang hits from the Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, and his solo career, interspersing stories along the way, adding the biographical song \"Prairie Town\" as a framing device. This 2014 set  generally has a lower energy level than the original recordings but the relaxed vibe is part of the appeal: it's not a race, it's a nostalgic stroll with the amiable Bachman. If you're on the same wavelength as him, it's an enjoyable way to pass the time.","popularity":0.1289,"poster_path":"/wzdk4Nfhb3ewgYnNFx94cQPE6hz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Music Canada","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Randy Bachman | Vinyl Tap Tour: Every Song Tells a Story","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Bachman","original_name":"Randy Bachman","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/83dHGMlvNp0X3I9SXCZfjPzyG8d.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"552ae418c3a3681f5c004df7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Barnard","original_name":"John Barnard","popularity":0.049,"profile_path":"/17SZNnaz4BwrAyij2tHydN4Rj5Y.jpg","credit_id":"552ae38c925141288b0003aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gilles Paquin","original_name":"Gilles Paquin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552ae3a7c3a36858d600415c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyle Bornais","original_name":"Kyle Bornais","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552ae3b99251410876003fca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1453415,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Scott R.
