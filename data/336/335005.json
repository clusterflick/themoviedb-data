Mason, the head of the telegraph line work crew, assumes his ancestor's trade-mark mask (but not whip) in order to prevent a local czar (Roy Barcroft) from sabotaging the burgeoning telegraph line. Pamela Blake, a brunette starlet formerly known as Adele Pearce, played Mason's imperiled girlfriend, and the serial also benefitted from the usual competent work of Republic's great stunt-performers, including Dale van Sickel, Tom Steele, Eddie Parker, and Joe Yrigoyen.","popularity":1.9147,"poster_path":"/3qGQXojA8NevK6D7n1gibO8Um80.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"NEVER SUCH COURAGE NEVER SUCH DARING NEVER SUCH RIDING NEVER SUCH THRILLS","title":"Ghost of Zorro","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clayton Moore","original_name":"Clayton Moore","popularity":0.8534,"profile_path":"/uJSufv1R4YcwB0scngTkYYJEjds.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ken Mason","credit_id":"59014610c3a36810d7003e3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Blake","original_name":"Pamela Blake","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/daJiet6yNySXEzECRx9moNeMnMz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Rita White","credit_id":"576a77dbc3a368224300089b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Barcroft","original_name":"Roy Barcroft","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/57EKCVAOfcNKNNcHBtkmp0cU9od.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hank Kilgore","credit_id":"59014620c3a3681123004706","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George J.
