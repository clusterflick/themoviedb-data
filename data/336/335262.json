Instead of starring a mysterious woman, the film stars a mysterious gray cat. The film is an unconventional narrative built around an afternoon catnap and blurs the lines between reality and dreams. With a hint of horror and a tone of suspense, this film pays homage to an avant-garde masterpiece of film history and offers a whimsical take on the feline enigma. Meows of the Afternoon is an inherently humorous re-imagining of an art film classic.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meows of the Afternoon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Gillen","original_name":"Mary Gillen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5527e689c3a36818f300005d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2554458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
