They linger in an environment of glossy remains, of toxic plants and transformed ethnographic and police photography. While the punk gives a speech on toxicity and a performance referencing early feminist art works, the drag queen reenacts an interview of Jean Genet from the â€˜80s and blames the filmmakers for exposing her to the police-like scenario of being filmed. The camera turns and depicts the space-off, the space outside the frame.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/88dHn8cCGIgKTOf14p4Ugrdqsz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toxic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Brooks Takashi","original_name":"Ginger Brooks Takashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5527dd1c92514108ba0001e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Hirsch","original_name":"Werner Hirsch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5527dd25c3a36844940001e1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauline Boudry","original_name":"Pauline Boudry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5527dd0292514108b3000200","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renate Lorenz","original_name":"Renate Lorenz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5527dd0ec3a36844970001ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88dHn8cCGIgKTOf14p4Ugrdqsz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hmIqI69mP9NbosNwyfRrroiCvxq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
