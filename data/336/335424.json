With a population of about 11,000 living on a total landmass of only 20 square miles – less than Manhattan – spread over nine low-lying atolls 600 miles to the north of Fiji, Tuvalu has been inhabited for over four millenia. The warm-spirited and highly community-oriented people of this ex-British colony struggle to survive economically while confronting the likelihood of having to evacuate their homeland en masse within the next 50 years.","popularity":0.4282,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":227263,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Television Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Disappearing of Tuvalu: Trouble in Paradise","type":"streaming"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lambert Wilson","original_name":"Lambert Wilson","popularity":0.9949,"profile_path":"/5Fx2vg8Qux0LcOFLAGJK6VzET.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"662bdfd8fea6e3011e4a50c3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1446539,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Christopher Horner","original_name":"Christopher Horner","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bdf9899259c011eee2bee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4676780,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gilliane Le Gallic","original_name":"Gilliane Le Gallic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bdfb9c1606a011c67eaf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1419852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Planete Documentary Channel","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Disappearing of Tuvalu: Trouble In Paradise - PREVIEW","key":"VWUtIZ0Zil0","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-05-17T22:10:29.000Z","id":"662be0c6cf4b8b012028fc48"}]}}}
