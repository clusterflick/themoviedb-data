In a recurring motif of Gérard Blain’s cinema, Pierre is taken under the wing of an older gay man, Hubert , who offers him work and financial security; but when Hubert makes advances to him, Pierre robs him and takes up with a group of radical leftists who are planning terrorist attacks. Without employment, Pierre loses Nathalie to child services and spirals into desperation, finally erupting in an act of horrific violence. An x-ray showing the largely undiagnosed sickness of its time, and a stern warning to ours.","popularity":0.2434,"poster_path":"/dsRlQD5oH62wtUp4CRY5KoeANWS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50989,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.O.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rebel","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Norbert","original_name":"Patrick Norbert","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"5528731392514111c8000601","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Subor","original_name":"Michel Subor","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/il6f0zTI3YZx6pEe13x1vEQo5eX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Beaufils","credit_id":"5528731c92514111d300064c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Rosais","original_name":"Isabelle Rosais","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nathalie","credit_id":"55287325c3a3681f56000696","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Aublanc","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Aublanc","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/t9iKVkTZcWpM2PbdnmtiexaLxd5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alain","credit_id":"5528732ec3a3681f59000611","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Michaud","original_name":"Françoise Michaud","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/40tTa9YmMg5YKhXdc69oZlAfxI3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Corinne","credit_id":"55287338c3a3681f500006dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Jérôme","original_name":"Alain Jérôme","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/f3jWYalVZF3NW9Hm8fIwGRMMOtV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jean-Claude","credit_id":"55287341c3a3681f59000616","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Blain","original_name":"Gérard Blain","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/pPYuPqx8NrieLkNpZhUKej5s3tx.jpg","credit_id":"5528735dc3a3681f620006a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1442267,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Geneviève Monteilh","original_name":"Geneviève Monteilh","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552873c892514111d00006c7","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Blain","original_name":"Gérard Blain","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/pPYuPqx8NrieLkNpZhUKej5s3tx.jpg","credit_id":"552872c7c3a3681f59000602","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1452470,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Debaecque","original_name":"André Debaecque","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5528736cc3a3681f620006ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39191,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emmanuel Machuel","original_name":"Emmanuel Machuel","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552873af92514111d3000665","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1452471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Lara","original_name":"Catherine Lara","popularity":0.1873,"profile_path":"/n4PKR3NhRYxcyDVdwjyBjqugGBC.jpg","credit_id":"67d363a0dcba70a26964e058","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0081405","wikidata_id":"Q3226285","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svKkOPtCsXg4SIafYIXecP6pcAp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dsRlQD5oH62wtUp4CRY5KoeANWS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/plr2ab5BIRP15LjZJBUhpK1GSdy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8ZE2t4G6anNO11xAcK5jwxPaBeR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
