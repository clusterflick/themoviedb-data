He denies all attempts to defend himself. Locked up, he waits for the arrival of \"Caleuche,\" the Ship (Nave) of Fools (de los locos), a mythical figure of his ancestral strength which \"made\" him start the fire. An appointed lawyer (a white woman) comes to the chief's defence, alleging the chief had acted in self-defense as the white man was building commercial structures on the sacred burial grounds of his ancestors, and continued doing so even after heated protests.","popularity":0.5051,"poster_path":"/x2PRrVxdrFqWNQYd2nA1HIWe5r5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship of Fools","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Paredes","original_name":"Marisa Paredes","popularity":0.3535,"profile_path":"/71esuRUCyeSyib35mTFPkR24zH7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julia Márquez","credit_id":"552e9b579251413fea001207","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Guillén","original_name":"Fernando Guillén","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/3NXbnoe3aVUi0SqBUYNVLu24GxW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Agustín Márquez","credit_id":"552e9b86925141383800274a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inés Estévez","original_name":"Inés Estévez","popularity":0.2336,"profile_path":"/zV57im2AguAXx42YzIscEXtuaB1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Laura Montero","credit_id":"552e9b9992514109650006fc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Ángel Solá","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Solá","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/jvkbzIBASI8H91kuN0z9bnLuQuB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Viale","credit_id":"552e9bbb9251413b3b000ab1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"China Zorrilla","original_name":"China Zorrilla","popularity":0.9439,"profile_path":"/leG6cjuFtfBwSHt2c9PeJdIdX12.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dra.
