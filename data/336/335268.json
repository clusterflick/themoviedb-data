I've returned to this spot many times since, making a series of underwater, cameraless films there (the WHAT THE WATER SAID series), always continuing to watch for the shrimp boats. I filmed these images during the summer and fall of 2006 and cut them over the next several years, using Leonardo da Vinci's Notebooks as a guide.\" - David Gatten","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/zgXHPZtwSlAWIoKZF8xRGnUmtap.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shrimp Boat Log","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1076451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gatten","original_name":"David Gatten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sALyIeLWitHtT21x3ql47oYar7r.jpg","credit_id":"5527e9a5925141476e000077","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgXHPZtwSlAWIoKZF8xRGnUmtap.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2010-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
