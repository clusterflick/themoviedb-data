He describes his absurd attempt of a new beginning – after Auschwitz and Buchenwald – in the Budapest of the Stalin area. Our photonovel transfers Kertész’ literary method into a visual language: the joining of fragmentary elements of the past and of the present, finding a trace that links experience and remembrance. From 2008 to 2010 approximately 800 colored medium-format photos were taken. The sequential photos have been taken on the original locations. The remainders of the past systems are rendered via multiple exposures, pictures shown in their ambivalence, mirroring etc. The literary text and the photographies remain independent from one another, however they enter into a dialog and open up space for associations. The course of movement caused by the juxtaposition of multiple still images is continued when one turns the pages (see chronophotography).\"","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiasko","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1454613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gusztáv Hámos","original_name":"Gusztáv Hámos","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/nEdomWo9MQQS1p8CP2PiyBbgmQW.jpg","credit_id":"552e924792514174db0077df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janet Riedel","original_name":"Janet Riedel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552e92c09251413fea00109a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Pratschke","original_name":"Katja Pratschke","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552e92cfc3a3686be20032cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2132,"name":"literature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
