Newfound social responsibilities are trampled underfoot when Ray's racist past is revived amid tensions between Whites and Asians jostling for position on the council housing list. Among those who are wanting to be rehoused in a new development is Ray's alcoholic ex-wife Sadie (Camille Coduri), and his teenage daughter Nikki (Sadie Thompson). After a failed attempt to rehouse Sadie and Nikki, and soon discovering that Nikki is involved in heroin addiction, Ray's anger drives him to re-join a BNP organisation led by his old friend Larry Knowles (Keith Barron).","popularity":1.1361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"England Expects","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Mackintosh","original_name":"Steven Mackintosh","popularity":0.7375,"profile_path":"/vDA4mmVe0XMnqd6qMyGWI8bUEeC.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ray Knight","credit_id":"552c47e1c3a368619e000e85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Vidler","original_name":"Susan Vidler","popularity":0.5097,"profile_path":"/AhTD7RyJu7rA2pN0h5gMl7xp5CK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"552c47e9c3a368619e000e87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Barron","original_name":"Keith Barron","popularity":0.4282,"profile_path":"/5Ux1oJWCn0mm06Thwp3ay8KCvoh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"552c47f4c3a36861a1000dcb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Coduri","original_name":"Camille Coduri","popularity":0.3112,"profile_path":"/vzzNfnKteOiuyXC1IxABapFrZaL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"552c48009251416ac0000a58","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Johnson","original_name":"Karl Johnson","popularity":0.6177,"profile_path":"/mXEFmNvs64YOB2AbBi7rZ57rTvW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"552c48109251413876000d17","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Preeya Kalidas","original_name":"Preeya Kalidas","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/qUu2rI2FjuwAaXfWGDGvpYJio8R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"552c481a9251413876000d1f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nitin Ganatra","original_name":"Nitin Ganatra","popularity":0.2459,"profile_path":"/gFvTl8vphafRHdqlEPWmVnV6DYT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"552c482fc3a368619e000e9b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam James","original_name":"Adam James","popularity":0.6885,"profile_path":"/5aVa1LgnOzkzsIYdcb1QUTxV5g3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"629b691a7e12f0721cbda31b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Smith","original_name":"Tony Smith","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552c48599251416ac0000ad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0382668","wikidata_id":"Q5377974","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
