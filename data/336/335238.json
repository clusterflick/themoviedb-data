He was actually a typographer. With “Trab Trab” he made an impish attempt to create a synthesis between Dadaism and New Objectivity. The film is a precise and elegant account of a racecourse. It does so without narration or images of either horses or patrons; everything we see has been captured either pre- or post-race.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/nHVzjpTIVguDkwr6aKpF3qSa1Im.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trot Trot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Detten Schleiermacher","original_name":"Detten Schleiermacher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5527dbd5c3a368449a000217","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622857,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ursel Werthner","original_name":"Ursel Werthner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2def5f839d93000fef7ac7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467689,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hans Loeper","original_name":"Hans Loeper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd5d50e2bca8001e8aca2d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wolf Wirth","original_name":"Wolf Wirth","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd5d588efe73001f158e85","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2335234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7PfxDXOFQObLDGUz4q9yXGD5Bmn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nHVzjpTIVguDkwr6aKpF3qSa1Im.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
