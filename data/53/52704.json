This compelling video throws into serious doubt the authenticity of the Apollo missions and features information that challenges the declared abilities of NASA to successfully send a man to the Moon and return him safely to Earth. New evidence clearly suggests that NASA hoaxed pictures allegedly taken on the lunar surface. These findings are supported by analysis and the testimony of experts from various disciplines, including photographer/filmmaker David S. Percy ARPS and physicist David Groves PhD. Hear what NASA has to say in response to these disturbing findings.","popularity":0.0599,"poster_path":"/tDuuZKCqlSjOTSoFoZA2hpKie22.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20555,"logo_path":"/hD8yEGUBlHOcfHYbujp71vD8gZp.png","name":"Taurus Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":224,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Happened on the Moon?","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":146517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David S.
