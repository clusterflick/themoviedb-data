On what side of it will you stand? Has the government our Founders created been forgotten by Washington DC? Is a Patriot Uprising ready to capture the spirit of 1776? \"Don't Tread On Me: Rise of the Republic\" gives the viewer a look into the movements, mindset, and legislation that will catapult the \"Great Restoration\" into households across America. What is the choke-collar the Federal Government uses to reign in the States? Are the States sovereign or subjects of Washington DC?
