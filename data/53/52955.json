However, Lucy tells them that she signed them up for camp. The girls are eager to go, but the boys hate the idea.(Linus adding that its like finding out that he was drafted.) The boys shove each other to get on the bus, while the girls line up in order. At camp, Charlie Brown is chosen captain of the boys camp. The boys and girls have a swim race which the girls win easily. Then they have a softball game, which the boys lose with only one run. Other competitions are just as lopsided. Afterwards, the boys sit around the campfire and reflect on how miserable they are. In one scene, the colors of the shirts of Schroder and Linus are mixed up during this scene.","popularity":0.6998,"poster_path":"/5AHXzz4NB4yrirsB5uneDurq0xv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lee Mendelson Film Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Melendez Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":52263,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Feature Syndicate","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":44,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Це було коротке літо, Чарлі Брауне","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Robbins","original_name":"Peter Robbins","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/5pLhG4JRs8oiTmyPTo7fkh2EfGK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Charlie Brown","credit_id":"56233e8292514171cd00cdd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamelyn Ferdin","original_name":"Pamelyn Ferdin","popularity":0.3394,"profile_path":"/em0fOtLG6wU9CTCbnX4baLQ6O2s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucy van Pelt","credit_id":"56233e92c3a3680e1d00d7b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Gilger","original_name":"Glenn Gilger","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Linus van Pelt","credit_id":"56233e9e92514171c500ce35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Altieri","original_name":"Ann Altieri","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/m3ZphW3oqMwRhdEH6so6ju81cb3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Frieda","credit_id":"56233eddc3a3680e1d00d7bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Carey","original_name":"David Carey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Shermy","credit_id":"56233eee9251417f4700a6db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Daschback","original_name":"John Daschback","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Schroeder","credit_id":"56233f04c3a3680e1600c0a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66897,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher DeFaria","original_name":"Christopher DeFaria","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/e7sPWVvfV9UfVNPegDlcf1z73su.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Peppermint Patty","credit_id":"5676e83492514179e3005edf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail DeFaria","original_name":"Gail DeFaria","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/bLJYQWrPWgnE8eI8bRNV0hHrbY1.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pigpen","credit_id":"56233f2cc3a3686868006f3e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Dryer","original_name":"Sally Dryer","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/c3uchpJrG2EEZZEWiF3ruBiEzYX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Shirley / Clara / Sophie","credit_id":"56233f3ac3a3680e1900ceea","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Liftin","original_name":"Matthew Liftin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Roy / Kid","credit_id":"56233f4fc3a3680e2000e0e6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94011,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Melendez","original_name":"Bill Melendez","popularity":0.3386,"profile_path":"/se2qF1kdaKTwDa69xjzA3j2gKaG.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Snoopy","credit_id":"56233f64c3a3680e0e00db9b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilary Momberger-Powers","original_name":"Hilary Momberger-Powers","popularity":0.2151,"profile_path":"/bcHimtCEdckLGfVGDBw6WYBICEG.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Sally Brown (voice, as Hilary Momberger)","credit_id":"5de7c1aca7e3630014722e2c","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94011,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Melendez","original_name":"Bill Melendez","popularity":0.3386,"profile_path":"/se2qF1kdaKTwDa69xjzA3j2gKaG.jpg","credit_id":"56233e3f92514171c500ce28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123945,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles M.
