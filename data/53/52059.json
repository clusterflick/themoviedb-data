The film reveals how the hard-liners within the government marginalized moderates among the protesters (including students, workers and intellectuals), while the actions of radical protesters undermined moderates in the government. Moderate voices were gradually cowed and then silenced by extremism and emotionalism on both sides.","popularity":0.6177,"poster_path":"/a097YNBiTFR9eryZPylZ2INwExz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gate of Heavenly Peace","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Tian An Men","type":"Pinyin"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Gordon","original_name":"Richard Gordon","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606b4ab60d2f530040a2f999","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carma Hinton","original_name":"Carma Hinton","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4816c3a36847f8157779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Crowley","original_name":"John Crowley","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dfb15ed2b209004db2e318","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geramie Barmé","original_name":"Geramie Barmé","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dfb14adc1cb4004facfa43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113147","wikidata_id":"Q7735912","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yXRxWIJdRbO1uhxbUT9iJb247SJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e90hMJBXVgXz4OtnzHCLI4vkVlE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.915,"height":2137,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/l6n3cHboh7Qj3eU1SZV3JrefJTa.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":6230}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":896,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a097YNBiTFR9eryZPylZ2INwExz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":166673,"name":"chinese communism"},{"id":218124,"name":"chinese military"},{"id":250076,"name":"social democracy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
