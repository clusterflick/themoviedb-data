This project is to be told through three couples: young, adult and old. We do not know if the project is for a play, a film, a novel or an opera. The author of the project is always accompanied by a kind of servant. Meanwhile, two years earlier, an American civil servant meets with an elderly French couple who had fought in the Resistance during World War II, brokering a deal with a Hollywood director to buy the rights to tell their story. The members of the old couple's family discuss heatedly questions of nation, memory and history.","popularity":0.8448,"poster_path":"/wRD8EpsT4lXjMd4EsL9LMisfKMV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avventura
