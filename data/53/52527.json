Upping the ante from last year’s LA LA LAND, this is a movie not to be missed as the platform has been raised with scenes of riding the historical streets of Quebec city, snowmobiling the vast glaciers of British Columbia, lapping many of the major parks in the USA and reflecting upon what one’s mind would conceive as their own snowboarding lifestyle. With new tricks in the bag, stakes are high for this movie to be destined to open your eyes towards female snowboarding.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See What I See","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
