Now the team will be dissolved if it can't win the rest of the games in the local league. Team member Kent goes on a business trip to Liverpool and meet Duncan Miller, the premier league football star of the 1980s who promises to come over to Sweden and play a few games just for fun. Unfortunately, when he arrives it is obvious that their saviour is both an alcoholic and very unfit to play.
