Their film idea, titled \"The Dawn\", concerns a Mafia don who goes for a hernia operation but gets a sex change instead. During the 1996 Toronto Fest, they approach Roger Ebert, Norman Jewison (at a packed press conference), Eric Stoltz (leaving a limo), Al Pacino, and others without much success. On a roll, they leave Toronto for Hollywood, getting advice from Arthur Hiller and Neil Simon and finding an agent who expresses interest in their pitch.","popularity":1.9463,"poster_path":"/pwL7faAN2Rei2gOZvGejNqcDhIi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hotz-Rice Productions Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":95032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinefornia","origin_country":""},{"id":95033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hollywood or Bust Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pitch","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Hotz","original_name":"Kenny Hotz","popularity":0.2885,"profile_path":"/5mIj0eVQS6Nj9TulX1p8VD6qP9W.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54bed4b69251416e9b00749d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Rice","original_name":"Spencer Rice","popularity":0.2059,"profile_path":"/bNX0c54clnPjkSqGHEcPTNiKghK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4847c3a36847f815f6b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samuel Z.
