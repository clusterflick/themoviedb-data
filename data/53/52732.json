The 80's live on for these enthusiasts, who compete against each other and history to record the world's highest scores. Portland gamer Bill Carlton is one of the most brazen, fearlessly taking on some of the toughest records on the books. HIGH SCORE follows Bill as he attempts to take down the Atari classic Missile Command and its twenty year-old record. To get the 80 million points he'll have to play the game on one quarter for over two days straight. There is no pause button. There will be no sleep. There can only be one victor in this classic story of Man versus Missile Command.","popularity":0.4815,"poster_path":"/jG5YwZpqWABlEyuKiQLaJybtCrj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116230,"logo_path":null,"name":"MackAttack!
