The campaign is unique in the world in its strategic structure and extensive scope.  All the problems we see today with a growing distrust of the political and democratic system, and scientific facts, can therefore be seen as a predictable consequence of this campaign and paradigm shift. It also gives us an idea of the background to when politics began to become meaningless, and more about creating mock debates and rhetorical plays in the media where, for example, scientific facts are no longer an obvious starting point.  The Swedish Troll Factory makes visible the strategies and power interests behind this unique disinformation campaign and how it manipulates the democratic system.","popularity":0.6679,"poster_path":"/z37ZkZ3SVyays1jxH4Z5MuNYIyC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Swedish Troll Factory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathalie Gabrielsson","original_name":"Nathalie Gabrielsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664c9dab7afcc88c91198d16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sköld","original_name":"Peter Sköld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664c9db560a1ba0c1954ab14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z37ZkZ3SVyays1jxH4Z5MuNYIyC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":18257,"name":"educational"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nathalie Gabrielsson, Peter Sköld: The Swedish Troll Factory (2022, 2:04 min, excerpt).","key":"867144722","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-22T12:10:02.000Z","id":"664c9ecaba5caef85d198cb7"}]}}}
