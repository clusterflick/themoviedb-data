However, his life takes a dark turn when he receives a mysterious text: 'I need you to do something or someone close to you will die.' Dismissing it as a prank, Miles ignores the message. But when more threats follow, and his loved ones become victim of mysterious crimes, Miles is thrust into a race against time to uncover the truth. Could it be a resentful former colleague seeking revenge for a job loss, or perhaps a disgruntled neighbor seeking retribution for financial losses? Miles must untangle a web of deception before it's too late.","popularity":0.2679,"poster_path":"/dgNJxm6Q8z1DfQpSkkiB3REMa5E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Stream Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Your Past Becomes Your Fate","title":"Fated","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4725475,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yohance Brinson","original_name":"Yohance Brinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664b93ac0d66df01ca934156","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4725475,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yohance Brinson","original_name":"Yohance Brinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664b93b71c6a336bf2ed4a90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29353645","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jH29C6DhQaQ1jwxPCL66Bh6IhCI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dgNJxm6Q8z1DfQpSkkiB3REMa5E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
