Some footage is consensual, some is “stolen.” This way my personal-intimate becomes narrative: the recent separation, the pain of my children’s being apart, my parents’ separation, my inadequacy as a mother. But in this autobiographical process of “coming out” I inevitably clash with the privacy of those close to me. The result is a kind of intimate diary that, in becoming public, is perhaps shameless and obscene. But where are the boundaries between what should remain private, offstage, and what can be made public and shared?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chutzpah – Something About Modesty and Shame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Lisa Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Lisa Stambrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Key Cast","credit_id":"664d18b064d1b74b69615103","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Lisa Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Lisa Stambrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664d1874781a6a5f8a186593","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728050,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valerio Antonini","original_name":"Valerio Antonini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664d18816733cf2a83fce95c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728051,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pietro Torcolini","original_name":"Pietro Torcolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664d188cd04f16d9ac347311","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raffaella Milazzo","original_name":"Raffaella Milazzo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664d1896cfdf77a0ae90ac3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728053,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Olexa","original_name":"Mark Olexa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664d18a01e57059561ca8184","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
