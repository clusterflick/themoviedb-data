This sweetly evocative personal piece pairs nostalgic-feeling film footage of toys, wobbly cradle Balance Balls, and light and shadow, with Hua’s poetic reflections presented as hand-drawn text on screen. Hua shot the 16mm footage intuitively (not to or for a script), wrote the text separately, then put them together in post-production creating an evocative capaciousness further enchanted by an airy score. “When I was little, time was slow and I thought I could catch time,” Hua tells us, ”Now, I made a wish.” Embedded in that wish is gentle reckoning and liberation through which she offers a soothing, cinematic, beguiling respite.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"Time is a loop\", I wish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yue Hua","original_name":"Yue Hua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cbb49ac111d8b687d2875","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Good Symptom","release_date":"2024-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
