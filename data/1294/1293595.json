A retrospective that runs the gamut of the cast and crew's experiences on the film. We get a look at some storyboards, hear about weirding out the MPAA, and see star and amateur shutterbug Rufus Sewell present the many photos he took on the set.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of Shell Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
