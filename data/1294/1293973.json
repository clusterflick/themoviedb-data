CONTROL. TERROR. The centre points of any dictatorship. The need for power, the want for tyrannical control and the subsequent terror unleashed to achieve their goals make dictators some of the most fascinating figures to study in history. In this series we will be looking at some of the 20th century's most notorious dictators, from their rise to power to their inevitable downfall. In this episode we look at the man responsible for Italy's expansionist concept, the founder of fascism, Il Duce; Benito Mussolini. From his humble upbringing born to a blacksmith and a school teacher, to becoming the most powerful man in Italy, Mussolini's life was tarred with violence and terror. Responsible for the death of up to 1 million people and the suffering of countless others, Mussolini is one of the most brutal dictators the world has ever seen.","popularity":0.3133,"poster_path":"/c8LAJ1pjDNKcsTjJ18xecyYnzVO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertain Me Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dictators: Mussolini","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3528446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Pine","original_name":"Lisa Pine","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664de8062305d297599b968b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Walters","original_name":"Guy Walters","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/fUxQ9OWfvtFFCEvIE6vo0Xsxmci.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664de80ce9b4172c3413f9de","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3714178,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Sempey","original_name":"Ben Sempey","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678edae1afcb32c499436fff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27051313","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Ax5kHIHjK8z0HInESTvtbv20xm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8LAJ1pjDNKcsTjJ18xecyYnzVO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
