The organic shapes resembling indigenous figuration of sea creatures, the intersecting vertical lines, the animation of forms which appear to interact and the moments of striking three dimensionality all recall Lye’s Tusalava (1929), Free Radicals (1958) and Color Box (1935). De Bruyn’s film seems somewhat free-form at first but in ways that also nod to Lye’s work, a structure of developing sections and a layered repetition of shapes in a loose fugal pattern becomes clearer as the film progresses. -Steven McIntyre","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bIksEukj1f0tKCssRP6uQhLsgQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Migraine Particles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dirk de Bruyn","original_name":"Dirk de Bruyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bnvs5MAoCf29KzNdw2RRWSKSXz8.jpg","credit_id":"664d3632f57c23a36105f094","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bIksEukj1f0tKCssRP6uQhLsgQH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
