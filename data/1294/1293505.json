To pay back the money owed, Peter proposes that Ana and Gringo visit his father with him. They accept his proposal, thinking they might trick some money out of the old mountaineer with a story about Ana's upcoming marriage to Peter (with Gringo as the best man). During the long and colorful journey the three become friends and complicit in the deception. Peter's father, though, instantly recognizes the scam and steals the bride from his incompetent son. Gringo is happy with this turn of events but Peter is irritated by it. However, the father's sudden death before the registrar prevents Ana and Gringo from inheriting. When the dreams of material wealth vanish, what is left is the love between Ana and Peter, and the friendship that struck up between the three, so much so that at the end Gringo sacrifices himself for the couple's happiness.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/rgg8sWWLbAMexSK2RU10cpKhnJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dimitar Anakiev Films","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":109096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petra Pan Film Production","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":83642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luksuz DZMP","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Normal Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iva Babič","original_name":"Iva Babič","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"664cc3c05e39a926b0967f60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irfan Beširević","original_name":"Irfan Beširević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Natakar","credit_id":"664cc3d3deccb28cc47d330c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Dragosavljević-Rutar","original_name":"Walter Dragosavljević-Rutar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gringo","credit_id":"664cc3ddfcab3b5b5179baea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Primož Ekart","original_name":"Primož Ekart","popularity":0.0796,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"664cc3e65dfe0342de259cf5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Harbers","original_name":"Harrison Harbers","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Varuh","credit_id":"664cc3f3855bea90f21e1dbc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Petan","original_name":"Petra Petan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Petra Petan","credit_id":"664cc41982e0c77226302a2b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vahdeta Dragosavljević-Rutar","original_name":"Vahdeta Dragosavljević-Rutar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Pevka","credit_id":"664cc42dcf9b5a72eeeb91db","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Simčič","original_name":"Marko Simčič","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Lojz","credit_id":"664cc436fe7ce32414777660","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandar Todorović","original_name":"Aleksandar Todorović","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Aleksandar Todorović","credit_id":"664cc44c0aea46d541777590","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goran Perc","original_name":"Goran Perc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Varuh (voice)","credit_id":"664cc3fdd65054c897967f11","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitar Anakiev","original_name":"Dimitar Anakiev","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/5tgrNpTBCX8b9YH5u34P4Mhjjdc.jpg","credit_id":"664cc38fee8cab60d7799187","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitar Anakiev","original_name":"Dimitar Anakiev","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/5tgrNpTBCX8b9YH5u34P4Mhjjdc.jpg","credit_id":"664cc395a82345f8e0ed8c0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2377688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rgg8sWWLbAMexSK2RU10cpKhnJv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
