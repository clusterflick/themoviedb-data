Recently, this historic footage has been colorized and digitized by a team of international experts. You can watch the remastered footage of the last-known surviving Tasmanian tiger here. The thylacine, which resembled a medium-to-large-sized canid, had dark transverse stripes radiating from the top of its back. Sadly, the last known thylacine died in 1936 at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania.","popularity":0.2472,"poster_path":"/krSjkhGdobQVOEB4Q9cCZzIZQ2B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Last & Only Footage of Thylacine","title":"Thylacine Film","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4727397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Fleay","original_name":"David Fleay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/v1zbg5TVgtRpXur6DltXUfyTPhj.jpg","credit_id":"664ccf4bb31a85b3b566a54f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krSjkhGdobQVOEB4Q9cCZzIZQ2B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190114,"name":"tasmanian tiger"},{"id":241981,"name":"thylacine"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hobart Zoo","release_date":"1933-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tasmanian Tiger in Colour","key":"6gt0X-27GXM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-07T03:48:15.000Z","id":"664cd019b70f990006f2e2ff"}]}}}
