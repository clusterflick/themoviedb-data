It dives deep into the weird, wild archives of medical imaging, public health messaging, and pop-culture outbreak narratives to understand how ideas have moved between science, science fiction, and political ideology over the past century. (Yes, this is a film that covers both antibiotic resistance and the persistence of zombie apocalypse films.) Ultimately, DIS-EASE is a provocation to re-think how we define both the \"public\" and \"health\" in public health - who is included, what counts as care, and what it means to be sick or well in a world perpetually on the brink of collapse.","popularity":0.1662,"poster_path":"/pR6pnX3cb7G5M1mm9pbT90rB5Io.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dis-Ease","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priscilla Wald","original_name":"Priscilla Wald","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c506bfd41d53caff2da4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Landecker","original_name":"Hannah Landecker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c507986e45191358a0717","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiji Fukuda","original_name":"Keiji Fukuda","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c508ca140894fa1ed8cdf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Shah","original_name":"Sonia Shah","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c50a85e9d619dca8a0a7d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Tomes","original_name":"Nancy Tomes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c50b57509698a011e0d63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Hedva","original_name":"Johanna Hedva","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c50c3a0f7144e44930b90","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sridhar Venkatapuram","original_name":"Sridhar Venkatapuram","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c50ce855bea90f21e1885","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Vargha","original_name":"Dora Vargha","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c50dd5dfe0342de25985f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nayan Shah","original_name":"Nayan Shah","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664c50ea88821f7e16303057","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia J.
