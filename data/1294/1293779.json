Endowed with a singular gift: glimpsing the past and future as an eternal present, Hebe defies temporal convention, questioning whether her premonitions are pre-written destinies or mere whispers of chance. Inspired by true events, Hebe invites us into the fabric of time to discover whether her gift can and should be controlled or whether she should surrender and succumb to it.","popularity":0.4118,"poster_path":"/3ZhfcmhniwlD1yUMiTwEfUr4gkC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baserri
