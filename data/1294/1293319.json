The effects can be devastanting, a life can be completely riuned.  Even that of a success man, even that of a surgeon who is trating small bodies affected by the most terrible ills. This is a tragedy that is born from suspicion. Sergio is suspected of being a brutal seriel killer, someone who has been killing for years in a rich provincial city. A tragedy, a black hole that suddendly sucks down all our certains, one by one.  This is the worst nightmare that could possibly happen to anyone of us. And infact it happens to Sergio. Voices and insinuations are more dangerous than a sentence. Suspicion spreads more quickly than the penal code and it will ruin a man's reputation. With no appeal allowed.","popularity":0.278,"poster_path":"/1uUlM5M3AqP7YDA16INwfeInNI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56649,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albatross Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":154744,"logo_path":"/qYIEHRctL3YFth36F1LwhEQvOl5.png","name":"Rai Fiction","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Terza Verità","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":282701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bianca Guaccero","original_name":"Bianca Guaccero","popularity":0.3806,"profile_path":"/m4pATiQGsv5OQ0d7Z4yQxir7n0a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lidia Roccella","credit_id":"664c5c6241e21d9ce5f74a15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Kanakis","original_name":"Anna Kanakis","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/1npOmhXukx81fPUEYFj6o6iNjno.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Claudia Lepore","credit_id":"664c5cad199d8c6f2d54a494","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo De Caro","original_name":"Enzo De Caro","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":"/aDaNdQCS3R9dcjiwUZ3FsDakCHz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sergio Giansanti","credit_id":"664c5cbe39a681446b79875e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Falaguasta","original_name":"Marco Falaguasta","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/aiz15nZNuVXHbJpoLSjC95pQt0j.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Guido Salimbeni","credit_id":"664c5d129cae26b47ef74ca2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flavia Astolfi","original_name":"Flavia Astolfi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Luisa","credit_id":"664c5d21dd770afc84f742ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosimo Cinieri","original_name":"Cosimo Cinieri","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/msFwcA6QCDDRgMzQZcAWNWSsVIE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Carlo Roccella","credit_id":"664c5d375fdc60704e2599d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leandro Amato","original_name":"Leandro Amato","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/bfBhH7VB2JGcoar8CidEEOaH0TT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lucio Vieri","credit_id":"664c5d55390fd82acbf74c59","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1862841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovica Gargari","original_name":"Ludovica Gargari","popularity":0.0812,"profile_path":"/jQl6HZOtqj2Duz6rWQKe9sQYI6d.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Carlotta Giansanti","credit_id":"664c5d82a82345f8e0ed863e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":993854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benedetta Gargari","original_name":"Benedetta Gargari","popularity":0.2498,"profile_path":"/bl11awjwiIVO2zblTE01twqDK1z.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Michela Giansanti","credit_id":"664c5d9a3a5676fb707d1f9b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650288,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salvatore Basile","original_name":"Salvatore Basile","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/yYT2SSYf8Cjgu4sJfKtAwbrd3zg.jpg","credit_id":"664c5dc4390fd82acbf74c64","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783810,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Balletta","original_name":"Francesco Balletta","popularity":0.0572,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664c5dd27afcc88c911989b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Reali","original_name":"Stefano Reali","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/o7RcJClerEfUKqgYEixQhQmSBYm.jpg","credit_id":"664c5dae8cd8de4dba1e1b55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1034426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1uUlM5M3AqP7YDA16INwfeInNI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
