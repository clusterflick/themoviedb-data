Washi tape is a recent invention, created in the mid-2000s, and is known for its variety of colourful decorative designs, ease of use and having a sticky quality that leaves no residue. Inspired by the pattern films of Jodie Mack and Scott Fitzpatrick, this film layers numbers, cartoon cats and geometric shapes, and text. Artist Abby Brock created animated titles and an original flute soundtrack to accompany the film. The audio mirrors the layering and patterns of the washi tape through a stacked, non-melodic woodwind sound, while the fast-paced animation follows the abruptness of the visuals. \"Tape-stry\" is a playful manipulation of rice paper tape: rip, cut, paste, repeat.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AvJJga0Nz910TPV0CdmOYqZUmMC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tape-stry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rennie Taylor","original_name":"Rennie Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yXikmMWkEYHx1ataUIyvX2KJ9Kf.jpg","credit_id":"664cbde3abe7563b1593093d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4876087,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abby Brock","original_name":"Abby Brock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b6344fd3593a82dc270698","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AvJJga0Nz910TPV0CdmOYqZUmMC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opY2cg7noaqkJqGvRbwuV82gBpw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6bDOaAPgQYhZSB7e8qhzuRTn6Ib.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3LDBaMPNq2hWStcZeTuGhc8CDRA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tape-stry (2023)","key":"878670822","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-27T13:03:24.000Z","id":"66b6348b90426a8b55a76375"}]}}}
