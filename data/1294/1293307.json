Now an elder, Fa'aye is caught between the trappings of the present day and trying to maintain a meaningful connection to his traditional territory, which has now been privatized by the state. With his young grandson in tow, Fa'aye is determined to return to the forest and reassert his duty to care for the bamboo despite the serious legal ramifications of his actions. The Crying Bamboo Forest is a remarkable first feature film that reflects the struggles and challenges currently faced by many Indigenous people living in Taiwan.","popularity":0.0878,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crying Bamboo Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Banay Yukeh","original_name":"Banay Yukeh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Old man","credit_id":"664c524e390fd82acbf74bee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1402818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yi-Fan Hsu","original_name":"Yi-Fan Hsu","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/k68UfTiHBDjQSaUqdl8OAOQbGil.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Son","credit_id":"664c525e855bea90f21e18ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaw Behuy","original_name":"Isaw Behuy","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fa'aye","credit_id":"664c53c19501519c9d1e10ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2244312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaki Baunky","original_name":"Gaki Baunky","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Atayal father","credit_id":"664c527b9501519c9d1e1098","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laka Umaw","original_name":"Laka Umaw","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/2o9xX8E8TpdOtISH1HGC9t91QAl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cleaner","credit_id":"664c5292ac111d8b687d2310","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umin Boya","original_name":"馬志翔","popularity":0.3136,"profile_path":"/lwwXChc5zdXaMK6Ve8rcj5B8dcO.jpg","credit_id":"664c5167b31a85b3b5669f81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3767894,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Baobu Badulu","original_name":"Baobu Badulu","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664c5416199d8c6f2d54a453","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7870932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan Indigenous TV","release_date":"2010-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
