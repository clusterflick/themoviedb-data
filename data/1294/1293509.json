While the drama of the European invasion and occupation of the American continent was justified as being the “destiny” of white people, there have always been alternative ways of living on the land, practiced by people who have been pushed to the economic margins.  A collage of poetic imagery, music, and abstracted, incantatory language, the film follows two men in an excavation of our cultural soil, using improvised dialog. Their words gives rise to unexpected landscapes, populated by bats, conquistadors, and flying fiddles. A postmodern video opera, Marginal Understandings bathes the viewer in music, language, and visual spectacle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dAnepXEWyI35bzMD9SFN4HIweYh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marginal Understandings (Dirt: Part Two)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cc516a3be1716d3777606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dAnepXEWyI35bzMD9SFN4HIweYh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
