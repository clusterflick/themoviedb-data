The film holds feelings of unrest, negativity, love and loss. Like a lament, it carries the song of the off-season, rutting, wind and rain - cradled discordantly and arranged in pieces. In duet with their family recordings, similar sights and subjects are found.  A line in the film is written to the audience as well as pictured in negative afterimage - ‘Our mother points to houses that receive no mail.’  An Illusion is offered to the audience. Which images stay with us?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cyhUL0wQ4lZq9CaFFNt9VkdbCNE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Off-Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jen Martin","original_name":"Jen Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cafbba0e322e081777512","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cyhUL0wQ4lZq9CaFFNt9VkdbCNE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
