Some of them were fiction films. Others consist of documentary images of my friends, of the city where I lived, in the suburb of Paris, and of my holidays, avoiding almost totally to film my family. I edited these films to tell that part of my life, where I went from adolescence to adulthood.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yYGh6I2IHmCyranqsvAVECgQ3Lf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No way back to Parly 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Plasseraud","original_name":"Emmanuel Plasseraud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cc95efe7ce324147776c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYGh6I2IHmCyranqsvAVECgQ3Lf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
