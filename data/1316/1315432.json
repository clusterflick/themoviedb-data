Preston alternates brief scripted scenes of songs and thoughts, fictionalized encounters and news items with the street footage, much of which was shot from his own window overlooking Avenue of the Americas at 24th St. His own cast of characters intermingles with the characters on the street for a full view of the city's life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open 7 Days a Week, 24 Hours a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Creston","original_name":"Bill Creston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668f19674acb245aba41fa9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
