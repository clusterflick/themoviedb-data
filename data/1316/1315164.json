Robin decides to single-handedly look into these Slovenian beliefs. Puhar claims that for the light-sensitive matter he used mercury, sulfur, iodine and possibly varnish, which he applied in the end to protect the emulsion. But his real formula has never been brought to light anywhere. Indeed, the whole world knows that no one has used Puhar's ingredients to make photographs, because the said three elements are not sensitive to light - neither separately nor together as a compound. Robin therefore arrives at the key question: are the four Puhar originals, which currently exist around the world, real or are they just a mistake made by Slovenian historians and museum specialists?","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/2SxTvR8iFxb1BCYfdgCIKjVZ5Sd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casablanca Film Production (SI)","origin_country":""},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janez Puhar's Missing Formula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Srečko Meh","original_name":"Srečko Meh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"668e808962c5f3902cb30ca8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Crichton","original_name":"Robin Crichton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - The Host","credit_id":"668e80bc082ee9ff3e9eddf3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janez Lombergar","original_name":"Janez Lombergar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668e807f0b03cc2cf3539c4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drago Medved","original_name":"Drago Medved","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668e80cb5b43257da6539c31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Prus","original_name":"Helena Prus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"668e80d150d398efe4539c38","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janko Bračika","original_name":"Janko Bračika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668e810a10d1adeb52424dcc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Gašperič","original_name":"Ivan Gašperič","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668e8115baea718612d5b1c6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matjaž Virant","original_name":"Matjaž Virant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668e8120942e4a4f834250b9","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Gržinčič","original_name":"Pavel Gržinčič","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668e8074a763e0e6429ed5db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4123084,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Povh","original_name":"Peter Povh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668e8068082ee9ff3e9eddef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9728382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2SxTvR8iFxb1BCYfdgCIKjVZ5Sd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
