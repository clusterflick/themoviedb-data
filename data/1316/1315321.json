They're in debt and a slimy, vape-sucking 'Mr Green' threatens to buy the place and chop it up into holiday cottages for the tourists. Bonny overcomes her lack of self confidence and, with the help of the colourful chippy ladies and some smelly wet batter mix, rejuvenates the chip shop to it's original beating heart of this once bustling, sea-side community. Bonny Chip is told entirely through an original garage/folk musical score.","popularity":0.182,"poster_path":"/wLLPA1fwffo5rCv1nweeYW1REsp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonny Chip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rishi Nair","original_name":"Rishi Nair","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mr Green","credit_id":"668ed08c250fb13e1d15e74c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lesley Saint-John","original_name":"Lesley Saint-John","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Brenda","credit_id":"668ed0c42adae92e4303356b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1213470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Stanley","original_name":"Allison Stanley","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Peggy","credit_id":"668ed0d020e190646cdcdd07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Jameson","original_name":"Deborah Jameson","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eileen","credit_id":"668ed0de250fb13e1d15e760","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosie Fox","original_name":"Rosie Fox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bonny","credit_id":"668ed0ef96302bd468281968","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Bretherton","original_name":"Edward Bretherton","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gaz the Lad","credit_id":"668ed0fb00a9ad85c9b85ab7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haley Muraleedharan","original_name":"Haley Muraleedharan","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ed115fd05c7e1b88fa905","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3093628,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugh Mann Adamson","original_name":"Hugh Mann Adamson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ed13ae84061dc2815e733","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosie Fox","original_name":"Rosie Fox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ed1242658161ef515e73b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosie Fox","original_name":"Rosie Fox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ed12c322f4887d639c68a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Fernández-Gil","original_name":"Gabriel Fernández-Gil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ed146db2d3bb3ee39c667","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haley Muraleedharan","original_name":"Haley Muraleedharan","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ed10dbbc7650b35b85ae7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22076822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BonnyChip","instagram_id":"xfoxcox","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/18IMn72RoVvDr0r8BDiTaJ4xPal.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wLLPA1fwffo5rCv1nweeYW1REsp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
