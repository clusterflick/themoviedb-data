Although she has been married for more than ten years, she still has a lot of control over her husband's every move. One day, Qiu Ying saw her husband chatting with a dancer and became so jealous that she argued with her husband and then killed him by mistake. She was about to run away, but she entered a park by mistake, and was so frightened by the murals of the Ten Emperor's Palace and the Nine Hells that she ran home. After returning home, Qiu Ying feels more and more uneasy and has to take sleeping pills to get some sleep.
