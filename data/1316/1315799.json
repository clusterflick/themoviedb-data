The program includes beautifully-photographed scenes take during the legendary Railfan Weekend in October 1991, when 2-4-4T 7 was correctly lettered for the Bridgton & Harrison Railroad for the first time in 50 years! The little engine pulled a special photo freight through spectacular fall colors. Coverage of the final 1991 Holiday Spectacular at Edaville is then shows, followed by the equipment move to Portland and the 1997 Edaville Cranberry Festival, complete with superb helicopter views of the little trains in action. A tour of the Portland museum featuring trackside, onboard, and in-cab views, along with some unusual night video sequences and a colorful fireworks display, completes the program.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4qbwSIn8GvPBo5M2ovGU517nrUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233636,"logo_path":"/uNlXGcdlkg5UBidJOVoy6dE0See.png","name":"Mark I Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edaville Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4824705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Boyd","original_name":"Jim Boyd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfnphxnJ1chtBALbY4VENDm1fzp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66904983b358086594069e4e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824702,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc S.
