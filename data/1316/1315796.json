Through extremely rare archive film footage, you'll learn the history of the Maine two-footers and observe regular-service trains on the Sandy River and Bridgeton & Harrison Railroads. Passenger and freight activities, and even winter scenes, are included. The program then describes the evolution of Edaville, from its planning and construction as a cranberry-hauling freight line to a full-fledged theme park. You'll ride the train and view the railroad from both onboard and trackside perspectives, and see coverage of special railfan events, including night activities.","popularity":0.2355,"poster_path":"/4qbwSIn8GvPBo5M2ovGU517nrUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233636,"logo_path":"/uNlXGcdlkg5UBidJOVoy6dE0See.png","name":"Mark I Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Massachusetts' Maine Attraction: The Edaville Railroad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4824705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Boyd","original_name":"Jim Boyd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfnphxnJ1chtBALbY4VENDm1fzp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"669045f8bbda0e2440807e44","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4824705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Boyd","original_name":"Jim Boyd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfnphxnJ1chtBALbY4VENDm1fzp.jpg","credit_id":"6690435a59ff393dadecb36d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824702,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc S.
