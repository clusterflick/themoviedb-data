With the introduction of Bonno Eversong, a pacifist bard, skepticism hung heavy in the air. Bonno's arrival stirred doubt among the group; however, with time, his soothing melodies and quick wit began to sway their opinions. As the game progressed, the misfit band faced daunting challenges, including a menacing troll guarding a bridge and a fearsome fire-breathing dragon. Through determination, unexpected ingenuity, and Bonno's unwavering commitment to peace, they not only conquered the trials but discovered a renewed sense of unity, illustrating that strength can manifest in unconventional ways.","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":233628,"logo_path":null,"name":"3-Banana Budget Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a realm of fire-breathing fury and hungry giants, one bard's melody will be mightier than the sword.","title":"Bonno Eversong and the 20 Sides of Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Podwysocki","original_name":"Oliver Podwysocki","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bonno Eversong","credit_id":"6690224cc919e1cb8dee2d6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Blake","original_name":"Don Blake","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bifur the Bald","credit_id":"66902264c80f66ba19802fd9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Campbell","original_name":"Jessica Campbell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Enchantress of the Woods","credit_id":"6690227ba8e53f1ac89e0b00","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Schoenhals","original_name":"Mike Schoenhals","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66902292665b97a9d5891ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Schoenhals","original_name":"Mike Schoenhals","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66902298a81c569c35d55eb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carson Ho","original_name":"Carson Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669022a8f8a53e3b1651f92d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Corey Smith","original_name":"Corey Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669022c028cfb1b04d069da0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824537,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bill Kingsland","original_name":"Bill Kingsland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669022cd60ff82ddd6807d8c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522136,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brent Phillips-Watts","original_name":"Brent Phillips-Watts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669022ebad0f1681f09e0b05","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522136,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brent Phillips-Watts","original_name":"Brent Phillips-Watts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669022f159ff393dadecb2d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
