While waiting for the train, he meets a man who is waiting for his son. They both see in each other a strange familiarity that allows them to open their souls and imitate real life, to try to heal their wounds by saying things they should have said a long time ago, but perhaps never will. Guilt, resentment and love haunt their thoughts, even when they thought they had already overcome them.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/1F1bTbVR4EfiGn69z0wAaCilcYz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2023-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father's day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Nuñez","original_name":"Marcelo Nuñez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"668eacd93baebeeedd9ed7f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3577825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Olórtegui","original_name":"Pedro Olórtegui","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"668eace360a3a185d1699cfe","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Nuñez","original_name":"Marcelo Nuñez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668eacf8baea718612d5b3a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Nuñez","original_name":"Marcelo Nuñez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ead013baebeeedd9ed7fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Nuñez","original_name":"Marcelo Nuñez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ead0a275c062a93d5b272","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822550,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guillermo Morales","original_name":"Guillermo Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ead1ae6ef3bc178bc848f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlu4t0Tq7DuYMCfHovfrOpFkhZz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1F1bTbVR4EfiGn69z0wAaCilcYz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mumbai Shorts International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
