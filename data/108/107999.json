Unfortunately, Greg, who is Uncle Bump, tends to drink too much and has not started his next book. Martha won a contest to illustrate the book and the first thing that happens is that Greg gets her soused. To keep her there to illustrate, John gets a juvenile delinquent named Danny to play his son and show how much pressure he is under. The ploy works at first, but Greg's heart was broken by Tillie, and Martha may be the girl who makes him forget all about her.","popularity":2.2634,"poster_path":"/rEho1kEDXUh9CwmuqjdAGdZh2oW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"M-G-M's Picture of Happy-go-lucky Love!","title":"The Bride Goes Wild","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Van Johnson","original_name":"Van Johnson","popularity":0.5195,"profile_path":"/A6vw5kbdmyXDz1ddQOocJmg9TSc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Greg Rawlings","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4bcd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Allyson","original_name":"June Allyson","popularity":0.5622,"profile_path":"/5kVGMneSYFWdxslO7cYA7li7N2U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martha Terryton","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4bd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hume Cronyn","original_name":"Hume Cronyn","popularity":0.6138,"profile_path":"/dM7Yfswa4Hi6TU9jvMFrT9RbEDx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John McGrath","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4bd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins","original_name":"Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/oUDGBNsaYcIWF3VGOgnX7FQEUK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Danny","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4bd9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Una Merkel","original_name":"Una Merkel","popularity":0.2995,"profile_path":"/u4oNB36e1Cjsh3CDwUFA6UAiYf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Doberly","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4bdd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlene Dahl","original_name":"Arlene Dahl","popularity":0.9468,"profile_path":"/p2SPLoSVfvNUayyLRJ7twyQMp5R.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tillie Smith Oliver","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4be1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Corrigan","original_name":"Lloyd Corrigan","popularity":0.2651,"profile_path":"/vlcMdcXRbho8Zgm13dSeO9iDRQW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"'Pops'","credit_id":"52fe4a8dc3a36847f81d4be9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Derr","original_name":"Richard Derr","popularity":0.2678,"profile_path":"/29gSKDPvS3EC69kwAvrSGTPmUa6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bruce Kope Johnson","credit_id":"56f15580c3a368718e0030b7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Risdon","original_name":"Elisabeth Risdon","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/h4n8KEk4IYwugDiEt0MAqX3id53.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"rs.
