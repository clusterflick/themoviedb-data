Soon, he begins to sell airtime to the various locals, who broadcast their own personal love dedications and (more frequently) insults for all to hear. A subplot evolves between Abelardo (the stranger), Celeste (a young woman who is chained inside her father's house to stop her running away), and José (a young man).","popularity":0.6754,"poster_path":"/pDrflEA0HGDWlBTWZvAWqp79wL1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pegaso
