He hears the rumor that she'd have an affair with her trustee - so he kills him in a set-up duel and aims to take his place. Against her initial resistance, Monza manages to win her heart - and to get into her bed. This doesn't stay a secret for long, but Monza, now in love, does everything to keep it going.","popularity":0.4336,"poster_path":"/oRTK55RAAcAmKSu15OQ678eFgSz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4420,"logo_path":"/pXxqTCJMn9dgFUsANd2eCZxRDEa.png","name":"Clemi
