This becomes more complicated when a beautiful visiting teacher moves into the Gare home and she becomes involved in a battle of wills. To complicate matters more, a deep secret held by Caleb's wife will have to come to the surface. With the family at the breaking point, they must put aside their differences to bring in the year's harvest, after which they celebrate at the town's annual festival.
