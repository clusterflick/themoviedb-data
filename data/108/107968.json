The gig – broadcast live on BBC Two – featured new material such as 'Violet Hill' and '42', alongside old favorites including 'Clocks', 'Fix You' and 'In My Place'. The band left the main stage briefly to perform an acoustic version of 'Yellow' against the backdrop of the Television Centre building.
