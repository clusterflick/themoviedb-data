Directed by Charles Kiselyak, the film goes behind the scenes with Stone on the production of Born on the Fourth of July and other films, through production stills, interviews, and comments from the director himself. Also included with the career retrospective is Stone's first short film, 1971's Last Year in Viet Nam.","popularity":0.3168,"poster_path":"/AlGPPN6t69QHLgkhQSy4sYrZ9vd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oliver Stone's America : a dialogue with Oliver Stone","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Stone","original_name":"Oliver Stone","popularity":1.2011,"profile_path":"/nPFtjueZHmU56boVKXEvAoQOTWf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60949ebde039f1003d1f3e79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Kiselyak","original_name":"Charles Kiselyak","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60949ecbe2bca8003d1893a6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Kiselyak","original_name":"Charles Kiselyak","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a76c3a36847f81cf5e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0359769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1375,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AlGPPN6t69QHLgkhQSy4sYrZ9vd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":926}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
