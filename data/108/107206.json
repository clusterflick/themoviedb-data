Set in the indie rock utopia of an evergreen forested Olympia Washington of the early 90's, this film chronicles the journey of the love of three friends from childhood to adulthood over a span of 20 years. Nestled in the mythology of bands such as Beat Happening, Bikini Kill, Unwound, and the Melvins, the story of KARP is the story of a childhood love forced to make adult changes in order to survive an adult world and how the choices we face as we follow our dreams affect those whom we love most. It is the story of how so often the thing that frees you can become your largest obstacle.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":"/oyQYArDN18oGtMaNCWil7OhJVIt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary About a Band Called KARP","title":"Kill All Redneck Pricks: A Documentary Film about a Band Called KARP","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5119781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Smith","original_name":"Chris Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0ebc5d7034db5a49104e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5119778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Jernigan","original_name":"Scott Jernigan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0ea896cfddbf19cc9ea1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5119784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Warren","original_name":"Jared Warren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0eef96cfddbf19cc9ee2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Johnson","original_name":"Calvin Johnson","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e12b4f74c3a1388b9f4fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":52455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kimya Dawson","original_name":"Kimya Dawson","popularity":0.1184,"profile_path":"/hPFZewHloTKK9gbGTQM5uEqtZJD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0f0f96cfddbf19cc9eed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Hanna","original_name":"Kathleen Hanna","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/cRxHQsSheKsDcD4CCTXBGipz3n5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0f3e5bd3c72a82c19105","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buzz Osborne","original_name":"Buzz Osborne","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/o8ZHry9qqF6KsqCrw4F5GFtwVGX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0f305bd3c72a82c190ee","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Crover","original_name":"Dale Crover","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/7rz9vpDw66ij28BtHA4Rybgacln.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675e0f015d7034db5a491068","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William E.
