Filmed over a four year period, REDLIGHT focuses on the personal stories of young Cambodian victims and two remarkable advocates for change: grass-roots activist Somaly Mam and politician Mu Sochua. Using gritty footage smuggled out of brothels and harrowing testimonials, REDLIGHT follows the plight of several current and former child sex slaves. Some are trying to regain entry into Cambodian society to find some semblance of normality after their horrific experiences. Other stories highlight the plight of victims who are attempting to bring the perpetrators to justice. Their torturous yet ultimately heroic battles to find witnesses and take brothel owners to court are dramatically brought to life in this topical and moving feature documentary.","popularity":0.576,"poster_path":"/pgC608Mv5qC9iYmzmmAmwvXobdm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40368,"logo_path":null,"name":"Priority Films","origin_country":""},{"id":40369,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guggenheim Girvin Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":40370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Max Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redlight","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Liu","original_name":"Lucy Liu","popularity":9.4629,"profile_path":"/9nbtjqsx3De7hO2XDtrBQ7M9VCH.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a36847f81d02e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Somaly Mam","original_name":"Somaly Mam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5481344f9251414efa00524e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reena","original_name":"Reena","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5481345fc3a36829a3004fd6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sokha","original_name":"Sokha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5481346ac3a36829b5005f2a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Kiselyak","original_name":"Charles Kiselyak","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a36847f81d02f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adi Ezroni","original_name":"Adi Ezroni","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/qBuVkg0NPJsQa2akGc9DvTTtRRS.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a36847f81d02e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy Jacobson","original_name":"Guy Jacobson","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a36847f81d02ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203457,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Megan Raney Aarons","original_name":"Megan Raney Aarons","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5481349ac3a36817a5004f5d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy Jacobson","original_name":"Guy Jacobson","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5481348dc3a368299f003f3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin K.
