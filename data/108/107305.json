Learning, real understanding, war, poverty, mass media, and what the future has in store for us. These are some of the issues she reflects upon with the experienced help in the form of insights provided by: philosophers (Rafael Argullol), doctors (Sir John Woodhall), writers (Amin Maalouf), musicians (Trilok Gurtu), professors (Ramón Tamames, Federico Mayor Zaragoza), social workers (Bani Dugal, Linda Kavelin-Popov, Gustavo Correa, Alberto Pérez), promoters of new economic systems (Muhammad Yunus, Jean Ziegler). She finally arrives at the conclusion that \"the future, contrary to certain theories, does not write itself. We write the future.\"","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camino al andar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amin Andresco","original_name":"Amin Andresco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Cosmonaut","credit_id":"52fe4a7dc3a36847f81d0d85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Nur Andresco","original_name":"Sarah Nur Andresco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Walker","credit_id":"52fe4a7dc3a36847f81d0d89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Argullol","original_name":"Rafael Argullol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a7dc3a36847f81d0d8d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shole Hejazi","original_name":"Shole Hejazi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a7dc3a36847f81d0d81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0462837","wikidata_id":"Q5742349","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CAMINO AL ANDAR-Sholeh Hejazi-parte 1/9","key":"K2H5L_4gHtM","published_at":"2010-08-12T17:24:24.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e0c3a3685448008647"}]}}}
