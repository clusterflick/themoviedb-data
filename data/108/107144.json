Not Jim and Jamie Dutcher. Raising a pack of gray wolves from puppies, they were able to film their growth, development, and changing behavior. Wolves at Our Door, the sequel to Wolf: Return of a Legend, explores these beautiful animals as they live in America's Northwest. Excellent footage captures the wolves playing with each other and with the Dutchers and allows us a glimpse into another world, one that's not so scary after all. You're sure to see these marvelous beasts differently after watching Wolves at Our Door. --Rob Lightner","popularity":0.3384,"poster_path":"/635v1p3riqsI6HhzCLsvvQYyKvg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolves at Our Door","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kiley","original_name":"Richard Kiley","popularity":0.7628,"profile_path":"/1s24x1TsT8DxBKGksTeeaCmKYvU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"634eef7ea57d43007a2d8b8a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4521249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Dutcher","original_name":"Jim Dutcher","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2138b8e8d30017b78a3c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0326413","wikidata_id":"Q24905536","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tx20XaSVTIMwtKGcK5yeNJ4ghdk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/635v1p3riqsI6HhzCLsvvQYyKvg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
