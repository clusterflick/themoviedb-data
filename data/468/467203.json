There's a trip to the barber, icecream for the kids, the weekly football match and a beer at the pub. Come nightfall, it's either a movie or the local dance. This beautifully shot film by Academy Award winner Dean Semler captures all the atmosphere of a weekly ritual repeated in country towns right across Australia.","popularity":0.0489,"poster_path":"/6yQ5MVpVUyJL5N8D457lPrOsLNQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saturday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4501,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dean Semler","original_name":"Dean Semler","popularity":0.374,"profile_path":"/6GewzjGfuCc6fsf4f2ZsmDWp4Dl.jpg","credit_id":"59704e38c3a3687fc702f690","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1817247","wikidata_id":"Q123288523","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1058,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6yQ5MVpVUyJL5N8D457lPrOsLNQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
