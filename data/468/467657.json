The raid in 1943 was a success and a 1950s feature film carried the the Dambusters story into British legend. The science behind the bouncing bomb is highly complex, and many of Barnes Wallis' vital working calculations have been lost. Now, Cambridge engineer Dr Hugh Hunt, is going to attempt to solve the scientific puzzle of exactly how Wallis did it. Starting from scratch, he will rediscover the brilliance of Wallis's achievement when he tries to hit a dam with a bouncing bomb. It is the first time this has been attempted since the war.","popularity":0.2572,"poster_path":"/zd4uuaBZd0jUN3vQ2ZGFhqI5Ja5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8635,"logo_path":"/sNC3eCDuMbNhRCevAUIYbblJOjO.png","name":"Windfall Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"War Documentary hosted by Jim Carter, published by Channel 4 in 2011 - English narration","title":"Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Carter","original_name":"Jim Carter","popularity":0.6746,"profile_path":"/okiL3gc0mNqP0kPfMQHHvFjKnHb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"6474aa82be2d4900f994e7ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4087014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Hunt","original_name":"Hugh Hunt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Engineer","credit_id":"6474b0f6dd731b2d7b666216","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4087031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnie Schreder","original_name":"Arnie Schreder","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Pilot","credit_id":"6474b2cf9ae61300e5953054","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4087060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Donnelly","original_name":"Rick Donnelly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Dam Designer","credit_id":"6474b553be2d490133a52a1f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Duncan","original_name":"Ian Duncan","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6474abb09408ec00c28fab8e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Duncan","original_name":"Ian Duncan","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6474ab8abe2d4900f994e840","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Cook","original_name":"Tom Cook","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6474ab199408ec011f2cad07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1906354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zd4uuaBZd0jUN3vQ2ZGFhqI5Ja5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Exact date unknown","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
