Things started to change and everything slowly became something else. It was not clear if transformation was a symptom of the disease or a way to escape it. The contagion touched everything and everyone: animals and plants, stones and soil, men, women and children, their thoughts, their dreams, their memories. An old woman once told me how all memories turn into trees, I could hardly make out what she was saying. She said she could hear the trees singing: To be a body, to be any body. After the years of contagion ended, the cities appeared untouched. One had to look hard to see the traces of the previous time. If one could listen to the trees, what would they say? A way out, a way out?","popularity":0.183,"poster_path":"/vD5ygWFnHl5tYTjpLaIhJZ4FH4u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94594,"logo_path":"/g7w57j6Iyp1bsIj4ZnbwStIhfEP.png","name":"Flaneur Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fantasy Sentences","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fantasy Sentences","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Размышления о фантазии","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"59725220c3a3686fc703e9e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"59b12e5c9251410723082960","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"5e3bd2af98f1f1000f0b43d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":570540,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Apostolou","original_name":"Simon Apostolou","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3bd2c398f1f100120a7e58","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703571,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zsuzsanna Kiràly","original_name":"Zsuzsanna Kiràly","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3bd2f998f1f100140ae7a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530753,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Hemphill","original_name":"Aaron Hemphill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3bd493ac8e6b0018cac70f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134834,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jenny Lou Ziegel","original_name":"Jenny Lou Ziegel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3bd4d5ac8e6b0018cac7be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matilda Mester","original_name":"Matilda Mester","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3bda5a98f1f100180b8d13","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7219368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/CtfolJhuYkco61DqeX0BkisKm4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vD5ygWFnHl5tYTjpLaIhJZ4FH4u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1365},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rFe5heekVoxd9AEKuvaOPQfGFI2.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
