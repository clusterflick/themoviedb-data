While other buzzards migrate between cold northern continent and warm southern islands, they prefer to propagate in Taiwan. Ninety-nine Peaks is their major habitat. With different feather colors, this species can only be distinguished from other birds by their long narrow beak and sharp claws. However, it is certain that all oriental honey buzzards love to eat pupa of bees.
