The population is suffering, but the offenders stay with impunity. Many people see this conflict as one of globalisation's crucial econimic distribution battles because the country has major deposits of many high-tech raw materials. Milo Rau, one of Europe's most acclaimed theatre directors, succeeds in gathering victims, perpetrators, observes and analysts of the conflict for a unique civil tribunal in eastern Congo. The documentary film brings these spectacular court trials to life on the big screen and creates an unvarnished portrait of the largest and bloodiest economic wars in human history.","popularity":0.227,"poster_path":"/vy3FHNnMc1nyfjhWsPZ0FY9OvbW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Real Fiction","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Congo Tribunal","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Congo Tribunal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1683685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milo Rau","original_name":"Milo Rau","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/eeYyGn8rW9kSTrNPkE9D3MUh8KV.jpg","credit_id":"5974f5b792514157ec01baa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1683685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milo Rau","original_name":"Milo Rau","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/eeYyGn8rW9kSTrNPkE9D3MUh8KV.jpg","credit_id":"5ac8f8c0c3a36834d4048429","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arne Birkenstock","original_name":"Arne Birkenstock","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8f9860e0a264967048900","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11603,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katja Dringenberg","original_name":"Katja Dringenberg","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8fa2f92514162ab0454d8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcel Vaid","original_name":"Marcel Vaid","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8f9fbc3a36834d0042a95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033121,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guido Keller","original_name":"Guido Keller","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8fa3e92514162a2043681","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432515,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivier Zobrist","original_name":"Olivier Zobrist","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8f9c492514162ae04438c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7106414","wikidata_id":"Q42552896","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":950,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vy3FHNnMc1nyfjhWsPZ0FY9OvbW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lf14Y08HcuOtBVkLCTZc1NXfOvk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tf54mNhtToB5nEBor43T4zzR31q.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
