Celebrated throughout the New Orleans as “the prettiest,” for the beauty and inventiveness of his elaborately beaded Mardi Gras costumes, Tootie Montana masked for 52 years, longer than any other Mardi Gras Indian.  Yet Tootie Montana’s contributions to Mardi Gras Indian culture far exceed his artistic innovations and dedication. Through the example of his own achievement, he came to be revered for turning Mardi Gras Indians away from gang-style violence toward artistic accomplishment and competition.  In the aftermath of Katrina, TOOTIE’S LAST SUIT bears witness to the Mardi Gras Indians who, in picking up the threads of their torn lives and tradition, are the spiritual healers of New Orleans.","popularity":0.5294,"poster_path":"/8Clhlq9XsrAUxpwIHuvJRVbnbro.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tootie's Last Suit","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211454,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wynton Marsalis","original_name":"Wynton Marsalis","popularity":0.1914,"profile_path":"/h2jr42Hs5euyxAuemWFKw3mPevu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cc05d605adfb9eb95ba1c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. John","original_name":"Dr. John","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cc05dee9461adf414f77ab","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Katzman","original_name":"Lisa Katzman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597532e5c3a3685ded01f6aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0915474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Clhlq9XsrAUxpwIHuvJRVbnbro.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2411,"name":"new orleans, louisiana"},{"id":5497,"name":"mardi gras"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tootie's Last Suit Trailer","key":"r8xCDW8YJXU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2008-11-23T19:04:45.000Z","id":"67cc06719ef0acdb8b5b9d9d"}]}}}
