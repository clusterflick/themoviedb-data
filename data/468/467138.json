Monir created an artistic language that was informed by traditional Iranian craft and architecture; formative years spent in New York in the 1940s and 50s and ongoing conversations with some of the 20th century's most experimental artists were also part of Monir's artistic universe.  The film takes an intimate look at the artist's life and her practice, and explores how she has become one of the most innovative and influential artists working in the Middle East today. From her method of constructing mirror mosaics, to uncovering her past following the political changes in her own country and her subsequent migration to New York, and an artistic renewal sparked by her return to Tehran after an absence of 25 years, it offers an inspiring chronicle of Monir at the peak of her career.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/jsfwCZe4e12k9070VS6NyZxY40s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2017-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Kiarostami","original_name":"Bahman Kiarostami","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/8fuckijhQ5ERfQV4wXEHV9bsuiT.jpg","credit_id":"596f698dc3a368712800e44f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7155384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXkmpMLERroc4q7H8nL7XDv4mD8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":2143,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jsfwCZe4e12k9070VS6NyZxY40s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Monir - TRAILER","key":"FMr-G33hF0M","published_at":"2016-08-23T21:13:19.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"596f71789251412d3d023b5d"}]}}}
