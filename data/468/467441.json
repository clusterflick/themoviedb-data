Life didn't change much when he traded a $60k fee in favor of stock in a start-up called The Facebook, but now he is estimated to be worth over $250 million, highlighting a colorful career filled with giant street art installations, porn star affairs and investigative reporting for companies like Vice and CNN. Director and childhood friend Harry Kim guides us through the fantastically surreal life of Choe featuring interviews and appearances by Kevin Smith, Eli Roth, Sasha Grey, Sean Parker, and Shepard Fairey.","popularity":0.6188,"poster_path":"/5ztluYKvCUgmgDgVs6iNjQhbpe8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dirty Hands Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":97929,"logo_path":"/oQRFmBTxaCDRhqcHXHTMYWlw3Yl.png","name":"Multicom Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Choe: High Risk","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Choe","original_name":"David Choe","popularity":0.1457,"profile_path":"/4pfgq4XNmbXJCkgaZ1FBac3HBUh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de7a9dd954200044ef5ae9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kim","original_name":"Harry Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de7adfd0b43400477ab034","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Smith","original_name":"Kevin Smith","popularity":2.1917,"profile_path":"/uxDQ0NTZMnOuAaPa0tQzMFV9dx4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de871b9979d2007f48fdc1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shepard Fairey","original_name":"Shepard Fairey","popularity":0.2946,"profile_path":"/6SFXfEe3mA5O1tJacgQ21WBVzbK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de8739d95420002b5f6660","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Parker","original_name":"Sean Parker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de875f4ca6760075fc5e99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Roth","original_name":"Eli Roth","popularity":1.4246,"profile_path":"/qQTkpxzh1FlBGL1HD5hzdUMxv49.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de8898cb75d1007641a028","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kim","original_name":"Harry Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8789071650004611b527","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kim","original_name":"Harry Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de877fcb75d10030f4aed0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143249,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Will Vega","original_name":"Will Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de87ec344a8e00479a7233","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143248,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alan Solares","original_name":"Alan Solares","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de87ce4ca6760075fc5fa3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872028,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jesse Baritz","original_name":"Jesse Baritz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8816d0b434005ed2002c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143249,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Will Vega","original_name":"Will Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8826ef9d7200478f140b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938041,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darrin Holender","original_name":"Darrin Holender","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de87a9ef9d72002d965132","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kim","original_name":"Harry Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5972c807c3a3686fc70493c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4872320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ztluYKvCUgmgDgVs6iNjQhbpe8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2816,"name":"street art"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
