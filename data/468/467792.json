With the smell of coffee and doughnuts lingering over a table filled with pencil shavings, director Milan Erceg delves into the personal lives of each of the participating artist to examine how and why they got into an industry that rarely rewards their passion with fame or money. Further exploring the business of comic art, Erceg peppers in interviews from an impressive list of nationally recognized comic book experts including, Scott McCloud, cartoonist and author of “Understanding Comics”, Paul Guinan creator of “Boilerplate”, David Chelsea, acclaimed graphic novelist, Mike Richardson, founder of Dark Horse Comics and many others. An inspiring look into the art world’s version of a marathon, 24 Hour Comic leaves the audience with a deeper appreciation for the artists who spend a life creating.","popularity":0.1078,"poster_path":"/gynl9bvlS2ni8zMEMpGbuJlUvp0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24 Hour Comic","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084932,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Milan Erceg","original_name":"Milan Erceg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59760d95c3a3680d2b01422c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5940300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gynl9bvlS2ni8zMEMpGbuJlUvp0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"24 HOUR COMIC documentary official trailer","key":"-S40tmv2RTQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-30T01:07:50.000Z","id":"5c884e920e0a26042bc0dae0"}]}}}
