From re-enacting the arrival of the First Fleet and the birth of John Macarthur's wool-producing enterprise, the film then turns to the present, focusing on rural production, industrial efficiency and the splendid urban landscape of Sydney. As the introductory title grandly proclaims: \"From so small a beginning has sprung the virile Australian Nation.\" Frank Hurley, at the peak of his fame as a photographer, film maker and adventurer, was the obvious choice to direct the film and he delivered spectacular imagery and patriotic commentary with gusto.","popularity":0.0528,"poster_path":"/5Cdy5ByOF4J3tOUo6LIxSZTjm7J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Nation is Built","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Hurley","original_name":"Frank Hurley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59704caa9251415e860188f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0203017","wikidata_id":"Q123289251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Cdy5ByOF4J3tOUo6LIxSZTjm7J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
