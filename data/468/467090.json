When a fight is coming up Muhammad Ali (formally Cassius Marcellus Clay, junior) admits he deliberately intimidates his opponent. He does this because historically in America black people have always been taught to be subservient.  ’Muhammad Ali V Cathal O’Shannon′ was filmed in RTÉ Television’s Studio 1 on 17 July 1972. It was first broadcast on 18 July 1972, the night before the fight with Al ‘Blue’ Lewis at Croke Park. The programme was re-mastered in 2008. This was re-edited and re-transmitted as ‘When Ali Met Cathal’ on 5 January 2009.","popularity":0.3618,"poster_path":"/6e2o2bz8fRpVzBio66kDcAnIGYg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2009-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cathal O’Shannon interviews Muhammad Ali about boxing, and his life outside the ring.","title":"When Ali Met Cathal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhammad Ali","original_name":"Muhammad Ali","popularity":0.4506,"profile_path":"/u1ck2Lfx34GvW3YOoEE1ddNVdw6.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Muhammad Ali","credit_id":"596f0d42c3a368712800926a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1854203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathal O'Shannon","original_name":"Cathal O'Shannon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cathal O’Shannon","credit_id":"596f0d55c3a3687128009280","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hDMxJw4lDHY1zWk9RLVyzshys5M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6e2o2bz8fRpVzBio66kDcAnIGYg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
