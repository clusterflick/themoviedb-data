The players were, and are, household names – Barassi, Skilton, Jesaulenko, Davis, Hart, Nicholls, Mann, Dugdale, Fraser. Most didn’t own passports. Most had barely been out of Victoria. Ex-umpire and media juggernaut Harry Beitzel was the man who made it happen. He mortgaged his house. He organised the opponent. He flew his team of champions on a milk run to Darwin, Hong Kong, Paris, Dublin, London, New York and beyond to plant the seed of international competition. The Galahs is a rare feature film that reconnects fans with all time greats of both VFL and GAA football.","popularity":0.3779,"poster_path":"/36RpbjWYNlnr5RycaCU8Da5TtJs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madman","origin_country":""},{"id":176991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sepia Tones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2016-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Galahs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3468233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Barassi","original_name":"Ron Barassi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a59b418efe73112cf37692","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Beitzel","original_name":"Harry Beitzel","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a59b4ce38bd8322834424e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Wilson","original_name":"Tony Wilson","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a59b0985005d4c07bc2fd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cam Fink","original_name":"Cam Fink","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a59abc7f6c8d54f074483c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Heath","original_name":"Rob Heath","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a59ac953866e0ddfaafff9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5902576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/geU8PmvLUzKRL01FFhAjZkpBAoo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1403,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AnsWjim0U7YoRQr7vmqfjM5930L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/36RpbjWYNlnr5RycaCU8Da5TtJs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193761,"name":"australian rules football"},{"id":255435,"name":"australian football league (afl)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Galahs - Official Trailer","key":"gHnJ_cxWFpo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2016-11-09T06:27:07.000Z","id":"631a00af6f43ec007b18b222"}]}}}
