It is not necessary for visitors to stay for the entire duration - they can come and go as they please. Created by Anthony McCall, it is based on the architectural framing of time and light. It came at the end of a series of works in which McCall was stripping back cinema to its absolute minimum - light, time, and human experience/perception.","popularity":0.4492,"poster_path":"/aLcxTWm2DOTFuqG7kT3lSJEJlrh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":1440,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Film for Ambient Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony McCall","original_name":"Anthony McCall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/caVwYIj8hNRnmBHUu3nJG9rU3YP.jpg","credit_id":"5e38b104ac8e6b001ac773fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLcxTWm2DOTFuqG7kT3lSJEJlrh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158697,"name":"installation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Staged inside the Idea Warehouse","release_date":"1975-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
