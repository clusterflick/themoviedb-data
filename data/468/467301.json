In 1999, Bachar collaborated with The Atlas Group to produce 53 videotapes about his captivity. Tapes #17 and #31 are the only two tapes Bachar makes available outside of Lebanon. In the tapes, Bachar addresses the cultural, textual, and sexual aspects of his detention with the Americans.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eNPWEAMgnlttF82PP0m2Cyr5KFN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hostage: The Bachar Tapes (English Version)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walid Raad","original_name":"Walid Raad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597147e7c3a368712802dc13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eNPWEAMgnlttF82PP0m2Cyr5KFN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p0D13h2LjL1IIiNcxso0YicQYGU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
