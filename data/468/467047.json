Set to atmospheric sounds and a pulsating hum, the 43-minute piece looks back from an imagined future upon the post-Anthropocene: the aftermath of significant human influence on Earth. An army of scientists appear to investigate the archaeological remnants of civilization after humanity has made itself extinct. Shot entirely using a drone, Rosefeldt’s images hover meditatively over the desolate landscape and ruins. Connoting surveillance, the drone’s bird’s eye view removes human perspective with us onlookers kept at a distance throughout. Increasingly, more figures dressed in white lab suits emerge to inspect the ruins of civilization – which are in fact abandoned film sets close to the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Land of Drought","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Rosefeldt","original_name":"Julian Rosefeldt","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/hMsWR51LkNLHfo86qNk27gC0brX.jpg","credit_id":"596e721fc3a368015401228e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
