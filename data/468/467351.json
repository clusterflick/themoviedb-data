Bush's administration as wounded soldiers in the war against terrorism, RE:THE_OPERATION explores the sexual and philosophical dynamics of war through the lives of the members as they physically engage each other and the \"enemy.\" Letters, notes, and digital snapshots \"produced\" by the members on their tour of duty become the basis of video portraits that articulate the neuroses and obsessions compelling them toward an infinite war. Part M*A*S*H*, part Three's Company, part philosophical meditation (with a dash of character assassination thrown in) RE:THE_OPERATION exists as a single channel video and a set of desktop replacement icons for MAC and PC.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/32BrcbroRodKnwQZioZ4ADK1jP2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RE:THE_OPERATION","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Chan","original_name":"Paul Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5971e3d2c3a3684c700066c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/32BrcbroRodKnwQZioZ4ADK1jP2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
