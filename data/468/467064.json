Voices that fight for his attention and demand his subordination. On his daily, semi-hypnotic journeys through his alienating, colorless city, he searches for companionship and happiness. He thinks he finds it when he meets the girl he loves - but to whom he never speaks. This surreal, magical and philosophically charged tale examines the life of an outcast as he struggles to blend into a world where everyone searches for their own uniqueness.","popularity":0.3874,"poster_path":"/mszBtOv5sE2nlxQdRJ5t0tD30hF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mad Machine Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest is Red","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1397208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devin Harjes","original_name":"Devin Harjes","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Nathan","credit_id":"596e9f95c3a3687fc70145ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Sudhaus","original_name":"Nicole Sudhaus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Naomi","credit_id":"596e9fa69251412d4c01480c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Deitch","original_name":"Kathy Deitch","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/2IMHIxvi7a2OatV0BzwJcpARZUT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"596e9fb8c3a36871620004e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1854076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Sacer","original_name":"Dora Sacer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Katie","credit_id":"596e9fc79251412d4c014822","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":968977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omer Barnea","original_name":"Omer Barnea","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":"/aHAxzvcDnxPoAT592ZIaLhA90tQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Photographer","credit_id":"596e9fdbc3a3680145014e51","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1854077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kara Addington","original_name":"Kara Addington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ashleigh","credit_id":"596e9ff0c3a3680154014441","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Afton Jillian","original_name":"Afton Jillian","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/5au8po2BUw416lCM1o6Ldyfix7a.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Singer","credit_id":"596ea0149251412d3d015794","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Jakubovic","original_name":"David Jakubovic","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596ea057c3a3680145014ea5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Jakubovic","original_name":"David Jakubovic","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596ea0699251412d7b01509f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1754631","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.652,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mszBtOv5sE2nlxQdRJ5t0tD30hF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":652}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"European Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2012-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Forest is Red (2011) Movie Trailer HD","key":"UcxYAU4uAZQ","published_at":"2011-08-15T18:49:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"596ea1d2c3a3686b5a00c555"}]}}}
