However, his pedantic attitude dulls the locals, who start to rebel against his impositions. Spaced out by imaginative stories about wives transformed into goats and offered as gifts to Gods, Abrantes's revision is a game of mirrors, in which a fantastic tale alternates with another, representing a vibrant and colorful context where folklore, myth and modern myths such as Robert Patterson of Twilight overlap each other.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/iqEmMr07sBhc8k8wYf68ZxnDOeP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junior Casséus","original_name":"Junior Casséus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67dcd68b5f977836ab7a5a8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tilmé Stéphanie","original_name":"Tilmé Stéphanie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67dcd696338e77783ff53bf1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anise Dieudanné","original_name":"Anise Dieudanné","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67dcd6a2adf21a1668f53a95","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Beaunéfils","original_name":"Antoine Beaunéfils","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67dcd6ac0416875adc696f40","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Charment","original_name":"Nicolas Charment","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67dcd6b91cda1dbb467a5ded","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Abrantes","original_name":"Gabriel Abrantes","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/cfd7kZufiqyAfceZrAnHyNB1ETJ.jpg","credit_id":"5970f94c9251417fef003a22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Abrantes","original_name":"Gabriel Abrantes","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/cfd7kZufiqyAfceZrAnHyNB1ETJ.jpg","credit_id":"67dcd7225f977836ab7a5aaa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Abrantes","original_name":"Gabriel Abrantes","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/cfd7kZufiqyAfceZrAnHyNB1ETJ.jpg","credit_id":"67dcd731d68104527969727d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Abrantes","original_name":"Gabriel Abrantes","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/cfd7kZufiqyAfceZrAnHyNB1ETJ.jpg","credit_id":"67dcd737d681045279697280","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Abrantes","original_name":"Gabriel Abrantes","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/cfd7kZufiqyAfceZrAnHyNB1ETJ.jpg","credit_id":"67dcd741338e77783ff53c1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natxo Checa","original_name":"Natxo Checa","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dcd74fd681045279697284","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iqEmMr07sBhc8k8wYf68ZxnDOeP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
