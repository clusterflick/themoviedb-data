With everything gone overnight, Seung-woo spends every day meaninglessly in a small attic room but is comforted by Ga-hee who is like a mother, a sister and a lover.  He starts developing feelings for her while writing poems and reading books with sounds of piano played by Ga-hee in the background.  It's been a year since Seung-woo stayed in that house, then one cold winter night, he leaves behind a note thanking the lady for everything. Thirteen years later, Seung-woo, Dong-hee and Ga-hee reunite but he's become a corrupted 32-year old addicted to smoking, drinking and women. The two girls can't help but be shocked at the way he turned out.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qreyRzr5ubeg5DRarJtiFtHg8ML.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Mio Dea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hae Hwan","original_name":"Hae Hwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597138edc3a3686f7c0246f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qreyRzr5ubeg5DRarJtiFtHg8ML.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
