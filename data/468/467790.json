Now they face the next step in their life: marriage. They are no different from ordinary couples in Korea when marriage is concerned. Woo-young is forty years old. Ever since his father died, he could no longer delay his marriage with Jae-nyun and openly proposes to her several times. On the other hand, Jae-nyun, who was happy with Woo-young's first marriage proposal, experiences difficulty in giving a definite answer to Woo-young. She is worried about married life. To make matters worse, her future mother-in-law makes an interview of how she accepts Jae-nyun as her daughter-in-law, which suffocates Jae-nyun even more with the patriarchal custom the marriage system hides beneath the surface.","popularity":0.1117,"poster_path":"/6ogYX07C9dtFXYtWLWZt2W2AYFJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":125981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ozi Film","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea of Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jae-Nyeon","original_name":"Jae-Nyeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"재년","credit_id":"6308bf18c39266007ac8a8e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wooyoung","original_name":"Wooyoung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"우영","credit_id":"6308bf230398ab00829f848a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1715282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Bae-il","original_name":"Park Bae-il","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e47053f8ede003f699d17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2170231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moon Chang-hyeon","original_name":"Moon Chang-hyeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vIiKSlCxLwzqtvmLehHLbzdudHl.jpg","credit_id":"600e46f5cb8028003f05494f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2161546,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lee Seung-hun","original_name":"Lee Seung-hun","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e471efac502003fdd177b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2087888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ogYX07C9dtFXYtWLWZt2W2AYFJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
