During extra time of the final match of the 2006 World Cup, pitting France against Italy, the French leader, superstar Zidane, for some unknown reason took a running start and head-butted Materazzi in the chest. Zidane was sent off the field and, as a result, the French lost the match on penalties. This head-butt and the unexpected loss were now bound together in the minds of sports fans forever. But the burning question - why did it happen? – has never been properly answered. After thoroughly studying the lives of the participants in this match, the filmmakers reveal an amazing story: The 2006 World Cup appears to us in the form of a play “directed by the Creator”.","popularity":0.1986,"poster_path":"/aeiMZ65yBrn4K4cTKbTgTyMdvu2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17349,"logo_path":"/s3r5PhMAEYOyHrxG6epNGkUbxyw.png","name":"2Plan2","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Soccer
