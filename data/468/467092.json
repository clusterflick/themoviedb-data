The world was watching our small nation as the future of equality for Ireland’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people was up for debate and ultimately a national decision.  The Story of Yes, a new documentary for RTÉ2 airing exactly a year later, brings us back to this momentous day, and marks another important anniversary in 2016. The story is told through the eyes of those who it mattered to most – the LGBT community and their families. Through powerful and emotional interviews, the programme will transport the viewers back to the lead up to the vote, capturing the highs and lows of the campaign as people took to the streets, their computer screens and the airways to tell their stories and fight for marriage equality.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/pGwk9EyvKZvoajL0O4BaMOlpUEo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92641,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invisible Thread Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"On the first anniversary of the Referendum, The Story of Yes revisits the hopes, fears and ultimately celebration of a day when Ireland said yes to marriage equality.","title":"The Story Of Yes","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1854213,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugh Rodgers","original_name":"Hugh Rodgers","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596f17f0c3a3687128009b6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5798108","wikidata_id":"Q27042105","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPfK5tcWrIQ9CqVEwalbpSFlzwm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h4mpaLzPfNxsSfHoCER4qQ1BLWp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pGwk9EyvKZvoajL0O4BaMOlpUEo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v4XkmDyrfhWAsEIhnafJ6FVjYKr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Story of Yes | RTÉ2","key":"Iq2BOi_HCHo","published_at":"2016-05-20T13:27:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"596f1865c3a3686fc7003992"}]}}}
