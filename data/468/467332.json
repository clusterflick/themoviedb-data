When Claudine investigates the case of a soldier convicted of rape, she discovers that his trial was unfair and that he was convicted on the basis of little evidence. In her journey to obtain justice, she uncovers a system where the basic principles of law are ignored. And when the system fails, everyone becomes a victim. The documentary not only provides a glimpse into the failings of the Congolese judicial system but also raises questions about the role of the international community and non-governmental organizations in reforming it.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Justice for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilse van Velzen","original_name":"Ilse van Velzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9d60eb3316b00ed5010b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Femke van Velzen","original_name":"Femke van Velzen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9d61eeda4b70089b43074","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
