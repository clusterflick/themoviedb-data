Ramona lives in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. Every day she travels four hours and a half to reach her job and to get back home. She divides her working time between two upper middle-class homes where she receives the name of Réimon, a sound that evokes the English language, a Buenos Aires upper class snobbish custom.  It´s fiction and it´s not. It´s also a film about the labour conditions of a worker, about the time this worker uses for working and the efforts that implies working. It´s also about the absurdity of cleaning someone else´s house, the absurdity of modern life and the differences between social classes.","popularity":0.1072,"poster_path":"/bCJCHRQSZIvkAzCx0UlKS4qlJvE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compañia Amateur","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":18485,"logo_path":"/q49Qk6zMyhWVjowLXlpoboONqHx.png","name":"Rohfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11999,"logo_path":"/50K9W66YeWjOalNcjWddPcSgIYO.png","name":"Universidad del Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2014-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reimon","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcela Dias","original_name":"Marcela Dias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ramona","credit_id":"5eef36716f6a990038cd90fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esteban Bigliardi","original_name":"Esteban Bigliardi","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":"/s9GB7XRNO8Z75JhomNW4KZoZdMJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eef3679ed2ac200359ce68f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Rainero","original_name":"Cecilia Rainero","popularity":0.1132,"profile_path":"/5s1Hwa9Krpcly5KDjcMv3wWCpzj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eef36822e2b2c00366caf0c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Dubner","original_name":"Bruno Dubner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eef3688b0cd200034b7213e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juvelina Dias","original_name":"Juvelina Dias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5eef369110dad60033bda43b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Moreno","original_name":"Rodrigo Moreno","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/ffrwertO1hAdl8H7wxIlbqWHzby.jpg","credit_id":"549d9e5fc3a3682f160060a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Moreno","original_name":"Rodrigo Moreno","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/ffrwertO1hAdl8H7wxIlbqWHzby.jpg","credit_id":"646effac1130bd01eb25847c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Moreno","original_name":"Rodrigo Moreno","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/ffrwertO1hAdl8H7wxIlbqWHzby.jpg","credit_id":"646f015e1130bd01ec9749da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Moreno","original_name":"Rodrigo Moreno","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/ffrwertO1hAdl8H7wxIlbqWHzby.jpg","credit_id":"5eef35a0c86b3a0035470aeb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3508514","wikidata_id":"Q118646467","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bCJCHRQSZIvkAzCx0UlKS4qlJvE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1127}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2014-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
