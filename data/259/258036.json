Documentary-style footage is combined with staged events. Despite the piece's lack of a traditional narrative, it bears some relationship to nature works.  The segment features material from \"Il Corpo Scuro (The dark body)\" - animals and natural environments are seen up close and at a distance.","popularity":0.4341,"poster_path":"/uyCnnpW52YZ35WrTkvHZXSGzmJN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Viola Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668163d699c567ae38ff15bf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","credit_id":"5319a10a92514177bc002404","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kira Perov","original_name":"Kira Perov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668162bafc06d4af6eff1a36","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","credit_id":"66816316cec673f92c1e2865","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kira Perov","original_name":"Kira Perov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668162c799c567ae38ff15b3","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","credit_id":"668163c467d3e1701647db68","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0230316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7izXmKKH7ZtqrgBakY9fyL7HHvG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uyCnnpW52YZ35WrTkvHZXSGzmJN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zUNV9TkE3y3snSQTkmsbmoybSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":161219,"name":"consciousness"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bill Viola - Owl - I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like 1986","key":"C0YgJV7H4NA","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-08-31T00:16:44.000Z","id":"668160dd1ed9271c091e28e9"}]}}}
