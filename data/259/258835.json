For many, the swastika has become a symbol synonymous with the Nazis and fascism. But this film reveals the fascinating and complex history of an emblem that is, in fact, a religious symbol, with a sacred past.  For the almost one billion Hindus around the world, the swastika lies at the heart of religious practices and beliefs, as an emblem of benevolence, luck and good fortune.","popularity":1.1603,"poster_path":"/xqtOha6O7XrTWt6P6pKrzTXeViH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of the Swastika","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1225234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Rani","original_name":"Anita Rani","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/wDS2w8THLcBqHdtVYphhpCHQXxS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5c38c9e30e0a264437ffba5c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Cox","original_name":"Anna Cox","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/o8UOqS5Z4ADhCzLap5K6BfFdW8O.jpg","credit_id":"531e62edc3a368363f001271","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1048473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tommy Nagra","original_name":"Tommy Nagra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"531e6307c3a368363f001276","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Cox","original_name":"Anna Cox","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/o8UOqS5Z4ADhCzLap5K6BfFdW8O.jpg","credit_id":"531e631ac3a3685c5d008d28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3314454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xLOqpYZc3zFKH1l9YUeov8JjfIW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xqtOha6O7XrTWt6P6pKrzTXeViH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1345}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6194,"name":"hinduism"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
