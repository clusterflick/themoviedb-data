One day, she finds her client dead in his bed after a night of lovemaking. A policeman played by Hervé P. Gustave conducting the investigation.  There are excellent camera movement and sets and lights are baroque. There is a narration which has an opening 15 minutes without sex and details rare in this type of production are present as OVIDIE that turns a kind of passage that is unable to bend.  In fact, to have advantages as surprising, the film was directed by Martin Cognito. He is a director of cinema tradionnel hiding under a hood not to be recognize! All is fine, except for an end too agreed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/45ZcDKbJsyELqMGKGnRmAJ39A3g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claudine","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":146436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ovidie","original_name":"Ovidie","popularity":6.021,"profile_path":"/um7PDSGbrqUw8YpgP7DalWUtwEz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Claudine","credit_id":"535f66480e0a264fe5007bd7","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1282595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hervé P.
