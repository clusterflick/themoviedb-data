In the \"Visite,\" the artist -admirer of Picasso, rebellious disciple of Breton- is presented in solitude, far from the tumult of the exhibitions and parisian circles. An austere approach, almost “povera”, with no audio, nor flashy camera movements, but rarely attractive. Why Resnais could not finish his movie? Hope one of our experts help us to solve the mystery.","popularity":0.5747,"poster_path":"/2r04jQjgpsY3kWynq6f7JsJQvGC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1947-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visite à Oscar Dominguez","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Dominguez","original_name":"Oscar Dominguez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5316d48dc3a3681388002064","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Resnais","original_name":"Alain Resnais","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":"/q5LF4OZ7BhNH44Jb9UDg3af57R9.jpg","credit_id":"5316d4a2c3a3681388002069","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Resnais","original_name":"Alain Resnais","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":"/q5LF4OZ7BhNH44Jb9UDg3af57R9.jpg","credit_id":"5316d4b6c3a36813b4002154","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0209467","wikidata_id":"Q3561089","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2r04jQjgpsY3kWynq6f7JsJQvGC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
