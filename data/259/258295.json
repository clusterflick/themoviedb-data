Due to the urgent need for investment and the poor booking situation, all financial reserves have been used up and Sabrina urgently needs another loan from her bank to avert the threat of bankruptcy. On her way to London, she unexpectedly meets her childhood friend Lisa, who left her home country some time ago and until recently worked in a law firm in London. She has now resigned because she has realized that her boss Vince Stevens appreciates her as an employee but has no other ambitions. The two spontaneously decide to swap their \"lives\" for a short time: Lisa takes over the management of the hotel in Sabrina's place and Sabrina moves into Lisa's apartment in London and tries to reorganize her life.","popularity":0.5287,"poster_path":"/6AsjI2aMgoQhThk6bFAvEMAKwrO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosamunde Pilcher: Wohin Du auch gehst","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Schütt","original_name":"Sophie Schütt","popularity":0.3665,"profile_path":"/oCDO42i8xLOGIpuJzs6kmBU6DVx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lisa Moore","credit_id":"55a1b5dbc3a3681cec001ea3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicki von Tempelhoff","original_name":"Nicki von Tempelhoff","popularity":0.2855,"profile_path":"/qDXvUgZkX3KRgBNvzpXVLUuJZIM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vince Stevens","credit_id":"55a1b5f7925141297d002200","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krista Stadler","original_name":"Krista Stadler","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/bxZ5VNeUQZS9W7vTuGiZfPafZv7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tilla Brown","credit_id":"55a1b614925141296e00227e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Davidson","original_name":"Stuart Davidson","popularity":0.4322,"profile_path":"/Wti4IHoN7Dl207OzQtDAqry9Wa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hotel Guest","credit_id":"5e92040bcb71b80014f89888","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Alexander Kuschewski","original_name":"Daniel Alexander Kuschewski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/siu903Anp5avboBMi1rmsGwy7Hi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bob Makenzie","credit_id":"5fb42f51945c20003fedc4e4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Schoenenberger","original_name":"René Schoenenberger","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/4Gbn2sHZ5vGWAREhrZeo52ksqqa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Paddington","credit_id":"5fb42f64c15f8900408b2b08","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsten Aarden","original_name":"Kirsten Aarden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"5fb42f8c3a48c5003f83dfbc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Antony-Barber","original_name":"Paul Antony-Barber","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/32SaHEc08KHmiFo5hmIly8JcdRt.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Butler Edgar","credit_id":"5fb42fb87352050040185433","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian von Klitzing","original_name":"Fabian von Klitzing","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/v0CEEDX3Hx83IjZpmcd7jCZBgCq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Harding","credit_id":"5fb42fc9eb64f10042780e2a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1241922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Warmuth","original_name":"Nadine Warmuth","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/mR4Mvhdm3s2AhW9dbabUjUZMFgy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sabrina Wellington","credit_id":"5fb42fec3a48c5003d84b75e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Jürgen Tögel","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Tögel","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54bf8addc3a3686c6100e7d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1545890","wikidata_id":"Q3024712","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kCQHzyINxjoCG6LGUZEn9ZUC2Il.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svXLQQiZMClTDiF2NCA4BfKyqab.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tI7wbSVCsCAfIc1hCZ66nv9EvSh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6AsjI2aMgoQhThk6bFAvEMAKwrO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
