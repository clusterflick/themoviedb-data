The film incorporates a record of the subversive underbelly of the city into a poetic meditation on conspiracy theory, ecoterrorism, time and cinema, retracing the story of The Third Man. Adapted from a trilogy of Whitehead's own Nohzone novels, the objective and subjective becomes blurred as the film director merges with the fictional detective in a journey into the murky activities of covert counter-insurgency groups. Kaleidoscopic in intent, the film mixes Noh theatre, Victorian novels, Vienna after the war, opium, domain names and Jacob's ladder \"pitched twixt Heaven and Charring Cross\".","popularity":0.1413,"poster_path":"/g1u3wphy1K23d63o6w229B2Tqt8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrorism Considered as One of the Fine Arts","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Berger","original_name":"Samantha Berger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a312bf2c3a36814ae000838","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Strohmeier","original_name":"Sophie Strohmeier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a312c0d0e0a264cbc190171","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liza Tsyzina-Whitehead","original_name":"Liza Tsyzina-Whitehead","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a312c1a925141547200087a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Woodrow","original_name":"Joanna Woodrow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a312c28c3a3680b9d176a64","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Schneider","original_name":"Alice Schneider","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/hXDzcPswZZHopiTIqWwbwaouCVH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65dd0ccbeea34d0131b0f6ac","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Whitehead","original_name":"Peter Whitehead","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/8wbAQrzkOeqF366j3bsj2BTOl0z.jpg","credit_id":"531aef3092514177b7003a98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Whitehead","original_name":"Peter Whitehead","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/8wbAQrzkOeqF366j3bsj2BTOl0z.jpg","credit_id":"5a312c4d925141547200089e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Strohmeier","original_name":"Sophie Strohmeier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a312c3d9251410324184c6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Erber","original_name":"Nina Erber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a312c62c3a368148f000817","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3113620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g1u3wphy1K23d63o6w229B2Tqt8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Viennale","release_date":"2009-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
