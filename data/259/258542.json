In the journey of composer and musician Vinicio Capossela through the taverns of Athens and Thessalonica, this film records his music, his wandering life, and his travel journal, revealing at the same time the collective scars the crisis has left in a place where everything seems to have lost its value.","popularity":0.1231,"poster_path":"/vOWCOVHqYy0QAMipxoGJKiyOsBA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244913,"logo_path":null,"name":"LaCupa","origin_country":""},{"id":14556,"logo_path":"/tYNprelutzBIYS68EZsSBGxpQV.png","name":"Jolefilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI
