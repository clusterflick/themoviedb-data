The band played an explosive \"Scheme\" to start, followed immediately by the classic \"Artifact\" track \"Vibyl\". A rowdy \"Instantly\" had the crowd worked into a frenzy and a beautiful version of \"Circus\" followed. The old favorites kept coming with \"Warrior\", \"Arigato\" and \"Blu Mood\", which features a masterful guitar riff nailed by Hunter Brown. To kick off the second set, the band performed a dance-inducing version of \"Kabuki\". Set 2 continued the trend of STS9's most recent tour theme that blend the old with the new. Established favorites \"F.Word\" and \"One A Day\" were played amidst \"20-12\" and \"March\". During Rent, David Phipps' now famous haunting synthesizer riff had Athens fans waving their arms in unison. A powerful encore started with the funky \"Wika Chikana\". The band closed with \"Kamuy\", a song featuring Zach Velmer and Jeffree Lerner dueling on drums, showcasing the heartbeat of STS9.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STS9: 2013.03.22 - Georgia Theatre, Athens, GA","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hunter Brown","original_name":"Hunter Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"546cebbac3a368097d001f50","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alana Rocklin","original_name":"Alana Rocklin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"546cebcdc3a3680976001f46","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffree Lerner","original_name":"Jeffree Lerner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"546cebe7c3a368097d001f58","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Phipps","original_name":"David Phipps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"546cebfb9251413056001f0e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Velmer","original_name":"Zach Velmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"546cec0bc3a368096b001de1","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
