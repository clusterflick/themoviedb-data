It's quite obvious thanks to the chunky retro-futuristic look he captured with the interior design of the ships, which pay homage to that era of scifi. Beaulieu chose to marry a more stylized look for the characters with more realistic animation, which actually ended up working pretty well within the confines of this mini narrative.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malaise","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Beaulieu","original_name":"Daniel Beaulieu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"531c13a992514177b1005281","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Beaulieu","original_name":"Daniel Beaulieu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5a28fe0e0a267fd100ca12","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Beaulieu","original_name":"Daniel Beaulieu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5a28c70e0a267fe000cc9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CGI & VFX Animated Shorts : 'MALAISE\" - by Daniel Beaulieu","key":"fsTZTyUyNnU","published_at":"2014-03-11T01:35:17.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"540b10dfc3a368799f001646"}]}}}
