Today, the film is considered one of the few undisputed masterpieces of the New Austrian Cinema: a freewheeling, tender, and strangely humorous portrait of working-class (and out-of-work) lives.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/a7E4ViWiPj3RxnO5QAotOaWd4Ss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141108,"logo_path":null,"name":"ebf-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clinch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann
