The kids are rebelling and the parents doesnâ€™t know how to deal with them. With their parents consent, the children are abducted and bundled into a van which takes them to a reform school in the middle of the desert, in Utah. Blending fact with fiction, Carlsen shows us how parents sometimes achieve control by surrendering it and how fabrications can help us understand real life.","popularity":0.1519,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just the Right Amount of Violence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","original_name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/qwPxGQ6IKuW7gt6JB034CKkHXtj.jpg","credit_id":"53564b2ec3a36841e50021e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","original_name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/qwPxGQ6IKuW7gt6JB034CKkHXtj.jpg","credit_id":"53564b27c3a36841ee0022dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112732,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Morten Giese","original_name":"Morten Giese","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/tF5wHf4RaBbgAx4N9uuW4qKb3hj.jpg","credit_id":"5f82835341465c003713526d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","original_name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/qwPxGQ6IKuW7gt6JB034CKkHXtj.jpg","credit_id":"5f8283470284200037145468","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086519,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marietta von Hausswolff von Baumgarten","original_name":"Marietta von Hausswolff von Baumgarten","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f82836f6082eb0038e70f3a","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1032097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hilda Rasula","original_name":"Hilda Rasula","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f82832a1065d30035d39da3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415296,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"RIKKE SELIN- LORENTZEN","original_name":"RIKKE SELIN- LORENTZEN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f82835c91b5300038b7f2c2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helena Danielsson","original_name":"Helena Danielsson","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/fmmQvQ5mBInioJ6ydC2Q8zmdFoZ.jpg","credit_id":"5f8287551065d30034d22cd6","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974681,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helle Ulsteen","original_name":"Helle Ulsteen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f828772fa27f4003cd6b7e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2593270","wikidata_id":"Q20728993","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
