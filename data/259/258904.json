The empty space of a bare apartment welcomes the fleeting encounters of these two strangers. The backdrop is the enveloping and rarefied city, the stage of their liaison and at the same time the protagonist of the film. The city with its urban structure codifies the watershed between the social classes and allows us to glimpse its balances and rules. The encounters, the bare dialogues between the protagonists, give voice to a paradigmatic distance of a society that is s/finite and without redemption, surrendered to the dominant values ​​that the protagonist, in the end, questions in an attempt to arrive at a new reformulation.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/i1mv16JAamCJzyA34TXFJgTEy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penultimo paesaggio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonin Desprairies","original_name":"Antonin Desprairies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"531f57cbc3a3685c56009e3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Levrone","original_name":"Luciano Levrone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"531f57d5c3a3685baa00270f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simona Rossi","original_name":"Simona Rossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"531f57e1c3a3685baa002715","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Ferraro","original_name":"Fabrizio Ferraro","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/8QkduRpVFUOnv2UTDaasIA5Smfb.jpg","credit_id":"531f57bbc3a3685c5d009f4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2134113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i1mv16JAamCJzyA34TXFJgTEy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
