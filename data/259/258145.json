It became a symbol of the new times touted by the Nazi regime.  The title (literally \"morning-red\") is the German term for the reddish coloring of the east sky about a half hour before the sunrise.  On patrol Captain Liers and his submarine crew sink an important British ship, but while returning to harbour, they're lured into a trap by a British vessel disguised as a neutral Danish one. They sink it after it attacks them without warning, but  while they prepare to rescue survivors, a British destroyer sinks the sub.  On the sea bed 60 feet down, with all but the bridge flooded, the 10 surviving crew have only 8 rescue devices. Liers orders the crew to use them, but they disobey - either all escape or nobody does.","popularity":0.5004,"poster_path":"/qFS7OWzvv9Ns8RsG6RG0OffrvgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1933-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dawn","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"l'Aube
