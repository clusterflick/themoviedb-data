It was the largest protest gathering yet, and it brought together a wide cross-section of liberals, radicals, hippies, and Yippies. Che Guevara had been killed in Bolivia only two weeks previously, and, for many, it was the transition from simply marching against the war, to taking direct action to try to stop the 'American war machine.' Norman Mailer wrote about the events in Armies of the Night. French filmmaker Chris Marker, leading a team of filmmakers, was also there.","popularity":0.4044,"poster_path":"/yQbV5oLuZhQszZX7hf7gpJZPlJK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Societe pour le Lancement des Oeuvres Nouvelles (SLON)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":77233,"logo_path":null,"name":"France Opera Film","origin_country":""},{"id":745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Pléiade","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1968-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sixth Side of the Pentagon","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Sixth Side of the Pentagon","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La sesta faccia del Pentagono","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Pentagons sjätte sida","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Marker","original_name":"Chris Marker","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/4hcLsvsYKcjx5oJJ0IshXK9L1l9.jpg","credit_id":"531cc63dc3a3685c5d006cce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Reichenbach","original_name":"François Reichenbach","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":"/vvhbUSypqTRHgAcrPbHq6HtY0uz.jpg","credit_id":"5371125f0e0a2661500004cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Braunberger","original_name":"Catherine Braunberger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5743036ac3a36816170000ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Marker","original_name":"Chris Marker","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/4hcLsvsYKcjx5oJJ0IshXK9L1l9.jpg","credit_id":"57430381925141541f001b87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507070,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carlos de los Llanos","original_name":"Carlos de los Llanos","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574303af9251413467000097","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Braunberger","original_name":"Pierre Braunberger","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b298893c3a36835c600040c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Marker","original_name":"Chris Marker","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/4hcLsvsYKcjx5oJJ0IshXK9L1l9.jpg","credit_id":"67982c36702f492f478f6808","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624784,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Odasso","original_name":"Christian Odasso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67982c69a6e41283f12b5403","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624783,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tony Daval","original_name":"Tony Daval","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67982c839ca029099c2b29aa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0063609","wikidata_id":"Q3212853","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiDCf9zgXMPOfJSq7zvpL92vIOm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1478},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEHJHScYqHkqvNU7wj0s77LCcwG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1478}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQbV5oLuZhQszZX7hf7gpJZPlJK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"1968-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
