It is based on the Russian war photographer Vladislav Mikosha’s diaries and photographs. He was filming at the front, but he also visited Hollywood during the war and became a star when he showed his pictures from the front. As Mikosha’s Swedish voice in “I stop time” we have Jonas Karlsson. Gunilla Bresky has made several award-winning documentary films about World War II. The most recent, “Night Witches”, is about female Soviet bomber pilots.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/lRNAY4GkTkJVfn9Idjw4GAWE2oQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3792,"logo_path":null,"name":"BOB Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":228,"logo_path":"/zT2bcTDEbBkfZi2APB8DYJKLIQ3.png","name":"Filmpool Nord","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":80086,"logo_path":"/ayx5AJqAMZNOSHPCZ1gx1ZiwX9Q.png","name":"Nordnorsk Filmsenter","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":33383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jabfilm","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story from World War II that is unlike anything else.","title":"I Stop Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Karlsson","original_name":"Jonas Karlsson","popularity":0.5427,"profile_path":"/t1sriOmD7FY7iPzXCL3boIVyo7r.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57e825039251412ae30146f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016590,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Blomgren","original_name":"Jan Blomgren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"531ba92592514177ab0045ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gunilla Bresky","original_name":"Gunilla Bresky","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/ueFadbgZyis5Ue9sCvlFhByKL4d.jpg","credit_id":"531ba95392514177b70045d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gunilla Bresky","original_name":"Gunilla Bresky","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/ueFadbgZyis5Ue9sCvlFhByKL4d.jpg","credit_id":"531ba90092514177b40046da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092654,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gunnar Källström","original_name":"Gunnar Källström","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5663996f9251412d7b00600f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684960,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fredrik Ydhag","original_name":"Fredrik Ydhag","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57e825cf925141298701575d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3671934","wikidata_id":"Q18747078","facebook_id":"jagstannartiden","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jn0XsgHr4HhhXTxn6nSIwgwee9I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lRNAY4GkTkJVfn9Idjw4GAWE2oQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":229579,"name":"vladislav mikosha"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bergen International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Göteborg International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
