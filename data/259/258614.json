He was a hero to millions, the saviour of cycling following the doping scandals which threatened to destroy the sport. However, less than six years later, aged just 34, he died alone, in a cheap hotel room, from acute cocaine poisoning. He had been an addict for five years. This is the story of the tragic battles fought by the most important Italian cyclist of his generation; man verses mountain, athlete verses addiction, Marco Pantani verses himself.","popularity":0.7505,"poster_path":"/ihZ4y3OwHzytzTY0K6MFo7ueFU4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7285,"logo_path":"/iwQvfvsz0cJ36xwmmfRhhrr7Riv.png","name":"New Black
