When first seen Adam appears to be in a rather morose mood in a chair. The weather is so hot that at the suggestion of the professor Adam removes his coat and gratefully accepts a fan. The question of dinner is then discussed and Adam focuses his attention on the bill of fare with all the interest of an epicure. A bottle of wine is shared by the two friends, the ape seeing to it that he gets his. After dinner a game of cards, followed by a pipe, with which we will leave him, although we have described only a few of his many accomplishments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Celebrated Ape, Adam II, Presented by Professeur DuBois","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3595494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1909-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
