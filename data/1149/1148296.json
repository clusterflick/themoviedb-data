She caresses their faces gently; a haunting melodic sound track plays. In another sequence, Weems— again dressed in black, but now in combat boots—walks through Rome’s Cinecittà. There, she meets a white man wearing a suit. He talks; she listens closely, then enfolds him in an embrace and engages in a slow, semi-erotic grind. But he is dull and stiff in her arms. It is clear Weems holds the power in this exchange; she shifts the paradigm of the seducer from male to female. From this scene she moves on, ascending staircases and wandering through corridors.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Italian Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2597849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Mae Weems","original_name":"Carrie Mae Weems","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a567be158c8500e24aa8a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148037,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dorothy Hindman","original_name":"Dorothy Hindman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a567eada10f000c593962c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
