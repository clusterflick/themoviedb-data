Sebas Saiz, campeón a contracorriente","overview":"The story of Sebas Saiz is that of an adventurous character who has broken stereotypes since his beginnings in basketball. The Madrid power forward, trained in the lower categories of Real Madrid and Estudiantes, soon decided that he wanted something different for himself than what was expected of his sports career. At the age of 17 he left for the United States, where he triumphed in the NCAA and became friends with actor Morgan Freeman. But his most groundbreaking decision came after he returned to Spain and spent two seasons in the ACB. He decided to go play in Japan when he was only 25 years old, moved by the impressive economic offer that came to him from Japan and with the well-being of his family as his number one priority. There, not only has he shown that he can grow as an elite athlete in an emerging league, but Sebas has become captain of the Spanish National Team and has been proclaimed champion of the last Eurobasket.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Informe Plus+.
