Voted best park in the world in 2012 and 2014 in the United States, the famous Vendée park continues to attract more and more visitors each year, and to develop internationally, with a new park in Spain, shows in Holland and soon in the United States. If the stories developed by Puy du Fou seduce, it is thanks to the emotions they convey, but also to the engineering treasures deployed by the teams. The teams do not hesitate to call upon the best talents in the aeronautical or automobile industries to guarantee the reliability and robustness of the mechanisms that contribute to making the park a global flagship of innovation in the service of the show.","popularity":0.2229,"poster_path":"/fJ3sNJP4AfVuoLt7mc4dMtyjkrS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74523,"logo_path":null,"name":"RMC Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":139669,"logo_path":"/9Fhvr0xOJxbrJ3JoiltfQwIJj1H.png","name":"RMC Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puy du Fou : le génie des spectacles révélé","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4150226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romain Clément","original_name":"Romain Clément","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a7339765c26c012df98f3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fJ3sNJP4AfVuoLt7mc4dMtyjkrS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":155582,"name":"amusement park"},{"id":158340,"name":"theme park"},{"id":279987,"name":"based on theme park ride"},{"id":293449,"name":"amusement parks"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
