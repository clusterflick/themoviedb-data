Founded in 2003 by lead singer and guitarist Arash Sobhani, Kiosk is Iran's most prominent underground rock band. At first, the musicians met in back alleys and basements around Tehran - in any little 'kiosk' beyond the regime's grasp. Their lyrics pry the skin off the Islamic Republic and hold up a mirror to the ghosts beneath. Kiosk has become the voice of the revolution. Not the holy war waged by clerics and politicians. But the revolt of the free mind against the boot-heel of tyranny.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiosk: A Generation Destroyed by Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2563070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
