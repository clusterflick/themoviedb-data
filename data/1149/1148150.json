Through interviews with Music Producer Harmony Samuels, Actor Oded Fehr, and Production Executive Damon Jones among others, Father Me enforces the conclusion that fathers are under-estimating just how important their role is in today’s world. Fatherlessness is one of our world's greatest social issues as 1 out of 3 children grow up without their biological father in their home. This generational pattern must be broken and it is Sheri’s hope that this documentary will help accomplish that — if it only repairs one relationship, it will have done its  job.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father ME","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4147547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheri Pedigo","original_name":"Sheri Pedigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64a4cc7b1bf26601241f8680","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4147549,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Oebel","original_name":"Paul Oebel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a4cd15158c8500e24a4e3c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4147551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheri Pedigo","original_name":"Sheri Pedigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a4ce588c44b900ae60186a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4147550,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sheri Padigo","original_name":"Sheri Padigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a4cd52da10f000fffe297c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IYC00468 100421 Sheri Pedigo.mp4","key":"614929407","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-26T03:55:20.000Z","id":"64a4cde3a0be2800aed526a9"}]}}}
