She chafes against their rules, and is also deeply disappointed when she doesn't get the part in the school play that she was expecting. She feels lonely and unimportant. A sympathetic adult from school helps her talk through her concerns, encouraging Susan to try to understand her parents' need to protect her. This adult also speaks with Susan's mother, and encourages tolerance of adolescent ups and downs, the importance of listening to one's child, and flexibility in household rules.","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":203547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herbert Kerkow Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":203548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mental Health Film Board","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell to Childhood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224066,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julian Roffman","original_name":"Julian Roffman","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":"/rYEPpF4hC1z9Zz2rMZqmnYZ9wZ6.jpg","credit_id":"64a5a27c158c8500ffba8ef3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joyce Henry","original_name":"Joyce Henry","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a5a290a0be2800aed5978c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0333438","wikidata_id":"Q123287778","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
