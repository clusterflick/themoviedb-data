Who decides what constitutes the news? How do they decide? And what about the men and women who report from the field. Are foreign correspondents allowed to tell all that they see? The film examines these complex issues by focusing on several international journalists in Nicaragua as they cover the negotiations surrounding the Arias Peace Plan in November 1987. With unprecedented access to the inner workings of ABC News, what follows is a unique portrait of a news crew in the field, as it interacts with the editorial process in the newsroom in New York City.","popularity":0.2156,"poster_path":"/5fGz6Nwi7qqjhHZJlAtqAMywEXL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World Is Watching","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4392637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Gray","original_name":"Elizabeth Gray","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"655f0a5a7dfda6011baeab55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Crooks","original_name":"Harold Crooks","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0a86244182014e87b249","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0a951dbc8800ad9ee3cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Crooks","original_name":"Harold Crooks","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0aae7dfda600ac212fc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0ab87dfda600fe657f5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Monro","original_name":"Jim Monro","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0ac71dbc88013be41ed6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4392638,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Doug Wilde","original_name":"Doug Wilde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0adc706e5600c4b98143","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706733,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Benson","original_name":"Robert Benson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f0b35706e5600e1519bdb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a70a5e957e6d00ff1c6512","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kramer","original_name":"John Kramer","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67783cba25e0e91c5774a763","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343449,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Duckworth","original_name":"Martin Duckworth","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798185609c252e3ab23f079","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dan Holmberg","original_name":"Dan Holmberg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679819325dc8b3b72d2ae3b1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3362499,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Bloom","original_name":"Jonathan Bloom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67981946372cb20cf8237b39","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5fGz6Nwi7qqjhHZJlAtqAMywEXL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
