Four characters dare to speak out publicly for the first time to recount the solidarity and support they found in this very special environment that has welcomed them: the Celtic circles. It's the story of a paradox, further proof that nothing is ever black and white. In Brittany's Celtic circles, with their outdated, conservative image of a fantasized society, homosexual men have for decades found a place of acceptance and tolerance. This is Gildas Sergent's milieu. Choreographer, sailor-cook who shares his cultural, social and jovial universe, and goes to meet these men who have dared to assert their singularity. They did so thanks to the tolerance they found in these folk groups. For many, sexual identity is no longer a taboo, or a source of shame. They can be role models, thinkers who make us reconsider our certainties and convictions. But there's still a long way to go before we're entitled to indifference.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/x2HuC1wqOx0QtCLfYp7tJFaB5EQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Et en plus ils dansent!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gildas Sergent","original_name":"Gildas Sergent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64a61118cae632013c6a8975","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692222,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Le Guennec","original_name":"Jonathan Le Guennec","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64a611210398ab00ebee769d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tristan Gloaguen","original_name":"Tristan Gloaguen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64a6112a07faa2011e02c2e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Jaouen","original_name":"Pascal Jaouen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64a611312b531d00c9a6c4f3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenan an Habask","original_name":"Kenan an Habask","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a610f1cae63200c87d4e25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3882771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Salvert","original_name":"Thierry Salvert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a610fa0398ab012d54102a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mqEgj6YwgNwJoOLnQ3RfShLmnZh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/x2HuC1wqOx0QtCLfYp7tJFaB5EQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
