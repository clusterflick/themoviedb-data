The production revolves around three great French composers who inspired NYCB founder George Balanchine: Charles Gounod, Maurice Ravel and Georges Bizet. The four ballets performed encapsulate Balanchine’s genius and his very own neo-classical style, they also provide a particular insight on the bonds that tied Balanchine to France. What is known today as Walpurgisnacht Ballet was a ballet choreographed for the opera Faust at the Paris Opera in 1975, it premiered as an independent piece in New York in 1980. Sonatine set to a music by Maurice Ravel, was created by two New York City Ballet's French principals, the recently departed Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux. La Valse was originally composed by Ravel for the Ballets Russes and Serge Diaghilev, then exiled in France, shortly before Balanchine entered the company. Symphony in C better known as Le Palais de Cristal, premiered at the Paris Opera.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/4xRbekWnPNRqUjPBcdzhIlMUr8w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York City Ballet in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2780452,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Capps","original_name":"Daniel Capps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6264be27202e1108adf417ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestre Prométhée","original_name":"Orchestre Prométhée","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6264be42e329430066d0d0ec","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11662474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4xRbekWnPNRqUjPBcdzhIlMUr8w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
