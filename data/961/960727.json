She was targeted specifically because she was a proud black lesbian, beloved in her home community of Khayelitsha Township, South Africa, and the latest victim in a national epidemic of homophobic violence. Funeka Soldaat and her activist group Free Gender in Khayelitsha took the police to court, alleging incompetence and corruption in Phelokazi's case. Ndodana-Breen and Greyson have crafted an operatic cine-poem inspired by Phelokazi's story, featuring vocals by mezzo-soprano Chantelle Grant.","popularity":0.0806,"poster_path":"/z77uNuy5s9AQBHrWDzNClaKddyt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greyzone","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariposa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Greyson","original_name":"John Greyson","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/eFxjwKtUOjRE6lKPIfD7ggZVk7K.jpg","credit_id":"625227fe8e2e000054e52f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2320978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick White","original_name":"Nick White","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aTsFcmFL0rfm0lxjJdGypMMjpE6.jpg","credit_id":"6252281067e0f70068b6e352","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500381,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bongani Ndodana-Breen","original_name":"Bongani Ndodana-Breen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62522876894ed600abc3b98b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z77uNuy5s9AQBHrWDzNClaKddyt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
