Once a child abandoned by the education system due to his unimpressive academic performance, LIN has redeemed himself in the modern pentathlon, an obscure sport in Taiwan. Now a coach, LIN tries his best to serve disadvantaged children who have a similar background to his own.  This year, he meets CHEN You-hsuan, a talented young girl from a remote village in eastern Taiwan. LIN devotes himself and all the resources he can find to train You-hsuan. If he manages to help You-hsuan qualify for the Olympic Games, he will have realized his dream of bringing Taiwan’s modern pentathlon team onto the international stage. But everything, including time, funding, the system, and the wayward adolescent, all seems to be going against his wishes.  But LIN never expected that this would be just the beginning of the cruelest and toughest challenge he has ever faced.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/Ahh0idqDCQ8GUQSF9DAShvBaxZH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Your Service","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"At Your Service","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Chia-hua","original_name":"Lee Chia-hua","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/b48psqvbRJWaX0ADpo0mIv40g1X.jpg","credit_id":"62510c23a1d3320064364d76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James C.
