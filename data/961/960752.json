One day I decided that I wanted to live with my father. I missed him too much. 10,000 km later a whole new life began for me, but my childhood memories didn't fade away. And, of all these memories, the memory of my yaya (grandmother) was always vivid. She raised me as if I was her own son, when none of my parents were ready to do that.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qa73havf8PiqGdt8vUOvnRCk8o4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2022-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now I Know Where to Find You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Berakha","original_name":"Diego Berakha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625242deab6849009be42250","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Berakha","original_name":"Diego Berakha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625242e891b5300050872d76","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Berakha","original_name":"Diego Berakha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625242f19d6e331d7a084ace","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Berakha","original_name":"Diego Berakha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625242fa894ed60054609ae5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Berakha","original_name":"Diego Berakha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6252430556b9f70066601d75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":819,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qa73havf8PiqGdt8vUOvnRCk8o4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":610}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente (BAFICI)","release_date":"2022-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
