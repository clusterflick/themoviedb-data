But in her thirties, Rose can no longer fall asleep at the side of her husband, who is imperturbably indifferent to her charms and neglects her, to develop, with more attentive ears, endless considerations on divine values in this world. So, in the evening, the young woman lets herself be drawn into pleasantly equivocal reveries. And if the day finds her repentant at the feet of her confessor, the night lurks again with its temptations and the virile torso of a handsome groom straight out of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", one of her clandestine reads.","popularity":0.1493,"poster_path":"/8xc1stukMI1gn0c4MMQJujTDKwJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25960,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Armorial","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunchild Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une femme au bout de la nuit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":282150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danièle Gégauff","original_name":"Danièle Gégauff","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/6AReYclhCyXl1PUHoTUuhZFAtDj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"6609f0ef60c51d0130e8989e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Luis de Vilallonga","original_name":"José Luis de Vilallonga","popularity":0.2008,"profile_path":"/bQyFSHrp6Cc06U9yw2UbRDK30GZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Xavier, the husband","credit_id":"6609f0f61d78f201858a51d0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Marquand","original_name":"Serge Marquand","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":"/fXEwlrbSTmBkz2tgKdxp1EXMkuS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The lover","credit_id":"6609f1024da3d401875b0c70","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35524,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Humbert Balsan","original_name":"Humbert Balsan","popularity":0.1805,"profile_path":"/a4MdpZJ8drWOuDGGtJyaJQ1TtVH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Xavier's disciple","credit_id":"6609f10a1f98d100c8b2cc1f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":11985,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Lifchitz","original_name":"Philippe Lifchitz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Abbot","credit_id":"6609f1151f98d10163b2e52a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":104271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Valiot","original_name":"Marianne Valiot","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The street fairy","credit_id":"6609f11b0bb076017c5bde69","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Bonzans","original_name":"Pierre Bonzans","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/43uXqxdHGBomvwpVeB0dDh0UiL1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Stranger in the elevator","credit_id":"6609f12662fcd3017ce05023","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelly Borgeaud","original_name":"Nelly Borgeaud","popularity":0.1836,"profile_path":"/kRp5lZ4yulhLGNxFVQecUYhJSLN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Rose's friend","credit_id":"6609f12d6f43ec0147a8e842","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1275588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Daërt","original_name":"Daniel Daërt","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6251ab14c7a7e000511e878b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1540127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Damiani","original_name":"Simon Damiani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6609f0da6f43ec0147a8e823","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1275588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Daërt","original_name":"Daniel Daërt","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6609f0e162fcd3017ce05000","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0341631","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8xc1stukMI1gn0c4MMQJujTDKwJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
