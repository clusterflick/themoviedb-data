I made this film at renowned experimental filmmaker Phil Hoffman's Film Farm workshop in Mount Forest, Ontario. Originally, I wanted to create a simple statement about overcoming depression. The ultra short narrative in 'Sisyphus' uses heartbreak as a metaphor for depression, since depression is just that - being heartbroken about life. The creative process and the practice of handmaking films speaks to treating life as a work in progress, thereby positively embracing the permanence of Sisyphus in my life. The lush, organic imagery in 'Sisyphus' was created by hand-processing 16mm black and white footage in a bucket and hand-tinting and toning individual pieces of film.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/bo5xYASZpfytgVn3GDwvJrlAZ90.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sisyphus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Bradley","original_name":"Maureen Bradley","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6252016eb6c26423b274d8c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bo5xYASZpfytgVn3GDwvJrlAZ90.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
