Throughout her short life, Gemma’s mother had fought with social services and the medical profession to get a diagnosis for the learning disability that Gemma so clearly had. Despite numerous assessments, the relevant authorities decided that she was able to live an independent life without any support. Powerless to intervene, and with no help from the authorities, Gemma’s family and friends could only stand by as, unknown to them, her five “friends” mistreated Gemma, leading to her brutal murder in the middle of the night. Almost a decade later, her friends and family are still struggling to come to terms with the killing – this is Gemma’s story.","popularity":0.1305,"poster_path":"/doxMAbvdODR0KD7LFz3LoWg03DO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":195631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hey Sonny Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gemma: My Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/doxMAbvdODR0KD7LFz3LoWg03DO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9826,"name":"murder"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"iplayer","release_date":"2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
