The curatorial team of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, crisscrossed the nation to find extraordinary contemporary art happening in unexpected places: the woods of North Carolina, the deserts of Nevada, the backstreets of Pittsburgh, the foothills of Arkansas, the riverbanks of New Orleans. The art and artists found by the Crystal Bridges team led to a groundbreaking exhibition of 227 works of contemporary art, many of which might otherwise have never been seen.","popularity":0.0703,"poster_path":"/qlnDjZ1bANV7TKuxn8Eh6W6dI2G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of the Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Renaud","original_name":"Brent Renaud","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/gb1YJKvzEd51tna0P6aN7xmZR3t.jpg","credit_id":"6250336ffd6300103f3677b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748265,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Craig Renaud","original_name":"Craig Renaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625033842f1be00f573dce87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10269674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":901,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qlnDjZ1bANV7TKuxn8Eh6W6dI2G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
