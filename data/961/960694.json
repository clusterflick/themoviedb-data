That is exactly what the Omidvar brothers from Tehran did back in 1954. Throwing their film-making kit on their bikes and with just $90 each to spend, they set out to see the most remote people they could possibly find. En route they created a visual record that is now a milestone in film history, a documentary record of a vanished world: peoples, cultures and even entire countries that no longer exist.  Abdullah Omidvar after emigration to Chile opened Arauco Films in Santiago, specializing in advertising and industrial films. Through it he released \"An Iranian in Latin America 1973\" with a Persian narration which was screened at Diana Cinema in Tehran.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/neO31JKVZZTLQG0MSwfWZORXN6d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Iranian in Latin America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2869264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdullah Omidvar","original_name":"Abdullah Omidvar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625209e78258fc046e471e0e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2869264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdullah Omidvar","original_name":"Abdullah Omidvar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625209bf9d6e331c5519925a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/neO31JKVZZTLQG0MSwfWZORXN6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
