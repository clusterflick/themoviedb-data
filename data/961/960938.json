Larger-than-life events like the pandemic, globalization, inequality, virtuality and climate change disturb the private spheres and public spaces. We are nomads, on the road to the next fata morgana, clinging on to the comfort of stories, collective events, and virtuality. Starting from personal explorations and departures, this short film creates an awareness of today's fading human sphere, attempting to make it more tangible and transparent.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/v29wvanjeS4R7nf2jVEcCDFIZL8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkentries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolaas Boucquey","original_name":"Nikolaas Boucquey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6252ff2a2f1be04a4efad98e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16347582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v29wvanjeS4R7nf2jVEcCDFIZL8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
