Whose? Sony dolls. Yes. It remains only to wait, just a little bit, for an eternity to be together forever, and not to see each other like this sometimes through the glass of a showcase... But what if Sonya leaves for another one without waiting for the cherished day? Everyone knows how easily the adult world can destroy children's plans, but in this story everything will happen the other way around.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sonya Loves, Sonya Does not Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3499085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalia Belyaeva","original_name":"Natalia Belyaeva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6250f45d67e0f700a3124bce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
