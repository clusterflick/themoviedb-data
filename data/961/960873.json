Having arrived at his father’s countryside estate from Tokyo to focus on preparing for his high school entrance exam, a lonely 15-year-old named Norio (Rairu Sugita) encounters three Sanka, first teenage Hana (Naru Komukai), then her father Shozo (Kiyohiko Shibukawa) and her grandmother. Taken under their wing and drawn to their simple and rugged lifestyle, Norio begins to spend his summer days fishing in the rivers and catching snakes in the bush for food. He also witnesses how they are discriminated against by people like his authoritarian father who rejects their illogical lifestyle. With bad blood already existing between Norio and his father, and a hopeless desire to become one with the Sanka, Norio is forced to confront the cruel reality of his age.","popularity":0.6867,"poster_path":"/cEOveaokX6u1DR11dPl9dpW22O1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanka: Nomads of the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"サンカ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2576903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rairu Sugita","original_name":"杉田雷麟","popularity":0.3475,"profile_path":"/5PLytRYSEpc4vDsqB1VJuNIxYm8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Norio","credit_id":"6252d5e367e0f739c19ab83d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2751263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naru Komukai","original_name":"Naru Komukai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hana","credit_id":"6252d5ee67e0f739c19ab8d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiyohiko Shibukawa","original_name":"渋川清彦","popularity":0.6069,"profile_path":"/eeQ3Dbrz7e09rJzcR31uxiH8xji.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shozo","credit_id":"6252d5fbab684906549328f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kisuke Iida","original_name":"飯田基祐","popularity":0.2997,"profile_path":"/iPz9FYCpT1XdUtBCE7qTiOD9dFx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6252d604447f9c0067b6e722","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shungicu Uchida","original_name":"内田春菊","popularity":0.4226,"profile_path":"/yULFUme9KfJPscwe9KJf5nrNRHS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6252d7b89d6e331d7a0a4519","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryohei Sasatani","original_name":"Ryohei Sasatani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6252d62a447f9c502a452968","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258163,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tomomi Kikuchi","original_name":"菊池智美","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acbc675c0e67e56bbb5fc6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1271,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cEOveaokX6u1DR11dPl9dpW22O1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Eiga-Sai Film Festival","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Osaka Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
