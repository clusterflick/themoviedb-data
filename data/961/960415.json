Traditional healers are shown collecting, preparing and administering herbal remedies that they have passed down from one generation to the next. Healers discuss where, why and how they gained their knowledge and why they choose to carry on age-old customs and practices despite the fact that Tonga is becoming a nation increasingly dependent on western medicine. Tonga's traditional healers are adapting to niches such as prenatal care and physical therapy. Interspersed throughout the film are beautiful scenes of water, agriculture, rainforest and people, all of which comprise current island life in the Kingdom of Tonga.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/xkswR3Gq0YVGfV72AjhnzGaCKAb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TO","name":"Tonga"}],"release_date":"1999-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tonga","iso_639_1":"to","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kau Faito'o: Traditional Healers of Tonga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melinda Ostraff","original_name":"Melinda Ostraff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6250dd198a84d2124b9c122f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xkswR3Gq0YVGfV72AjhnzGaCKAb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Women in the Director's Chair Film Festival","release_date":"1999-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
