Joël wants to experience a special day with his 15-year-old son Ethan and show him the upcoming solar eclipse at the same place where he once experienced it with his mother. Since the divorce, they rarely see each other and Ethan is also happy to finally have the opportunity to tell his father about his plans for the future.
