While Leon is dealing with the situation with exceptionally peaceful acceptance, his sister Mia tries her best to hide her pain and despair from her younger brother and does whatever it takes to make her brother happy in this difficult time.  Leon's illness reached a stage, where only a day outside the usual four walls is a great gift. The day the film depicts is one of them. Leon seems surprisingly vital after days of not being able to leave the house. Mia uses this opportunity to make some memories.  The short film invites on a journey of joy and pain, fun and grief. A little but big adventure giving insight into the cohesion of a loving family in difficult times.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
