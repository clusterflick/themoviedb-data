It ends with high-contrast photos with increasingly drastic color changes. This short film, inspired by Brakhage's Stellar film, was created by manipulating 1750 space photos in Photoshop along with grotesque paintings. Some frames contain black paintings by Francisco Goya, grotesque drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, grotesque engravings by William Blake. In order to refer to Brakhage's poetic style and understanding of storytelling in experimental cinema, two poems by Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch are placed in the beginning and end of the film.","popularity":0.1867,"poster_path":"/6PBqZtkVwAe9gfzeRSBYjUPajWr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2022-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"experimental cinema","title":"b.2402","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3497429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burak Batuhan Çağrıcı","original_name":"Burak Batuhan Çağrıcı","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624f5a7a156cc70434d404f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i38DfW1kiKVyZuC4s6kV9tLx4mm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PBqZtkVwAe9gfzeRSBYjUPajWr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
