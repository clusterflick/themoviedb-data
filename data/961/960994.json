The adolescents seem joyful, as though heading off on vacation, but their destination is in fact the funeral of one of their friends. During the journey, try as they might to avoid the subject and to hide their troubles, the unmentionable subject resurfaces in one way or another. For them, it is a question of facing the insurmountable, of remembering lovely things, of being rebellious, certainly, but also of learning to say farewell, or to at least come and \"pause in front of the other,\" before setting off again on their way.","popularity":0.0496,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9047050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
