The video includes photographs, voice, melodies and historical data, in a story that explores aspects such as the nature of memory, the human voice and identity. Through a cassette tape that he and his brother recorded to send to a third brother who was living in Russia, the work questions the meaning of the past and shows that collective and personal histories are inseparable and intertwined. Private and collective memories mingle in a collection of voices that bring together personal memory, political critique and philosophical reflection.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/3ZThEOoDXHof3VJw98YuYpuSqZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face A / Face B","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rabih Mroué","original_name":"Rabih Mroué","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6251d3718258fc0051b7efd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZThEOoDXHof3VJw98YuYpuSqZM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
