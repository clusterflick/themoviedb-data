On the soundtrack, Marcus tells a story while a single backlit photographic slide shows him lying on his back, the top of his head dominating the frame. The contrast between the still image and the momentum of the narrative emphasises the intimate exchange that takes place when a tale is shared. The scar on Marcus's head, Mc Queen says, 'is another story'.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":"/tAfndBb7Y4qp3zqf6cKkKBwwaSm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7th Nov.","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McQueen","original_name":"Steve McQueen","popularity":0.4663,"profile_path":"/if4tLIZJ0EJtyhlJaSzSwMQU5Yz.jpg","credit_id":"5e56eb329b86160018391c5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3327668","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tAfndBb7Y4qp3zqf6cKkKBwwaSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
