Initially, he was a klepht (bandit), then an armatolos (member of irregular forces), then a klepht again, until finally winding up in the Ottoman hangman’s noose. Captain Meϊtanos was described by monks who lived for many years after his death, recounting his activities and passing on his story. Memories are revived; snatches of a story and mystery emerge, such as that of a holy icon painted in 1715 by the iconographer Vaϊos – an icon which adds additional color and detail to this story.","popularity":0.1525,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/hDJO96mUfqtB9ia7ef7mEvguPxl.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1987-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captain Meitanos.
