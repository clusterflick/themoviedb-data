When his daughter brings a friend home to study,Manuel tries not to notice. Elena notices him,though,and makes no secret of it. Once his daughter leaves for work,Manuel is left to fight his temptations. It's not a fair fight.  After the break up, Abella and Markus are left to untangle their shared life together. They arrange to move their things out at different times but when they cross paths in the loft they still fall victim to the lingering attraction. \"We're not getting back together,\" Abella says firmly. \"I don't want to,\" Markus says, his hand already sliding in her pants.  Left alone with her friend's boyfriend, Ivy Lebelle wastes no time in aggressively seducing him. \"It's bold of you to do this in my girlfriend's house,\" he says,but doesn't bother to look away. She shrugs.\"Is it,\" she asks.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sQc9C64coZFq8mZoq4v9WK2cYKh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109873,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRENCHCOATx","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sun-Lit 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":932319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riley Reid","original_name":"Riley Reid","popularity":59.583,"profile_path":"/zoiTFst5e0TOFMigze2wxGSuJws.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c06ca93d25001751a216","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1426252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abella Danger","original_name":"Abella Danger","popularity":31.973,"profile_path":"/mlMkdE77iiZleX5ElIe6RtlX1yn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c07aa6d93100125b8703","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1864304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivy Lebelle","original_name":"Ivy Lebelle","popularity":14.997,"profile_path":"/6aqbzWytaU0GWn6j3Bh5TsdMzes.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c089a6d93100145ba4d3","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1866400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Koshka","original_name":"Elena Koshka","popularity":38.325,"profile_path":"/sJiHdi6X5symme3xKnQtrX9Zq3k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c098a6d93100145ba505","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":55680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Ferrara","original_name":"Manuel Ferrara","popularity":29.141,"profile_path":"/2nHXTVSNdY7Npr8oePXjMzfsycT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c0a74cbe120018ca6dbd","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1364651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isiah Maxwell","original_name":"Isiah Maxwell","popularity":9.021,"profile_path":"/6N539DK0cVvmqBk8SuXaMDkrc78.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c0b4f48b3400197737e5","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1301117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Nixon","original_name":"Tyler Nixon","popularity":6.405,"profile_path":"/wQk86OSNV6gbnULACSquI4U5TAK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c0c2a6d93100185bc3b8","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1344575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Dupree","original_name":"Markus Dupree","popularity":26.137,"profile_path":"/7Ni49TaehPieOATQDjSSvw56ZHJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5e56c0cf35811d00135d3332","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":132388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayden Kross","original_name":"Kayden Kross","popularity":224.15,"profile_path":"/8Z5x3ExVidqy79KWAQZosoOWjQT.jpg","credit_id":"5e56c0f59b8616001838dbe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1685,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gH9AOJcS2ZAlhQUW5zSCDlrLrf9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.689,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sQc9C64coZFq8mZoq4v9WK2cYKh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":517}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
