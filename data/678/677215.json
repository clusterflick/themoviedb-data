They have become friendly with the Wizard, and together with the woodman, the cowardly lion, and several new creations equally delightful, they journey through Oz -- the earthquake -- and into the glass city. The Scarecrow is elated to think he is going to get his brains at last and be like other men are; the Tin-Woodman is bent upon getting a heart, and the cowardly lion pleads with the great Oz for courage. All these are granted by his Highness. Dorothy picks the princess. -- The Dangerous Mangaboos. -- Into the black pit, and out again. We then see Jim, the cab horse, and myriads of pleasant surprises that hold and fascinate.","popularity":0.4114,"poster_path":"/1dnrJPx0KcHc2GFtiQQWGbU5tz3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Dorothy und Vogelscheuche in Oz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2306730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Moore","original_name":"Marcia Moore","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":"/gOfoJCsYK69vKiwzqt0yJOIyh2R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5e55ed6ea6d93100145a3439","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otis Turner","original_name":"Otis Turner","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e55edfe1e9225001b1fed03","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otis Turner","original_name":"Otis Turner","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e55edc8a6d93100185a3b68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
