Director Marc Gartman traveled with them on tour across the US and Europe, capturing not only Low's performances, but also quiet moments backstage and in transit between gigs.  Before one of their European shows, Alan is asked how the band would like to be introduced. He answers, \"slow...quiet...really nice people with a baby.\" This video document gives us a glimpse of the very real, understated folks behind the great minimal rock band.","popularity":0.3012,"poster_path":"/opMWew1sOdtpfsqVHVoSbgvV82e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closer Than That: A Documentary on Low","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Sparhawk","original_name":"Alan Sparhawk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"565ade21c3a36850660019e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1200255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Parker","original_name":"Mimi Parker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"565ade32c3a3685081001843","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1542246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zak Sally","original_name":"Zak Sally","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"565ade40c3a3685074001c39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Waters","original_name":"John Waters","popularity":1.5612,"profile_path":"/4foU1kJ24CJwz2RVZgyc7oxMs4i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"671e8484e833d92ef0608535","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Gartman","original_name":"Marc Gartman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565adfb99251416919001b16","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Gartman","original_name":"Marc Gartman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565ade039251416925001a0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cp9kkLDbDUMXA6deStMWZkACtnD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opMWew1sOdtpfsqVHVoSbgvV82e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Included with the CD/DVD set \"Low â€“ A Lifetime Of Temporary Relief (10 Years Of B-Sides & Rarities)\"","release_date":"2004-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
