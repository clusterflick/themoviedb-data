Due to their unsanitary conditions, sexual contact has become dangerous. Masturbation has become the paradigm of sexual experience and an array of low-tech devices with this purpose has come into existence.

Soon however, their relationship goes out of control.","popularity":0.3493,"poster_path":"/sHvIdDY4It8tdGOvxMDTq5ZjO64.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Traumfabrik","origin_country":""},{"id":69064,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Mer Ã  Boire Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":69065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avenida Films","origin_country":""},{"id":69066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blank Blank","origin_country":""},{"id":49104,"logo_path":"/ltAXIxwQQcAY5uc864bxPN14oph.png","name":"Studio Orlando","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cord","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1097134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura de Boer","original_name":"Laura de Boer","popularity":0.1595,"profile_path":"/vP4C5InLDbG4YUCLpj1JqMU6rHX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tanja","credit_id":"565d7ebd9251416dad00171e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schumacher","original_name":"Michael Schumacher","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/eliJlus5yIqMJ5mYrAIuMaEhzYH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Konrad","credit_id":"565d7ef4c3a3687cf700165e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Wewerka","original_name":"Christian Wewerka","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Czuperski","credit_id":"565d7f1b9251416da7001694","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543212,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nuria Manzaneda","original_name":"Nuria Manzaneda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565d7c52c3a3687cf10015bf","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543211,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Vasquez","original_name":"Carlos Vasquez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565d7c2ac3a3687cff001708","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543206,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pablo Gonzalez","original_name":"Pablo Gonzalez","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565d7bc3c3a3687ce7001749","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543206,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pablo Gonzalez","original_name":"Pablo Gonzalez","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565d7bd7c3a3687cff0016d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543209,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"C.S.
