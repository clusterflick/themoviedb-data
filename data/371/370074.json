Only the original copy of this film exists – it cannot be printed and is therefore projected only on rare occasions. As with other Le Grice films from the late 1960s, Spot the Microdot is marked by a radical rejection of ‘illusionism’, choosing to focus instead on the material properties of the film medium itself.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/rnv1MOe7ZgkntMdkyKrAZUnJnkN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An unprintable film, handmade by punching holes into an opaque 16mm strip.","title":"Spot the Microdot","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Le Grice","original_name":"Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/dXry25TyoLUpViu8Paqf6RMkDv7.jpg","credit_id":"5656b4d2c3a36819960084f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7323838","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9SJgBZS0rQsEerTS6ZylRszkGuQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rnv1MOe7ZgkntMdkyKrAZUnJnkN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Institute for Research in Art and Technology, London","release_date":"1969-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
