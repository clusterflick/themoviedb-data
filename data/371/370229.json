We decided to make a film. We had excellent wordless communication and had made several films together over the years. We decided on the following setup: I was to film, choose location and props, she would work with the material in front of the camera. I chose the Plaza de España in Seville and built a giant wheel. We had to hire a horse cart to get it there in four pieces and then assemble it in situ. Then we filmed it.
