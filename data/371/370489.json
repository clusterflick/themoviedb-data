An ethereal stage environment combining colored light panels, film projection, torn collage, hanging sacks of colored water, \"snow,\" crusted branches, rope, foil and foam was the set and setting in which an audience-activated electronic switching system controlled elements of the performance/installation. Images from film, slide and live action propel silent, ghostly performers to become aggressor and victim, torturer and tortured, lover and beloved, as well as simply themselves in this breakthrough mixed-media film performance. (The film Viet-Flakes is a central element).","popularity":0.1621,"poster_path":"/r8MBr5tpGPPDjRWrNHC8gPRHhO0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snows","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","credit_id":"565b3f59c3a3685079002e64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r8MBr5tpGPPDjRWrNHC8gPRHhO0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":837},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":865,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dDB5zkvwubyZoHCgCufHJMl2cDM.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":606},{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9uEf5VMRr0Fm6J5svQEglY3qeR3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
