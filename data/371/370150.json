Along the way, he encounters a farmer, a witch, a tin man, and a man who honors the dead. Working within the tradition of creative non-fiction, Invisible Girlfriend is a Southern tale that transcends literal interpretations of images in order to open up rich, loamy textures of humor and drama. The cinematography is startling in its intensity and violent beauty, representing an optical trope that offsets the desperate love that Charles sets off on his journey to find.","popularity":0.3371,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Girlfriend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Filhiol","original_name":"Charles Filhiol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"565735c5c3a368197000923b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Redmon","original_name":"David Redmon","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5657351e92514101910092ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":989375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ashley Sabin","original_name":"Ashley Sabin","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56573560925141019b00974b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337149","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
