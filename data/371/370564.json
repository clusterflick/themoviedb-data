It could have something to do with the lack of shopping days left on the calendar, but Howard is betting that his recent visit to a medical testing facility is more likely to blame. Before he can find out what he took and how to stop it, he'll need to go toe-to-toe, or fist-to-teeth, with every bloodlusting living thing between him and quiet spot to put a plan together.","popularity":0.1921,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Want Me Dead","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":966484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Conger","original_name":"Adam Conger","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Howard Phillips","credit_id":"565c4105c3a368507d0079db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Iseman","original_name":"Matt Iseman","popularity":0.2533,"profile_path":"/xdOA5gbPth7EYFlKKxHxpBcGjKU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"565c41069251416919007b5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin McCaffrey","original_name":"Justin McCaffrey","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Homeless man","credit_id":"565c4106c3a3685072007922","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1542712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Nunes","original_name":"Tony Nunes","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Teddy","credit_id":"565c410692514169280072f8","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1733677","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
