Confronted with the realization that his children knew very little about their origins, he became determined to pass down to them the customs and traditions of his ancestors. This film is the powerful biographical study of a 25-year span in Pete's life, from his early days as an oil-rig roughneck, rodeo rider and cowboy, to the present as an Indian concerned with preserving his tribe's spiritual heritage in the face of an energy-oriented industrial age.","popularity":0.3524,"poster_path":"/dYIByYtRzLuUt663GlWwYWyTrmq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standing Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Standing Alone","original_name":"Pete Standing Alone","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"582d2de2c3a3687730002e97","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Low","original_name":"Colin Low","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":"/nLNsXY9AzmjEfSoDXniMgwVGflJ.jpg","credit_id":"56e3f1f3c3a3685a9a002a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f300a410c811e9befa2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f306e72fe800b2053342","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie Howells","original_name":"Barrie Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wl9j33wHjYwssXlzwnlDwjyFBRX.jpg","credit_id":"63d2f30e5a07f500dc9e994d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499546,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bev Davidson","original_name":"Bev Davidson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f32e031a1d0083a07f02","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708228,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Hazanavicius","original_name":"Claude Hazanavicius","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f334cb71b8008102b861","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610995,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Knight","original_name":"John Knight","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f33c5a07f5009e97f1f7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Lamoureux","original_name":"Roger Lamoureux","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f344cb71b800d43a5e03","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":957757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldon Rathburn","original_name":"Eldon Rathburn","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f34d5a07f50082f3a45a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael J.F.
