Our nuclear legacy began with uranium. From 'Fat Man' and 'Little Boy' to 'Duck and Cover', we believed it was safe to eat, drink and breathe in the shadow of the atomic bomb. The subsequent health and environmental damage will take generations, and in some cases thousands of years to heal. Our ground water, wells, drinking water, air and soil are contaminated with some of the most toxic heavy metals known to man - and yet we still have no firm plan in place for the storage of tons of nuclear materials we continue to produce every year.","popularity":0.1436,"poster_path":"/58pkFxMr4lpQ9964SkKFAw67gFk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Flint","original_name":"Kevin Flint","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a70da925141692e0002a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Flint","original_name":"Kevin Flint","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a7139c3a368506d0002b9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lizabeth Rogers","original_name":"Lizabeth Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a70f6925141692e0002a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lizabeth Rogers","original_name":"Lizabeth Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a712f9251416920000290","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lizabeth Rogers","original_name":"Lizabeth Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a7154c3a36850790002bb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Flint","original_name":"Kevin Flint","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a70eb9251416920000280","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lizabeth Rogers","original_name":"Lizabeth Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a7112925141691b0002aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lizabeth Rogers","original_name":"Lizabeth Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565a70cf925141691e00026c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Donald C.
