Collectively this nine-hour essay explores circumstances of toxic contamination around the former US military bases in the Philippines as the locus for a meditation on historical amnesia, colonial privilege, and the consequences of unchecked militarism. Interweaving both cinéma-vérité and interview footage of Filipino victims and their families, environmental spokespersons, and community activists, along with early photographic material pertaining to the Philippine-American War, partisan songs, historical texts, and landscape photography, both ﬁlms are an attempt to construct a work capable of rendering some measure of this human and environmental tragedy and the complexities of its remedy.","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":277,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wake (Subic)","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Gianvito","original_name":"John Gianvito","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/2LrCskitAvdPuwqWvyv9pJXsLMX.jpg","credit_id":"565e8912c3a36874f4000bf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lav Diaz","original_name":"Lav Diaz","popularity":0.5557,"profile_path":"/p3XjMo6C30EKbtsutBZgXhkH0vD.jpg","credit_id":"56b97e50c3a3681e7d001692","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574723,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teofilo 'Boojie' Juatco","original_name":"Teofilo 'Boojie' Juatco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b97e7592514106a1001594","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bradford Krieger","original_name":"Bradford Krieger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b97e63c3a3681e6d001653","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5246586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
