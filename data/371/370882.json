She used his drawings as flats.The remarkably contemporary soundtrack for steel drum, guitar, flute, and voice was written for the occasion by Maya Deren's young husband, Teiji Ito, and is available in his album Music for Maya (Tzadik). Stan Brakhage called Dwightiana a pioneer example of the film portrait, abstract rather than narrative (the colored pencils represent Ripley's palette). Ripley was also a botanist, and Menken's unusual title alludes to botanical nomenclature as if Dwightiana might be the name of a species as well as a work \"about\" Dwight.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":"/5XHcKFn2c0sYMwfyPdukWHLBBWs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dwightiana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Menken","original_name":"Marie Menken","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/3LH6BrMX63UEWXLkliITRWuVcCC.jpg","credit_id":"565f52bbc3a36874fb00437b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":995589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teiji Ito","original_name":"Teiji Ito","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/a7wegTWlAg96XgMx1vH5hd6aJi4.jpg","credit_id":"5d53764f326c190015365f1f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2318262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5XHcKFn2c0sYMwfyPdukWHLBBWs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hKFPpikzbaXe7ATVnqAUYQJJmGA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"The Living Theatre, New York, N.Y.\t","release_date":"1959-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dwightiana 1959 by Marie Menken","key":"R5zaeyE_HLI","published_at":"2015-02-23T03:49:44.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"565f52ee9251416f07004465"}]}}}
