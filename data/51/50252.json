The prophet Daniel warned that in the last days, there would be a time of trouble such as never before. Were the tragic events of September 11 the realization of that prophecy? Is it possible that the ancients foresaw the wars, natural disasters and strife of the 21st Century? And what about the prophecies of others, such as Nostradamus and Father Malachi O'Morgain? Are End Time warnings just stories from the ancient past . . . or do they depict a grim view of our immediate future?","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/qmtjv1dTNhFiYrhh3Xq2ouel9ZH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are End Time Warnings True?","title":"Biblical End Times","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qmtjv1dTNhFiYrhh3Xq2ouel9ZH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
