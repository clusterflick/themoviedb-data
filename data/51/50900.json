Fred is an emotionally bankrupt westerner living amid his plush gardens and palm trees. Set against the backdrop of contemporary Marrakech, Raja is a cross-cultural drama about a wealthy middle-aged Frenchman's complex relationship with this poor local girl. Fred's attempts to seduce Raja, and their mutual attempts at manipulation, are fractured by their gross disparity of income, age and cultural sophistication.","popularity":0.3046,"poster_path":"/w92IsCXBuP1kqFZWBbK6FqeUfNF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gimages
