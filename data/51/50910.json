At Stan's suggestion Ollie then withdraws the couple's savings from the bank to pay for the furniture and inadvertently pays virtually the whole amount at an auction for a grandfather clock which is soon crushed under a passing truck. Mrs Hardy then unintentionally causes serious injuries to Ollie requiring him to be rushed to hospital for a blood transfusion. The doctor conscripts Stan to be the unwilling blood donor. Problems occur with the transfusion and when Stan and Ollie leave the hospital they appear to have morphed into each other.","popularity":0.7587,"poster_path":"/b9nqM7kwxKq0XHeWOpa8nIe91r6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thicker Than Water","video":false,"vote_average":7.228,"vote_count":46,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Dick und Doof mit der Kuckucksuhr","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Finanzgenies","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Dicker als Wasser","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Dick und Doof als Finanzgenies","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Dick und Doof - Zum Nachtisch weiche Birne","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zum Nachtisch weiche Birne","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"L'orologio antico","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Pi√π consistente dell'acqua","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Laurel","original_name":"Stan Laurel","popularity":0.5677,"profile_path":"/eT15ERUT5T3CVyf2a9JD1VAzC6q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"52fe47dbc3a36847f814bf51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ollie","credit_id":"52fe47dbc3a36847f814bf55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphne Pollard","original_name":"Daphne Pollard","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/gq00ghP1WTSkyBphFSvMQQ1ivGH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Daphne Hardy","credit_id":"52fe47dbc3a36847f814bf59","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Finlayson","original_name":"James Finlayson","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":"/mKzmqNW32JgFYICiQfEFK5m8b8s.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Auction Manager","credit_id":"52fe47dbc3a36847f814bf5d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bess Flowers","original_name":"Bess Flowers","popularity":0.4188,"profile_path":"/oErbIo6a2QPYZSqfdzU6vlDTD8i.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nurse (uncredited)","credit_id":"553736bac3a3683443007b0a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hall","original_name":"Charlie Hall","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/huLPhEhh8pO9v0gSJb7HVB76GRZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bank Teller (uncredited)","credit_id":"553736cd925141129b0012e0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Laurel","original_name":"Stan Laurel","popularity":0.5677,"profile_path":"/eT15ERUT5T3CVyf2a9JD1VAzC6q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47dbc3a36847f814bf4d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James W.
