When Jack is forced to leave Vegas, he packs up his old Cadillac and hits the road for Atlantic City. But his car dies in the desert and Jack is left stranded in the small town of Lost Springs. There, Jack meets jazz legend turned mechanic, Doc Bishop (Robert Guillaume), who helps him with his car trouble. Although Jack is far from the stage, he begins to find himself feeling at home in the small town. When he meets local bar owner, Lauren Wells (Melissa Joan Hart), Jack starts to see there is more to life than chasing fame and fortune. Doc encourages Jack to explore his true love of music, while Lauren provides the audience he has always wanted. But as Jack realizes this town has more to offer him than the bright lights of the big city, his Vegas past catches up with him -- what unfolds is comedy at the crossroads of life.","popularity":2.3985,"poster_path":"/fT60zzgWVZh8I1gNMVRryptucfE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His one man show is about to become a two part harmony.","title":"Satin","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Joan Hart","original_name":"Melissa Joan Hart","popularity":1.166,"profile_path":"/7ohLAH6mZ5fDwFMWJpZcwL6lQM6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lauren Wells","credit_id":"52fe47b6c3a36847f81441c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Guillaume","original_name":"Robert Guillaume","popularity":0.5902,"profile_path":"/prqxpeFeyyarRxxfaMHrqCKVyhV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Doc Bishop","credit_id":"52fe47b6c3a36847f81441cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alley Mills","original_name":"Alley Mills","popularity":0.4107,"profile_path":"/9MwgBLOpdaeIKcjUEV72f3S0StQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rose Wells","credit_id":"52fe47b6c3a36847f81441cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamilton von Watts","original_name":"Hamilton von Watts","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/zRa6OsXVjUD9wu77uRJgFYccaAZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack Satin","credit_id":"567485d592514179dd000785","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Debatin","original_name":"Jackie Debatin","popularity":0.3732,"profile_path":"/d8bcqagd0aBuKTJ73p3m4pEUMWf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Heaven Carrera","credit_id":"56748651c3a3681680000765","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Harrington","original_name":"Al Harrington","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/FepXr5LVYheBPiKUtka0ScSRIy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chief One Horn","credit_id":"63dbb8153dc313009df2701c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cudlitz","original_name":"Michael Cudlitz","popularity":1.1847,"profile_path":"/1snLOta9L2DAhmOTvNIn7OSxzQC.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kip Tanner","credit_id":"66034eda04733f014ae82c19","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Travis","original_name":"Stacey Travis","popularity":0.477,"profile_path":"/hVuilLYZlGkZFoAXQaNaCywaGih.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Rowanne Sexton","credit_id":"66034f1c459ad60187fc8076","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023503,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Aaron A.
