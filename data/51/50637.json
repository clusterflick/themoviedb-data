He takes a girl with him who has a brother already in prison. She has visited the prison twice in the month, so is not suppose to visit again. However when the group is completed the girl is included as well as Inspector Farrady. One of the clowns in the show is kidnapped and replaced by a con who wants to get even with two ex-partners. Boston Blackie figures out that a con has replaced one of his clowns but is unable to stop him. Blackie's clothes are stolen and a murder is committed. Of course, the Inspector immediately suspects Blackie of being involved. Now it is Blackie's job to find the killer, exonerate himself and help the girl free her brother.","popularity":1.6242,"poster_path":"/3E2eV6QzBerr0sn6cpNAaRv3eRb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blackie's got an eye-full of alibi... but cops don't believe in looks!","title":"Alias Boston Blackie","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester Morris","original_name":"Chester Morris","popularity":0.2935,"profile_path":"/fzWrhccpVX6UWBZjEutjvQ3qV92.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Boston Blackie","credit_id":"52fe47cfc3a36847f8149917","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele Mara","original_name":"Adele Mara","popularity":0.5853,"profile_path":"/l2qifL9nsEpwKmuy6HxVAYYWnBc.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Eve Sanders","credit_id":"587271b9c3a3684f16018f55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lane","original_name":"Richard Lane","popularity":0.2662,"profile_path":"/mzGnnilkdUC8Fzoq5z5GhhfV7yd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Inspector Farraday","credit_id":"52fe47cfc3a36847f814991b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George E.
