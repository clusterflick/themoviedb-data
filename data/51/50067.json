She communicates this information to her not-yet ex-husband and he, to prevent consummation of the invalid marriage rescues her by sending plumbers, waiters, porters, chambermaids, bellhops, desk clerks, exterminators and, finally, a crowd of roistering conventioneers to the suite to ensure no bedtime story would take place there","popularity":1.486,"poster_path":"/48hgDJAQ6Tlvqjm66gjtHDs1Nap.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14950,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.P.
