But song was the weapon of choice when, between 1986 and 1991, Estonians sought to free themselves from decades of Soviet occupation. During those years, hundreds of thousands gathered in public to sing forbidden patriotic songs and to rally for independence. \"The young people, without any political party, and without any politicians, just came together ... not only tens of thousands but hundreds of thousands ... to gather and to sing and to give this nation a new spirit,\" remarks Mart Laar, a Singing Revolution leader featured in the film and the first post-Soviet Prime Minister of Estonia. \"This was the idea of the Singing Revolution.\" James Tusty and Maureen Castle Tusty's \"The Singing Revolution\" tells the moving story of how the Estonian people peacefully regained their freedom--and helped topple an empire along the way.","popularity":0.362,"poster_path":"/qS3DK40XBP3WajlWLtGG2tOMvmi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6430,"logo_path":"/gzLZZOXccaIpJjl81N0zjK2WyF4.png","name":"Sky Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":107535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northern Lights Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2006-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A single nation.
