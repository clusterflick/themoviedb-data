Bringing his unique talents for observational comedy to DVD for the first time John's hotly anticipated Edinburgh Award Nominated show 'Elvis Has Left the Building' is tipped to be the next big thing. Filmed live at The Liverpool Empire, John's observations about coming to terms with middle age lead us through tales of his new found fame, his devotion to Liverpool FC, the positives of male grooming and an outlook on life that rings true for anyone and everyone.
