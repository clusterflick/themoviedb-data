As a cover for deserting the French army, he is given a job as a photographer. The group's leader, a Poujadist MP, tasks him with killing a Swiss radio journalist, Palivoda, a supporter of the Algerian cause. A friend introduces Bruno to a young girl who \"has the same kind of mouth as Leslie Caron\" and who wants to become a model, and bets him $50 that he will fall in love with her; shortly after introducing him to Véronica, an aspiring actress, he succeeds. The Little Soldier is Jean-Luc Godard's second feature film after Breathless, and it is Godard's first film with Anna Karina. Filmed in 1960, but not released until January 25, 1963 due to a censorship ban.","popularity":1.0951,"poster_path":"/pzKFKVZHeGhJQYWZN6qO3GXUApU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Georges de
