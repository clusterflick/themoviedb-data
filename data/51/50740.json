Suddenly, lightning strikes, and a vast crane above topples into the path of the oncoming bus... Then Big Ben begins to wind backwards. Time recedes. And we discover the lives of all the passengers and the events that brought them to that late-night bus journey, from the con-man with a hundred-pound cheque to the businessman's distraught and elderly wife. Time flows on, inevitably, to the crash -- and past it, as some live and some die.","popularity":0.8159,"poster_path":"/kFtTUV5GBDZZ9GrtOs1396IWqTi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gainsborough Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1933-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friday the Thirteenth","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessie Matthews","original_name":"Jessie Matthews","popularity":0.1414,"profile_path":"/u2UQL1K5ygDed8oPRzUywh1fYAS.jpg","cast_id":46,"character":"Millie","credit_id":"611111facd2046005f105409","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Richardson","original_name":"Ralph Richardson","popularity":0.3925,"profile_path":"/rPGUnz38kKtFfYmmEqVAjqZPA10.jpg","cast_id":47,"character":"Horace Dawes","credit_id":"61111212f04d01001f93ac76","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emlyn Williams","original_name":"Emlyn Williams","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/ri3bPiWWE4g3zEkinSuna34TNl3.jpg","cast_id":39,"character":"William Blake","credit_id":"61111160cd20460080e7ae39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Gwenn","original_name":"Edmund Gwenn","popularity":0.3929,"profile_path":"/9xUiHCycn0WsxqiqFjq2fI40FpQ.jpg","cast_id":36,"character":"Wakefield","credit_id":"61111123e635710048ea86a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Miller","original_name":"Max Miller","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/AdAnljCxo9DmILku2yo1Qihu9E3.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"611110140c27100047800b4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonnie Hale","original_name":"Sonnie Hale","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/c7dd8PWoHf1JjQXSmFcAdAH9SQX.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Alf, the Conductor","credit_id":"61110f7d255dba005deaced0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Smith","original_name":"Cyril Smith","popularity":0.2173,"profile_path":"/oa4qdqnGCsM7SETtH73bKqambT4.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Fred, the Driver","credit_id":"61110fb88d1b8e007275e78b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Aked","original_name":"Muriel Aked","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/m3eM4Cjhd1nCot32AxGzDc2J1uB.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Miss Twigg","credit_id":"61110fc7cd2046002e54bc8f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hulton","original_name":"Richard Hulton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"61110fdf4a52f8007e1cf4aa","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":608601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Drayton","original_name":"Alfred Drayton","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/sZU7u2o4osLvOE2PA6PjekpBnXc.jpg","cast_id":29,"character":"The Detective","credit_id":"61111026f04d010072f4f156","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hartley Power","original_name":"Hartley Power","popularity":0.149,"profile_path":"/q4v37vnq4iqkTkvzpBfLQeUjd6c.jpg","cast_id":30,"character":"American #1","credit_id":"6111103601e4d10048a3ff03","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percy Parsons","original_name":"Percy Parsons","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":31,"character":"American #2","credit_id":"611110450b5fd60074e553c5","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliot Makeham","original_name":"Eliot Makeham","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/5px5MdbwSOP8mLueHksTTguEmW2.jpg","cast_id":32,"character":"Henry Jackson","credit_id":"611110710c2710005e582c70","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Jeans","original_name":"Ursula Jeans","popularity":0.2795,"profile_path":"/2Xlw0iFO71velFVUia0BPw1LkG3.jpg","cast_id":33,"character":"Eileen Jackson","credit_id":"611110858d1b8e0046e8cad3","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.A.
