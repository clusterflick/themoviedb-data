However, he is a lot more hard-working than all the others as he wants to get away from this besieged city. Apart from his study, he is indifferent to everything because he comes from a defunct family. Having to take care of his mentally-ill mother, Ling Kit is also forced to face his Dad – a heavy drunker and a heavy gambler. His younger brother Chun-Kit has left the family for years. At that time, Chun-Kit was heavily bullied by his classmates in school and he was always beaten by his drunken father. Being the elder brother, however, Ling-Kit did not protect Chun-Kit from being beaten so Chun-Kit left in great panic.","popularity":0.1974,"poster_path":"/oItfP5tdCwH5HrydEQZPbgwD6MY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3615,"logo_path":null,"name":"BIG Pictures","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2008-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Besieged City","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Wai sing","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"圍城(2005)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tang Tak-Po","original_name":"Tang Tak-Po","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6479b932cf4b8b01418e5ac2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1098628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dada Chan","original_name":"陳靜","popularity":1.4333,"profile_path":"/fYjLgWBiQOaFlIe3FYFhybRAB8L.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4f9117caaca20035f9e2a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joman Chiang","original_name":"蔣祖曼","popularity":0.3583,"profile_path":"/1bBYbkZwIP0RFD1w6RGdySChv0c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4f914da5743d00368c619f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1619791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Lee Yat-Sing","original_name":"Jonathan Lee Yat-Sing","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/596ElX4PAxa5m2uu1QIfitFzY47.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4f91609b8616003440a4b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Ho-Yin Wong","original_name":"黃浩然","popularity":1.0721,"profile_path":"/wrs7gHK5Ykyae2okZbrQU9bgIKN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6479b86793828e011623a7e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yatho Wong Yat-Ho","original_name":"Yatho Wong","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":"/5yx8IvMj0VN7gs2Tjvf3uDQRYSk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6479b9610e29a200a65f984d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Chan Cheuk-Kei","original_name":"Keith Chan Cheuk-Kei","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Keith","credit_id":"64aa8f6f9c97bd00ff1b468b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Cheung Moon-Yuen","original_name":"Kenneth Cheung Moon-Yuen","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/fVhZCWJ2mbGWpPrZW8KmsiPUY2R.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64c245601cfe3a0eb282e555","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Chan Kwok-San","original_name":"陳國新","popularity":1.0678,"profile_path":"/wW90J7wyACpndFPgwq5TFtyKHaO.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65e510ddfe077a018511bbf3","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Ah Mon","original_name":"Lawrence Ah Mon","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/tz66iTJyva30OSt5BeUV0g98YHF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47bbc3a36847f81454c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200187,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kom Chun-Yu","original_name":"Kom Chun-Yu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf6bb185090f0125bcc6e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kam Loi-Kwan","original_name":"Kam Loi-Kwan","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/nzMcwrZxN1qlBDT5NiK4ZPxojs9.jpg","credit_id":"68041b45e506a8e3a0ad952b","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1210844","wikidata_id":"Q4896285","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":773,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/oItfP5tdCwH5HrydEQZPbgwD6MY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
