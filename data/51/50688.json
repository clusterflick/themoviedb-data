Captain Labesch arrives from the mainland, determined to crack down on the island's lawlessness and clean up the ineffectual, hard-drinking police force. He appeals for assistance from wealthy plantation tycoon Carl Van Molder, who owns nearly half of the island and wields a great deal of influence over the population. Van Molder has made the study of parapsychology his life's work and believes in the secret powers of the mind. He warns Labesch not to interfere with this forgotten island's ancient ways. Also visiting is Van Molder's niece, Annabella, a temperance crusader who wants her uncle to help fund the International Anti-Saloon League. She falls in love with handsome police lieutenant Andrew Wilhelm","popularity":0.9928,"poster_path":"/me3KWsJkzNjdgWzdcJgFB6lfiCX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17786,"logo_path":null,"name":"Azteca Films","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1971-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isle of the Snake People","video":false,"vote_average":3.1,"vote_count":30,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Isle of the Living Dead","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Snake People","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Isla de los muertos","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Gli adoratori della morte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Cult of the Dead","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Cult of the Dead","type":"Video"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Snake People","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Cult Of The Dead","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Karloff","original_name":"Boris Karloff","popularity":0.7586,"profile_path":"/fVi0QkiziavXB8HnWk5NzRcnCO1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carl van Molder / Damballah","credit_id":"52fe47d2c3a36847f814a04d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julissa","original_name":"Julissa","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/ma0lz2CHIke3ADexWBzYTtg6S5T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anabella Vandenberg","credit_id":"52fe47d2c3a36847f814a051","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos East","original_name":"Carlos East","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":"/szMIoQsEGYUuy8cAv7i1A2mXGhz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lt.
