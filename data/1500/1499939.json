In the span of a few short months, the young composer produced Les Pêcheurs de Perles (The Pearl Fishers), which premiered on September 30, 1863. Nearly 150 years later, the work returned to the Opéra-Comique! In Yoshi Oïda's splendid staging with Fabrice Kebour's bold lighting, soloists and dancers shine brightly in this early gem by the great Bizet.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wsQtrpDkWKsnEUhN4yT1wMj3j2J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bizet's The Pearl Fishers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Yoncheva","original_name":"Sonya Yoncheva","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/7KgfzEZluTl9HIQBqwHaew4WJRA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Leïla, a priestess of Brahma","credit_id":"6851edd5b745165345ec9618","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Korchak","original_name":"Dmitry Korchak","popularity":0.1467,"profile_path":"/rqdJ7SmDU3hv0SitHW6FIkpXC8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nadir","credit_id":"6851ede1b745165345ec961c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Heyboer","original_name":"André Heyboer","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Zurga","credit_id":"6851edee655a91782a92e041","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Testé","original_name":"Nicolas Testé","popularity":0.1706,"profile_path":"/mcoVupW6YTQbZ2aR9xDmWrLo7I9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nourabad","credit_id":"6851ee015a0733761d87b981","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshi Oïda","original_name":"Yoshi Oïda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851ed963aa2f5cea86aed5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Roussillon","original_name":"François Roussillon","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851edab662e4cee015ea57f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Hussain","original_name":"Leo Hussain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851edc33d8f1f65705ea5ec","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5568120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wsQtrpDkWKsnEUhN4yT1wMj3j2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
