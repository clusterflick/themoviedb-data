The film centers on the Gwangju Uprising that occurred in South Korea in May 1980.  The Gwangju Uprising saw the Chun Doo-hwan regime declare martial law and violently suppress student and citizen protests, resulting in many casualties. Tomiyama responded immediately to the tragedy by organizing a traveling exhibition featuring her print series Prayer for the Fallen. Moved by Tomiyama’s intense anger toward the dictatorship and her deep mourning for the victims, Maeda created this film in 1981. Combining news footage that documents the reality of the events with Tomiyama’s print works—unfolding like shadow play—the film powerfully conveys the nature of state violence and human sacrifice. The music was composed by pianist and composer Yuji Takahashi.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/ilD9NA5f9yuTD221sOIPytmIhBG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Gwangju, May 1980","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Free Gwangju, May 1980","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Jiyu Koshu: 1980 nen 5 gatsu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3782010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taeko Tomiyama","original_name":"Tomiyama Taeko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"68517c80d23ca0451d92de91","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2293921,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katsuhiro Maeda","original_name":"Katsuhiro Maeda","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68517bf444c266df42065d87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1517986,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yuji Takahashi","original_name":"高橋悠治","popularity":0.1913,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68517c5f44c266df42065d91","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/ilD9NA5f9yuTD221sOIPytmIhBG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/dl3apFM9Y71jfH8TwCkJ7QuIaAw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
