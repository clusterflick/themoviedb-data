She's heard that he shot a Gucci campaign and is on the hunt for potential contacts. He is pursuing a more artistic collaboration, focused on reinterpreting Joan of Arcâ€™s suffering. Neither seems capable of getting what they want. As the camera flashes, the tension and humour that underly two worlds that fail to communicate are exposed for all to see. Both photographer and subject are forced to face each other as well as their own desires, in a situation that oscillates from sincere, to sinister, to slightly absurd... And then, very real.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hundred Bucks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
