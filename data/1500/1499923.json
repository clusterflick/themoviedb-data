In the autumn of 1922, while walking in the Forest of Fontainebleau, he comes across an incredibly beautiful woman named Sharon Kazatti. Soon joined by ladies and gentlemen coming out of a soiree, she slips away out of his sight. Claude utters in spite of himself that she is a woman of sublime beauty. Hearing Claude's exclamation, a young man tells Claude that she is only a mannequin, not worthy of his praise and belonging to a world other than his. The young man's name is Louis Valentin and he is a gigolo. It seems that Louis cares for Sharon as well. Claude denies Louis's assertion, saying that she also has a soul just like him. A strange kinship grows between the two as they find that they both are attracted to the same woman. They decide to fairly compete to win Sharon's heart.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bx1iRyHBy6igOyyS4P9N6anBgti.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Amber-Hued Rain / Je t’aime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashio Tomoe","original_name":"Takashio Tomoe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Duc Claude de Bernard","credit_id":"6851e08cb717883dc50660b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wakaba Hiromi","original_name":"Wakaba Hiromi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sharon Kazatti","credit_id":"6851e09af460b7f0f6c4168c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4091796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ooura Mizuki","original_name":"Ooura Mizuki","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Louis Valentin","credit_id":"6851e0ae20d0adcb3b87b967","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akishino Miho","original_name":"Akishino Miho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Francoise de Plaire","credit_id":"6851e0bdfb25f80e0cbbda07","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shibata Yukihiro","original_name":"Shibata Yukihiro","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851e0de5aa51a655cb6e1b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Okada Keiji","original_name":"Okada Keiji","popularity":0.1669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851e0ecec44a876576aece3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVyuSU5uvJv0Qv8SJQYoVWSqW5O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bx1iRyHBy6igOyyS4P9N6anBgti.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
