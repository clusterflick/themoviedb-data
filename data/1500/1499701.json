At 900 meters above sea level, two spots of snow, nestled between the rocks, survived the summer. They hold the image in tension between stillness and transition, as they remain fixed in spite of the rain and the wind that cause ripples on the water below. The snow-spots reach to the past and future and somehow cease to belong in our present. The work echoes the landscapes of Romantic Painting.  The photograph was taken in the winter in the same location from the same position. Possibly the two spots of snow in the film are left over from this winter landscape or they are covered with snow in the photograph and might reappear next season.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"survivors at the lake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A K Dolven","original_name":"A K Dolven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68517c4744c266df42065d8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
