hypocrisy and family disintegration, as well as dismissing his class.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/szR4lMEMz9JQh55QaoEwQxJUYZn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viktor,
