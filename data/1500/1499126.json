When she moves to a new city to explore her queerness, these internal tensions erupt into a psychological dissonance — between who she was taught to be and who she is becoming.  Told in two parts — a narrative section with no scripted dialogue, and a documentary-style epilogue — the film uses movement, ambient sound, and visual symbolism to reflect the inner world of its protagonist. Dissonance ultimately reveals the emotional complexity and quiet resilience of many queer people seeking safety, freedom, and belonging in unfamiliar spaces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissonance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adéráyọ̀ Adenekan","original_name":"Adéráyọ̀ Adenekan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685004e61fbdd9fa2fbb55cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
