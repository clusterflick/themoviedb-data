A roll of 35mm film captures these four minutes in which the warm light changes into white. A naked figure, appears limbless, as it sits on the edge of a large boulder facing the sea. This body is sculptural in its motionless, its humanity betrayed only by its breathing. The gradual changing of light, the slow movement of the water, and the handbag that marks the highly contemporary moment, all subvert the apparent timelessness and otherworldliness of the image.This project was made in 2002 in the south of Norway.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"between the morning and the handbag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A K Dolven","original_name":"A K Dolven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851852daa700ca352b31439","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
