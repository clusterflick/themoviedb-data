A group of teenagers begin receiving cryptic, threatening messages from an unknown caller — who seems to be watching their every move. When one of them turns up dead, the tension explodes into violence, and what begins as a prank spirals into a full-blown killing spree.  As the body count rises, secrets unravel, and the surviving characters must figure out who the killer is — before the next call comes through.","popularity":0.4929,"poster_path":"/iuEITZQApKn1Rdp9W7vtFm4PPgY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
