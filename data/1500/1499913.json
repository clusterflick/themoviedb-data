Set against a comic backdrop, the film explores their youthful highs and lows, friendships, and formative experiences. Years later, the same group reconnects through a WhatsApp group called `GT` and begins meeting annually after 24 years. Through a non-linear narrative, the film blends nostalgia, contributions from old classmates, and current social issues, all converging around a significant personal dilemma faced by one of them. A blend of fiction and reality, this bio-fictional tale reflects on time, change, and enduring bonds.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PDC Athra Cheriya Degree Alla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
