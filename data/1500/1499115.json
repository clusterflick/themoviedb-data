Disappointment paralyzes her thoughts, and she decides to write her greatest and final work — a farewell letter — to prove to everyone what she’s truly capable of. But there’s one problem: Marta can’t write.  In search of inspiration, she goes to the city library to find a rare book about the last letters of great writers. There, she learns that the book has long been overdue — it’s still held by an unknown reader. Following the clues, Marta sets off to find this person, hoping the book will help her overcome her creative crisis.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/r97rWISE27gEmemzuShWt0CPRHL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Goldstein Youth Village","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"When words fail, the search for them becomes the story.","title":"The Last Letter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Последнее письмо","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"המכתב האחרון","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508258,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sofia Gubarev","original_name":"Sofia Gubarev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Martha","credit_id":"684ffded4cff3224bc1ecdfe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonya Klyatis","original_name":"Tonya Klyatis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Librarian","credit_id":"684ffe25bbfe31cc90295311","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5479316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Pakhomov","original_name":"Ivan Pakhomov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Male","credit_id":"684ffe5e93360e5c985c8375","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artemy Belogolovsky","original_name":"Artemy Belogolovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Pianist","credit_id":"684ffe8e4490128c133fedf1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Reichel","original_name":"Michael Reichel","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":"/38WNJHVm8WMQ583EAIDxTEXiK1n.jpg","credit_id":"684ffc0d80ad301196295420","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508258,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sofia Gubarev","original_name":"Sofia Gubarev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ffcef65bf58234d3fed49","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Reichel","original_name":"Michael Reichel","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":"/38WNJHVm8WMQ583EAIDxTEXiK1n.jpg","credit_id":"684ffd01f9743db94b3fec3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508265,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arina Stepanyuk","original_name":"Arina Stepanyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ffd6f5d0fcf77305c82cb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Reichel","original_name":"Michael Reichel","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":"/38WNJHVm8WMQ583EAIDxTEXiK1n.jpg","credit_id":"684ffd88d1d0dbe543b0e6c8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5508267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sofia Kogan","original_name":"Sofia Kogan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ffda04ef4c4bee6295338","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5VXclYvHTVtrDjJKpMS5RMExZkp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1810},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1001,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kp5UIKGXqLZKuIWsxhJ2SDJEsYL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":982,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wU8gGLULM12YWzXwlMWkHwDRSCR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1746}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r97rWISE27gEmemzuShWt0CPRHL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":353166,"name":"michael reichel"},{"id":353627,"name":"the last letter israel 2025"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
