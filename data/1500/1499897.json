The only trouble is that it only works with his nine-year-old son Conor, whom it transforms into SIROCCO 9. Now Earth is under threat from a particularly nasty breed of aliens led by Commander Thex and there is also the problem of SPOOK, a criminal organisation based in Cuandra Luba, who are bent on world domination. The only solution is to launch SIROCCO 9 in a thrilling and fast paced all-out action attack and Conor O'Connor is more than up for the task. STAND BY FOR ACTION!!!!. SIROCCO 9 is dedicated to the memory of Sylvia (Thunderbirds) Anderson (1927-2016) a most gracious lady and a good friend, also for my friend Lenny Jones the voice of Joe 90.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uX6REZNSEz9HLaJT9050qsdRRAJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonrise Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirocco 9","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reid Anderson","original_name":"Reid Anderson","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":"/jL74svnCcJyfEEnZqxccGWb99Ht.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Professor Liam O'Connor (voice)","credit_id":"6851d6fd28d62ca2ff87b938","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2008596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabienne Piolini-Castle","original_name":"Fabienne Piolini-Castle","popularity":0.1916,"profile_path":"/1RMLidE8FkDSUSBA2xcirzpq2ll.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Connor O'Connor","credit_id":"6851d711e7cd4b6a0692e01b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5067440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Dooley","original_name":"James Dooley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6851d7278607df33e787b93d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Washington","original_name":"Hank Washington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6851d734631f89e996b6e244","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Fitzgerald","original_name":"Patrick Fitzgerald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6851d7448bb25feb84ec95f6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Morgan","original_name":"Michael Morgan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6851d761ce8654cdb7065f94","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James McIlroy","original_name":"James McIlroy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851d63120d0adcb3b87b938","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Fitzgerald","original_name":"Patrick Fitzgerald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851d65a870cdbd91d5ea631","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James McIlroy","original_name":"James McIlroy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851d68f0ec330016292e03c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511357,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"PJ Cormack","original_name":"PJ Cormack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851d6a91b5340de1be7bb2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6230948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":805,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uX6REZNSEz9HLaJT9050qsdRRAJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
