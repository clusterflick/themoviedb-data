One day, not only does he meet a newcomer at the company, Michelle Jenkins (Rachel Lee), but he also accidentally stumbles into Ryan Collins (Gamebox), a person who acts and even dresses similarly to him. The two guys don't get along quite well, and as a result, they get tangled up in the middle of a very discretely secret propaganda led by the corporation's boss Jonathan Davis (RedRageKnight) as they end up lost far from home. Now, it is up for the two guys to find a way to get back to Crateville before it's too late.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/pdlEPbG3bYUCr0xcDR8i80Z4YZL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dozer Daisy Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":265487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Element-M","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2027-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"These guys are in for a wild ride.","title":"Guys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Max & Ryan","type":"Alternative English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5509225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Traylor","original_name":"Tony Traylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Max Anderson (voice)","credit_id":"6850810d4909cd57e8377d90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5509226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gamebox","original_name":"Gamebox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ryan Collins (voice)","credit_id":"68508116895e0eb997150ba0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5509229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Lee","original_name":"Rachel Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Michelle Jenkins (voice)","credit_id":"6850815f6844cee5ad99bd5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5509230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"RedRageKnight","original_name":"RedRageKnight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jonathan Davis (voice)","credit_id":"6850816f621fe78225f790aa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5509231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam A.
