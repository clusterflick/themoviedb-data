Their story centres connectivity, the sweetness of feeling and how small actions can build a picture that is overwhelmingly big and increasingly mythical. Uncertainty courses through its veins but here it breathes. This film is made up of the hours of VHS footage that couldn't make it into the 30-minute-long film Fitting Room that will follow it. Here we will see Callum and Imani return, in a few months after the world of Nothing Belongs To Me Alone ends. Its title is borrowed from a poem I wrote. The documentary aspects also capture the filming of Fitting Room and allow the relationship between these two people to play amongst reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/62XSKl0jTdx7MIO2jx9pM2JD4a8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing Belongs To Me Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamidha Awshan","original_name":"Hamidha Awshan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Imani","credit_id":"6851cad5d7e8cdf140c4165b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Gubbins","original_name":"Jack Gubbins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Callum","credit_id":"6851cae3f9fa08f092bbd961","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saskia Leigh Martić","original_name":"Saskia Leigh Martić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851cb4c67cc3ac40792dff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500649,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yusef Tothill","original_name":"Yusef Tothill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851cb8c73352bfca35ea5a1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saskia Leigh Martić","original_name":"Saskia Leigh Martić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851cb9cd2dcfe9d57b31521","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saskia Leigh Martić","original_name":"Saskia Leigh Martić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851cbaa971abd7a49c41683","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62XSKl0jTdx7MIO2jx9pM2JD4a8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
