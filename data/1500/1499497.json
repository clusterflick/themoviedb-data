One day, escaping from thieves, he hides inside a shed, unaware that Germonio, a man who, it turns out, locked himself inside more than ten years ago and no one has seen him come out, lives there. Juan and Germonio, due to their ages, are very different, but they have more in common than they think. A blue flower, a candle that won't light, and a journey to the depths of their soul are fundamental elements that weave this story together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tzFuPRoi7e76PvTy206dM45Xpxk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265511,"logo_path":null,"name":"PAS
