The soundtrack, loud and distressing, is that of a cacophony of screaming birds. The camera is fixed on two women that stand facing a foreboding landscape. Their heads, one blonde one brunette, fill the lower bottom corners of the image. Like book ends they frame the mountainous cliff that towers above them. As the fog gradually lifts more and more birds are revealed flying in and out of the cleft of the rock face.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"moving mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A K Dolven","original_name":"A K Dolven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68517b3f3c4c614816b3135a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
