After a shipwreck, a Sim regains consciousness on a remote tropical island with no memory of how he got there. He begins to gather supplies, search for shelter, and attempt to send signals for help. But as time passes, eerie signs begin to emerge — strange carvings in the rocks, whispers in the jungle, and footsteps that don't belong to him.  As his grip on reality begins to slip, the Sim must face the possibility that the island isn’t uninhabited — and that something is watching him.","popularity":0.8643,"poster_path":"/uLYbd0cDcHJZsOgZAZWcduewI1O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stranded","video":false,"vote_average":7.25,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Chambers","original_name":"Zachary Chambers","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/xjcly5OB0V8awGRIUQUCdv3i09G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Castaway","credit_id":"6851d1c2aeba2d2fe4b31554","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5140898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","original_name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Presence","credit_id":"6851d1d49ed29ab570ec9530","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Voice","credit_id":"6851d1e45a0733761d87b931","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6851d2145e0a818692efa8f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6851d21fe730af4542efa928","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6851d22ce1f49bfb8592e0aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6851d236b745165345ec9599","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6851d23dbc97992f45b6e1fa","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6851d247298ead0ca9bbd9dd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"6851d2565a3cdf4b1d065edc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harley Coleman","original_name":"Harley Coleman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851d268a9df792dcbc416ab","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Director of Previsualization"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Gordon","original_name":"Matthew Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6851d2885e0a818692efa8fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uLYbd0cDcHJZsOgZAZWcduewI1O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9743,"name":"stranded"},{"id":33711,"name":"entity"},{"id":155746,"name":"deserted island"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":341359,"name":"the sims"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
