The film takes advantage of the site under transformation to stage two things. The first is the lucid and harsh testimony of Ramón Barreiro, struck by AIDS in the early eighties and a survivor after many years of struggle and serious aftereffects. The second, a series of dialogues taken from the four Gospels, in which elderly members of the LGTBIQ+ community cite “the old words anew and in a new way”, as one of the notices which can be read at the beginning of the film states. Provocation is by no means the primary intention behind showing them; nor are they composed of irony. Rather, the film understands that the biblical text, as the basis for rituals and stories shared by generations, is a vast framework or grand code which can be harnessed dramatically.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2WWogwTqqH94ITITtEnaSRTDQid.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greater Gospel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Codesal","original_name":"Javier Codesal","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622b7d8202576400464530cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Codesal","original_name":"Javier Codesal","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622b7d98b34409006e82db3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"julia Sueiro","original_name":"julia Sueiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622b7dad12c604004618f067","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1661,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vlrf4qOSbe56hpKKG5YzEnTPSk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2953},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/eeckPynzi36aPXZrqgaADYJoASo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/2WWogwTqqH94ITITtEnaSRTDQid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
