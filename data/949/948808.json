He ends up in the Ghetto and meets Ringo (Garfield Reid), who wastes no time in \"\"terrorizing\"\" him for money. Shebada absorbs the bullying for a time, and later discovers that he has found himself in a tenement mess with the kind of excitement that he could do without. Ringo's influence on Shebada ran deep and, in the end, he gets a taste of his own cooking. Shebada Come to Town is a comedy of transformation. Just as Shebada leaves his rural place of abode, which has wide differences with where he now calls home, his life is significantly transformed and he becomes a new person.
