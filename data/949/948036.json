Neither her dress nor her blood alcohol level, or even her supposedly «sexual» attitude mentioned by the defense managed to minimize the seriousness of the facts: she did not consent to sexual intercourse. This conviction comes in a particular context of collective awareness on sexual violence. It is symptomatic of a change of mentalities. A symbolic, but equally universal story in the post #MeToo era.","popularity":0.1923,"poster_path":"/6PeQS9i2vLja9afzWAuzintgfj7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magneto Presse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spanton vs The French Police","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":146436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ovidie","original_name":"Ovidie","popularity":6.021,"profile_path":"/um7PDSGbrqUw8YpgP7DalWUtwEz.jpg","credit_id":"622a562f726fb1006f9b39fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":146436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ovidie","original_name":"Ovidie","popularity":6.021,"profile_path":"/um7PDSGbrqUw8YpgP7DalWUtwEz.jpg","credit_id":"622a563512c604001ce91724","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709263,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lionel Jan Kerguistel","original_name":"Lionel Jan Kerguistel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a5641d6c300006c56d6dd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134510,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luc Golfin","original_name":"Luc Golfin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a564a069f0e00702d5736","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3460556,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raphaël Guérin","original_name":"Raphaël Guérin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a56559a3c490071efba5b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3460557,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnaud Rouzy","original_name":"Arnaud Rouzy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a565e9a3c490071efba7b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329854,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Geoffroy Delacroix","original_name":"Geoffroy Delacroix","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a566bd6c300006c56d752","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Berdugo","original_name":"Marc Berdugo","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a5678498ef9006d14c417","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2213833,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Conforti","original_name":"Barbara Conforti","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622a5682069f0e001da12996","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20225228","wikidata_id":"Q118220998","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6PeQS9i2vLja9afzWAuzintgfj7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xVTyaZc4DGMvvPK3pzChMgc9E52.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Festival for Women's Rights","release_date":"2023-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
