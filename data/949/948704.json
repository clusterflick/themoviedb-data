The theme concerns the responsibility of the innovator for the thing he makes. In the film, a carpenter builds a cross but is reluctant to become involved in the right or wrong of situations that bring men to die on crosses. His interest is in his own craftsmanship. To illustrate this moral, the filmmaker used light-pen drawings, giving colour and emphasis through optical processes.","popularity":0.1362,"poster_path":"/gBdcuhOrvvrLDtnAHpd9WvcxSMv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1970-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Espolio","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":242414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Massey","original_name":"Walter Massey","popularity":0.2877,"profile_path":"/m21hh2nlcEfnhXuKLMbgMMjN0ft.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"622cdf755c5cc8007c9d5dfe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1640898,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucien Marleau","original_name":"Lucien Marleau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622cdfdd1d1bf4004566e371","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidney Goldsmith","original_name":"Sidney Goldsmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ce07c89b5610073be6210","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidney Goldsmith","original_name":"Sidney Goldsmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ce062ae3843001c6be8e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bf78346d4c9700e2760580","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925664,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kjeld Nielsen","original_name":"Kjeld Nielsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798189eb921c548d82ade14","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215754","wikidata_id":"Q123288416","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBdcuhOrvvrLDtnAHpd9WvcxSMv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1970-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
