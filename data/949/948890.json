Helen's presence of mind and nerve in swinging out over the river on the other end of the rope and thus balancing the detective until the train has passed prevents the terrible catastrophe. Later, when pursuing the culprits, Helen once more takes her life in her hands by throwing a lasso from the hand car on which they are pursuing the freight over the brake beam, and then crawling hand over hand to the top of the car.","popularity":0.1324,"poster_path":"/wtoKLMm4UvkwvcSwO3XWcs1gJuF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Detective's Peril","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gibson","original_name":"Helen Gibson","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/28xE4tpapbbEjpby7nv7IAWacSg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"622d711512970c001c72678e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Paymaster","credit_id":"622d71232866fa001b4ce173","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robyn Adair","original_name":"Robyn Adair","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/su9q0KKyBX0nOxtiUWnF4jwtD2Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Detective","credit_id":"622d7133cddbbc00473462d6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
