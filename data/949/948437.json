The plot focuses on five characters in a post-Â­apocalyptic setting. Told with humor and emotion, this film takes an authentic look at three different types of hearing loss experiences. While navigating through this tale of awareness and survival, both hearing and deaf will realize how critical effective communication is to our collective survival. The cast and crew consisted of mainly deaf and hard of hearing members from all over the country. This production, expressed primarily using American Sign Language, illustrates the great skill, creativity, and passion for filmmaking shared by these talented artists. Unlike many film productions, all proceeds made from this film will be devoted to programs and services that enhance the lives of deaf and hard of hearing people and promote greater inclusion and cooperation with the mainstreamed population-those who can hear.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are you prepared?","title":"Lake Windfall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2432258","wikidata_id":"Q16999021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
