In the guise of a cross-cultural shaman, Gómez Peña shifts into 15 different personas, each speaking a different language. The personas are symbolic of the borders between North and South, Anglo and Latino; myth and reality; legality and illegality; art and life. Border Brujo assaults and exorcises the demons of dominant cultures. He articulates fear, desire, trauma sublimation, anger and misplacement embodying ruptured and defiant communities with multilingual dexterity and humor.","popularity":0.322,"poster_path":"/gW3SqK4V14p1Avx7VivI0mDQBpO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinewest","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Border Brujo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1726447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Gómez-Peña","original_name":"Guillermo Gómez-Peña","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3yzxAcqTE4KZe9XSf7YG4wsh279.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"622d38bc350398004532578e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Artenstein","original_name":"Isaac Artenstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d38daa61de10077d1a484","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Artenstein","original_name":"Isaac Artenstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d38d2ae38430071b81f42","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Artenstein","original_name":"Isaac Artenstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d38c5f90b19001d8590f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236867,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephen Lighthill","original_name":"Stephen Lighthill","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/mnTC2RHsfsNvHQjeZos61OrC84q.jpg","credit_id":"622d38e4ea89f5001b34a93c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12350642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gW3SqK4V14p1Avx7VivI0mDQBpO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
