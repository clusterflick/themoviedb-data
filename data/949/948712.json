Yet the Faroese are equally determined to maintain their tradition, defending the practice as more sustainable and less cruel than getting meat from slaughterhouses. Director Vincent Kelner spends time with both Faroese hunters and Sea Shepherd crusaders, building to a nuanced look at a disturbing event with much larger implications for the way humans relate to other creatures.","popularity":1.2256,"poster_path":"/kQa2bpnqplHt19nlw2HOLU6iMuB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Faroese","iso_639_1":"fo","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Taste of Whale","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3462894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Kelner","original_name":"Vincent Kelner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ce874f90b19007b1c93d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17799796","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o0sv70O7zqETKahNXk0XJsnffrl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kQa2bpnqplHt19nlw2HOLU6iMuB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2bcaFO8QaFaIefrre4s4ILjEM8j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6241,"name":"stupidity"},{"id":33688,"name":"hunting"},{"id":195936,"name":"man against nature"},{"id":208155,"name":"hunting party"},{"id":224686,"name":"whales"},{"id":236859,"name":"traditional culture"},{"id":239821,"name":"man vs nature"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":251150,"name":"cultural identity"},{"id":256436,"name":"culture vs nature"},{"id":291510,"name":"people and nature"},{"id":307587,"name":"crime documentary"},{"id":334778,"name":"cultural heritage"},{"id":337710,"name":"cultural traditions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Philadelphia Environmental Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Taste of Whale | Official Trailer","key":"x8mY1OiRNiA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-03-22T22:42:55.000Z","id":"62425185dfe31d004758763d"}]}}}
