The images of women dwelling within the exterior and interior spaces are complemented by a narration recounted with a female voice. The poetic story is doubled up by an echo-like delay on a second audio track. This fact emphasizes the ambiguous character of the subject as one and/or many. The 2:30 minute long text is recounted mainly in English, but there are three short audio segments where Polish, Italian, English and French sentences are pronounced simultaneously creating an uncanny audio-cacophony. This new non-language enriches the ideas of walking on one hand, and on being grounded, on the other.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wanderlust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3460908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kinga Araya","original_name":"Kinga Araya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ace9f84591c001c22bd7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
