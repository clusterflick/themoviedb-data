Footage of their militant activities, during discussions and protests in Oakland, where they were following the trial of Black Panther leader Huey Newton, throws light on the reasons for their active support for the Afro-American revolutionary movement known as the Black Panther Party. The young American film-maker who, as part of his film project about Californian hippies, conducts a series of interviews exemplifies the type of commitment they chose. The documentary also features clips from speeches given by Black Panther party militants, an interview with Black Panther Party information secretary Kathleen Cleaver, concerts and a Black Panther military parade.","popularity":0.105,"poster_path":"/dmvQNwwQvYGSnpa4JP4hhFC0hso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un été américain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Cleaver","original_name":"Kathleen Cleaver","popularity":0.1376,"profile_path":"/iYm49HZPLDsDUUgaOzRGaqUcNMj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"622c534084591c006e7ebfcf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Chapier","original_name":"Henry Chapier","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":"/39QyqVJxoJNxh1Byvz1HWPqUCik.jpg","credit_id":"622c52eb84591c001c26caff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0351914","wikidata_id":"Q3549146","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dmvQNwwQvYGSnpa4JP4hhFC0hso.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
