Woven throughout are two other stories - one, a training video for nurses demonstrating the procedure and the other, looking through the child's now adult eyes, as she encounters women who echo reminders of the original event. These various echoes trigger post trauma squeamishness and sexual tension that is strange and complex. Both medical ethics and the labels that limit our view of sexual identity are being questioned here.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/srR3ZvNKPbxhc6Gpe6UYqdXxnRp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Body) Part One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolyn Armstrong","original_name":"Carolyn Armstrong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622bd913d363e50070cf5364","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/srR3ZvNKPbxhc6Gpe6UYqdXxnRp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
