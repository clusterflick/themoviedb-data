But the biggest inspiration was of course, From Dusk Til Dawn. It's almost a shot for shot parody of that film with Seaver's wacky comedy thrown in and his LBP style. Shot in 1996, two weeks BEFORE the original movie came out, he used Quentin Tarantino's script to base the movie off of, it was at the time the Biggest LBP film ever - with Action, lots of blood, Gay Vampires, home made squibs, this and that and what not and so forth. It has even been seen by Quentin himself when passed along to him through many a friend and was mentioned on his appearance on The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":"/g3BzmgmWR5zlRZDyj2E846xHajy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Low Budget
