The massacre was the result of a massive three month long protest against the former Government of Viktor Yanukovich and his decision to reject a trade deal with the EU. Although no thorough investigation had been conducted, the blame was immediately placed on the officers who served under Yanukovich. This program investigates the scene of the crime, interviewing those who were there when the shootings occurred, and seeks to answer the questions as to who really was shooting that day on Kyiv's Independence square - a place known to the people of Ukraine, as Maidan.â€”John Beck Hofmann","popularity":0.4504,"poster_path":"/xC8IdTZVoRRUJNuZSwy81tv1ivu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maidan Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461983,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alice Wonders","original_name":"Alice Wonders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622be4324a0b19006b23aacf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424100,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Beck Hofmann","original_name":"John Beck Hofmann","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622be2554a0b19006b23a1fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424100,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Beck Hofmann","original_name":"John Beck Hofmann","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622be390d236e6006dfeca17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4052016","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xC8IdTZVoRRUJNuZSwy81tv1ivu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ztumBtRynHEWW2y5VtWmlP2Cdhb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
