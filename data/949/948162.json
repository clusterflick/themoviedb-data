The eye occasionally blinks, looks down and is covered with an eyelid for a few seconds. It is a paradoxically peaceful video. There is a certain promise and visual tension that something is about to happen, but nothing ever happens. The image of the eye fades out to black after ten minutes. The question remains: is this videotaped omnipresent eye providential or ominous?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye for I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3460908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kinga Araya","original_name":"Kinga Araya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622acbcf84591c006e79cb75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
