But what began as a December snowfall quickly becomes a threatening winter storm, and school is dismissed for the day. The students who are unable to arrange transportation before the storm grows are forced to remain in the school gym. The six familiar strangers are the only students remaining as the outdoor conditions worsen and the doors are locked. Wills are tested, friendships are created, and secrets are revealed as they realize they must rely on each other to make it through the night.","popularity":0.1484,"poster_path":"/1SN2Q7pceUqyW30etdCgGjzkHQ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Every New Day Prictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Whats your secret?","title":"Secrets in the Snow","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hollie Bahar","original_name":"Hollie Bahar","popularity":0.2124,"profile_path":"/zgdL163SugHyFWHDf4YVElJWkD7.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"MaryJake Harper","credit_id":"653c91c3519bbb011b447dda","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Seidle","original_name":"Vincent Seidle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Grayson Thompson","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie McCaffrey","original_name":"Katie McCaffrey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Camille Sanders","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144097,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Murray","original_name":"Ashley Murray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Anthony Goodwin","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Potthast","original_name":"Elizabeth Potthast","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lynn Bolton","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Boles","original_name":"Karen Boles","popularity":0.079,"profile_path":"/i5L99ote0vgQSi3YV1d3DnH80U7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cynthia Burgess","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270e3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Michael Johnson","original_name":"Aaron Michael Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Brant Journigan","credit_id":"5cb6bc450e0a266ba2ee7e25","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Goodwin","original_name":"Brittany Goodwin","popularity":0.2908,"profile_path":"/oDJI1tQUAnAONiYeKjKWmQ4aSYF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Goodwin","original_name":"Brittany Goodwin","popularity":0.2908,"profile_path":"/oDJI1tQUAnAONiYeKjKWmQ4aSYF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c4bc3a36847f82270f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Goodwin","original_name":"Brittany Goodwin","popularity":0.2908,"profile_path":"/oDJI1tQUAnAONiYeKjKWmQ4aSYF.jpg","credit_id":"5c11c53b0e0a263143015d32","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2170579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rSVqX0XufiUKK1VEfidtbOiOmCF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1SN2Q7pceUqyW30etdCgGjzkHQ7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/5uwrlSjSNbrv2RxQdytDV5p1DvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h8OyQiJ4NuNWPEBIvfvwvM5UoQX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10794,"name":"snow"},{"id":10873,"name":"school"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
