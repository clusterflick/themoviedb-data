His grandfather attempts to comfort him by sharing the story of Easter. Although Jason is familiar with the story, it seems to offer little consolation. One night Jason dreams he has gone back in time to Jerusalem at the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. By witnessing the Crucifixion and learning of Jesus Christ's Resurrection, Jason understands that if we live our lives according to the laws and ordinances of Christ's gospel, we can be together as a family forever.","popularity":0.7002,"poster_path":"/1WopvDdifo7Kh8cStCgBDVNKmzJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young boy learns to cope with the loss of his father by discovering through a dream the true meaning of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.","title":"Easter Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":175530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Ellison","original_name":"Casey Ellison","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/84R3N1GZQiQ6Mc5Dc95qszpNG30.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jason","credit_id":"587dc5459251413ecb023299","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Rowland","original_name":"Oscar Rowland","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/bUNQTk3DVWkLE34PadOBX3BjxjN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grandpa","credit_id":"587dc564c3a36849ff01fb87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Payne","original_name":"Marvin Payne","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":"/tSqSBPUNWVt9iFe2s5jfL8zpXGT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John","credit_id":"587dc7ba9251413eec0216db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1740361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
