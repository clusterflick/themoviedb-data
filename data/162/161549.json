They hear a piano-playing octopus (with twelve arms!) and have a run-in with a sword fish who cuts their boat in half. Other hijinks ensue, and the two eventually catch a tiny fish, which is in turn swallowed by a larger fish, and this process continues until they've caught a veritable whale. They row ashore triumphant, but when one of them puts their reel (still holding the fish) over their shoulder, the larger fish slip off, unbeknownst to them, leaving them with the runt they started with.","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":"/4HpwLXjfR6I1qizKjIgEPUuwHJy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jolly Fish","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/k6IX2V57VJ7kZGUdxlzvnbe0njF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c49c3a36847f8226a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vernon Stallings","original_name":"Vernon Stallings","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/uiho47tq19hRJemmfXDxzL4GoEp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c49c3a36847f8226a17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0023078","wikidata_id":"Q110639875","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4HpwLXjfR6I1qizKjIgEPUuwHJy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nsIcszvxpyQk6bYPPEClCjIYzst.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
