In the first segment, \"The Last Hand,\" a man is shot, while another man has a heart attack. The latter man (Morty) survives, and goes to his regular poker game, but the man who was shot shows up looking well, if sinister. Morty had a hand in his death, it seems, and Morty grows increasingly agitated, and starts hallucinating. In the second segment,\"The Final Hour,\" a convicted murderer in the year 2213 is being transported to a trial for his appeal and forms a relationship with the ship's pilot. The last segment, \"Fanatical Extreme,\" is a condensed version of the feature film The Last Horror Film (1982), in which taxi driver Joe Spinell tries to realize his fantasy of making a horror movie with his favorite star, but he's not exactly welcome.","popularity":0.6777,"poster_path":"/h1GgnIpQkDnvYWuAV5jG384DaQx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thriller Zone","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Forsythe","original_name":"William Forsythe","popularity":0.7045,"profile_path":"/35BXHugSG931iVPbHn6W9SNXNY1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marcus Deerfield (segment \"The Final Hour\")","credit_id":"52fe4c43c3a36847f8225a53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60888,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carol Kottenbrook","original_name":"Carol Kottenbrook","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/73MGSV97U5cusUNf61gG43nFG3h.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(segment \"The Final Hour\")","credit_id":"52fe4c43c3a36847f8225a57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Leach","original_name":"Robin Leach","popularity":0.2742,"profile_path":"/yhCsDS8Qp0BOFZZMRhVG7KsDzO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Second Reporter (segment \"Fanatical Extreme\") (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c43c3a36847f8225a5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Munro","original_name":"Caroline Munro","popularity":0.874,"profile_path":"/CroSsO59Xc1ZddNDxRIH2qaj2I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jana Bates (segment \"Fanatical Extremes\") (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c43c3a36847f8225a5f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Spinell","original_name":"Joe Spinell","popularity":0.5625,"profile_path":"/jiok99ZvHDOj51BBgio2qvum0Mb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Vinny Durand (segment \"Fanatical Extremes\") (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c43c3a36847f8225a63","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":994387,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Glenn Takakjian","original_name":"Glenn Takakjian","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2886cbb1f68d00356a9d63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043287,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lawrence L.
