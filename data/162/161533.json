Cale - In Session at the Paradise Studios","overview":"Reluctant rock hero J.J. Cale takes the spotlight for this 80-minute session, recorded in Los Angeles in 1979 but virtually unseen until 2001. The reclusive, Oklahoma-born Cale is probably best known for writing songs made famous by others (\"After Midnight\" and \"Cocaine\" by Eric Clapton, \"Call Me the Breeze\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd). Those are among the some two dozen tunes heard here (five of which, including \"Breeze,\" are audio-only bonus tracks), as is Cale's own minor hit, \"Crazy Mama.\" The latter is a good example of the witty, laconic groove that Cale, a superb guitar player and laid-back vocalist, brings to much of his music, an appealing style that's been an obvious influence on Mark Knopfler and others.","popularity":0.3822,"poster_path":"/awy6AQR8k3MDHZPzymWATHx2Qv5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classic Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J.J.
