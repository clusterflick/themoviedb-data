The atmospheric documentary opens with hilly East Bay streets shrouded in fog. The mist lifts as the film moves to children at play. Often shown in unobtrusive close-up, the youngsters appear as thinking individuals, enjoying the swings, puzzling out problems, or interacting with their teacher in the classroom.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/t0YXzhQCVgMevA3C2sIN6ZznRbo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here I Am","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"If I Should Wake","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Baillie","original_name":"Bruce Baillie","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/gV1ezFXy2xzLJXvqug8rafWtJPC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c52c3a36847f82284e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206011","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t0YXzhQCVgMevA3C2sIN6ZznRbo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"San Francisco Film Festival","release_date":"1962-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
