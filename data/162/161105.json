For some time, his name was synonymous with speed, endurance and grace – if you did something the way Nurmi ran, you did good. But Nurmi's story had its more depressing side: He was accused of violating his amateur status. He died in disgrace, if fondly remembered.  PAAVO NURMI – THE MAN AND HIS TIMES is not so much a portrait of the runner as a vision of his time(s): Here, Nurmi is an icon, an epitome. More than most other works by von Bagh, this one has a strident rigor to it, a focused sense of ritual that fits the subject perfectly.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paavo Nurmi - The Man and His Times","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Bagh","original_name":"Peter von Bagh","popularity":0.0783,"profile_path":"/vEjzKg8RCcgvThWOF2qHx9m4eEU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c3ec3a36847f8224a29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1620569","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
