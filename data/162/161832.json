He starts with the climbing of the beanstalk; after evading the giant a few times, he ends up inside a cheese sandwich, and then in the giant's mouth, where he ultimately grabs onto a pipe and gets pulled out by the giant. In the ensuing chase, Mickey launches a pepper bomb to slow the giant down, then outruns him coming down the beanstalk and sets the stalk on fire.","popularity":0.4277,"poster_path":"/ejWDAx9tHXyNsyZ29ucGIkwKU1E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giantland","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El país de los ogros","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Topolino nel paese dei giganti","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mickey Mouse (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"55551aa29251411e620006f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcellite Garner","original_name":"Marcellite Garner","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/wnR43U3x7gVV3PM3BAZ7Kr7HQ4h.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"55551abec3a368776a00067a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burt Gillett","original_name":"Burt Gillett","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/wCMnwuzTVyheJ9mGgHVhbdm2XFY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c50c3a36847f8227d9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"55551acd9251411e5b0006e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148148,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Johnny Cannon","original_name":"Johnny Cannon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55551adec3a368776f0007fa","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225709,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Frenchy de Trémaudan","original_name":"Frenchy de Trémaudan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55551aeac3a368776c00068e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115754,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Les Clark","original_name":"Les Clark","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/3MBRk8Nm3m5FG8hcVCXKWzGhnJS.jpg","credit_id":"55551af8c3a3687772000764","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64864,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Clyde Geronimi","original_name":"Clyde Geronimi","popularity":0.5443,"profile_path":"/eAeqN6fPYuzKjGRSaR2jqhSeeMq.jpg","credit_id":"55551b019251411e4d00078d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0024057","wikidata_id":"Q3105316","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7wShSvG77pLx8AgOl06v7zFL5nd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wq5CKkGZh8kNe1CVHw00xsriVv3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3417}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ejWDAx9tHXyNsyZ29ucGIkwKU1E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xO8ukxDNkNbt1njGKU8LsUbUuVr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jdY1CS5fIjz4Sfo8bRcRMNuciRn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s0rv4nzvsnHCt7k7cmSpWDZQpTg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jPqI9r0dXO1u0hNrj5XVoykHA7u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
