Claudia Hartnell lives across the street and seems to be the perfect best friend - kind, compassionate, and a good listener. Nobody would ever guess that behind Claudia's charming facade lies an insatiable desire to live an idealized life. Nobody would suspect that her relentless childhood obsession is about to turn to murderous rage. Claudia wants everything that Beth holds dear and will use any means necessary to take it all away from her best friend.","popularity":1.3602,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3958,"logo_path":"/xkdYNmOW6e4gjgp4NSLRt0W5UIj.png","name":"Front Street Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Best Friends","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Gallagher","original_name":"Megan Gallagher","popularity":0.5019,"profile_path":"/c6s5tcndCytgP7kaJelisYFWPES.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Beth Emerson","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudette Mink","original_name":"Claudette Mink","popularity":0.2625,"profile_path":"/ltuvfqDVM0ZEnEUL5b9NqZQkHt6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Claudia Hartnell","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barclay Hope","original_name":"Barclay Hope","popularity":0.5938,"profile_path":"/64DyRr2dUcrd0gPjgEBHIcDMSDo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kurt","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":172864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Ranger","original_name":"Liam Ranger","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/q5fmzP7QTouIhEEuZ8pmkvaERt0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c69","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittney Wilson","original_name":"Brittney Wilson","popularity":0.4457,"profile_path":"/3XFIqSRlPSQpFfmeHfA41HMFT2o.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c6d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nels Lennarson","original_name":"Nels Lennarson","popularity":0.459,"profile_path":"/lWsQopdsGhBoTeZphWwK9RL0Ya8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dan","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c71","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Kosakoski","original_name":"Graham Kosakoski","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/z39huRilCfA4yNqO5QLn6bdqMh6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c4fc3a36847f8227c75","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael M.
