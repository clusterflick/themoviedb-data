The directress stands them in a row, and taking the head off each, throws it onto a huge music staff and each becomes a note of the scale. The whole bodies appear again, after which the manipulator seems to wrap them up in a large sheet of music, which is then shown to contain nothing. The paper is rolled up again, and a cane is held, perpendicularly, in a horizontal position to the sheet.","popularity":0.0765,"poster_path":"/tLQnyIvxg7ZzQLIrCjao2b7tjvX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music, Forward!","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1119494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julienne Mathieu","original_name":"Julienne Mathieu","popularity":0.069,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55928e2192514152d20008d4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c47c3a36847f8226683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0449232","wikidata_id":"Q18230683","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tLQnyIvxg7ZzQLIrCjao2b7tjvX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
