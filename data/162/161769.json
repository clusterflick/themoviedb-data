It was a film about American music, about three pieces of three LPs. There was a song by Van Morrison, another by Harvey Mandel, and one of Credence Clearwater Revival. It was mainly the music and some shots out of a car, landscapes out of the car window. And it had a little bit of commentary – dialogue between Peter and me about American music and about how American rock music was about emotion and images instead of sounds. That is to say, about a kind of phenomenon, that it was in a way a kind of film music, but without a moving picture. It was a 12-minute film and it was never shown. – Wim Wenders","popularity":0.1536,"poster_path":"/3W7t6uwptxNjBhz8HOdvnSMKKFk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wim Wenders Stiftung","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 American LPs","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"3 amerikai nagylemez","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Tre LP americani","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Trzy amerykanskie longplaye","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"3 amerikanische LP's","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Handke","original_name":"Peter Handke","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"582a0b41c3a368360f03d46c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Wenders","original_name":"Wim Wenders","popularity":1.0062,"profile_path":"/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"582a0b479251417b2103ad81","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Handke","original_name":"Peter Handke","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c4dc3a36847f82276cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Wenders","original_name":"Wim Wenders","popularity":1.0062,"profile_path":"/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c4dc3a36847f82276c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harvey Mandel","original_name":"Harvey Mandel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582a0b579251417b2103ad86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Van Morrison","original_name":"Van Morrison","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":"/p2dxqN8jaBIgWfFeecQZP875Wbu.jpg","credit_id":"582a0b609251417b2903b4b6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Wenders","original_name":"Wim Wenders","popularity":1.0062,"profile_path":"/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg","credit_id":"582a0b69c3a36823580046e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0064262","wikidata_id":"Q9362346","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3W7t6uwptxNjBhz8HOdvnSMKKFk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
