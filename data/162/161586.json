He gives a zany performance on the piano, but the employees and the customers are just as wacky. A gorilla waiter dances while serving. Three identical cats display a peculiar way of eating. A chicken has a nauseating way of making chicken soup. The nightclub singer tells corny jokes. Even the hat racks come to life and dance. A horse imbibing a too-strong drink provides the show-stopper.","popularity":0.1949,"poster_path":"/nOJ9MEnvgKwETnFjeB9QtGvrxUA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harman-Ising Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goopy Geer","video":false,"vote_average":5.429,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh Harman","original_name":"Hugh Harman","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/6aVWLy6yqpN8OdrkLzH3LeUcO2N.jpg","credit_id":"56c694799251410e38000467","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Ising","original_name":"Rudolf Ising","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/mPcWz8CHJTftnY4QRmpJRmw07Bm.jpg","credit_id":"56c69480c3a3680d44005266","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leon Schlesinger","original_name":"Leon Schlesinger","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/is9gdhtLfaCYwWdeACDgAjdDA1w.jpg","credit_id":"56c69487c3a3680d41004e67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123191,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rollin Hamilton","original_name":"Rollin Hamilton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c694a79251412451004cab","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh Harman","original_name":"Hugh Harman","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/6aVWLy6yqpN8OdrkLzH3LeUcO2N.jpg","credit_id":"56c6946ac3a3680d4400525f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306740,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Marsales","original_name":"Frank Marsales","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c6948ec3a3680d4400526a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Ising","original_name":"Rudolf Ising","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/mPcWz8CHJTftnY4QRmpJRmw07Bm.jpg","credit_id":"56c694719251412449005024","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"56c6949f925141244900502e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13960,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernard B.
