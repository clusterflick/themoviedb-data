He's fearless and the strongest man in the land. He's ready and willing to take on all wrong doers-rich and poor. Accompanied by a lovable, meek little friend, his quest takes him on an unforgettable journey. Swamp monsters, knights in armor, duels, royal pageantry, and damsels in distress all abound in this story of timeless values. In the spirit of \"Robin Hood,\" it's a robust, romantic tale: a feast for the eyes and a joy for the heart.","popularity":0.4325,"poster_path":"/zSrLXx0nAXBmF8xE9bDob0V6uaA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11619,"logo_path":"/lpjHtqZkBZflKjCe33nHXKF7YNV.png","name":"Belgische Radio en
