Shot in Oslo, Helsinki, Istanbul and Berlin. The film focuses on showing the actual moments that lead to getting to know one another, building a relationship and to breaking up. The film takes part in Kaisa’s attempt of getting involved with two different men that look almost exactly the same, questioning where the thin line is between someone potentially being the love of your life or not. Shooting the film with the approach of a workshop and closely involving the actors allows the film to take shape as a unique, unpredictable cinematic expression touching the basis and complexity of human behavior.","popularity":0.3595,"poster_path":"/7s57qgcQXsQ2fZutjnf6YBMeuoi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7843,"logo_path":"/v293yOJQyswsz3bLQ7eylTcsvdp.png","name":"4 1/2","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2012-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Must Have Been Love","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"En som du","type":"Swedish"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Tola","original_name":"Pamela Tola","popularity":0.289,"profile_path":"/q9WTI0X1j1IAZKSIHkTd7kXpBRn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kaisa","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f822688d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Birn","original_name":"Laura Birn","popularity":1.0339,"profile_path":"/7aFAUPKj1joqQ2VOWOuGh88biuH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f8226895","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audun Hjort","original_name":"Audun Hjort","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Audun","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f8226899","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mattis Herman Nyquist","original_name":"Mattis Herman Nyquist","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/rPS420CCVr2jRb2LLtttcDqzSn4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"August","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f822689d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pål Sverre Hagen","original_name":"Pål Sverre Hagen","popularity":0.7517,"profile_path":"/eJzuZZfFBaMSgcbR3Pe5zBxEC3z.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f82268a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pihla Viitala","original_name":"Pihla Viitala","popularity":0.8388,"profile_path":"/4arJbR42gQfEdWOrnZKIJTuLCLF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helmi","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f82268a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Espen Klouman Høiner","original_name":"Espen Klouman Høiner","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/kJK72kZDtO7nqi8BUONhvxrQDYy.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jacob / Andreas","credit_id":"5a4db5c70e0a26480e004604","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1148925,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jyrki Väisänen","original_name":"Jyrki Väisänen","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f82268b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eirik Svensson","original_name":"Eirik Svensson","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/uCHZiT5bFitUkGtqFXFef3MFQCI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f8226889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eirik Svensson","original_name":"Eirik Svensson","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/uCHZiT5bFitUkGtqFXFef3MFQCI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c48c3a36847f82268ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2275861","wikidata_id":"Q11967418","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2041,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8M3l5dUtRRiWnfNc3WDuqOpCchi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3628}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/7s57qgcQXsQ2fZutjnf6YBMeuoi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1497},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1962,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ninil1NrQsIlguq2YvvlS9yirLX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1398}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
