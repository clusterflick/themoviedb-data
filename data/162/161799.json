A cabinet-maker, an orthopaedic surgeon and a retired geologist make for interesting fireside company. With a cumulative age of 145 years these three men are attempting to grow old gracefully. They might not be world-class climbers, but they are world-class buddies out on the narrow ledge.  Their failures (put down to old age) and their successes take them from Table Mountain in Cape Town to the lichen covered walls of Blouberg in the Limpopo Province. Cameo appearances by other (sometimes more youthful) inspirational boulderers, trad and sport climbers represent the various themes in climbing life as perceived by the three friends.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2007-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An honest insight into friendship and the climbing life","title":"Tea for Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"All Ages","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
