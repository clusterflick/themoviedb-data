It starts with a look at a farm, beneath which is oil. Soon, farmland is dotted with derricks. It's on to a refinery. Then, shots of oil derricks, their pumps and pistons moving, are interspersed with images of men at work and machines in motion powered by oil. Horse-drawn carts are discarded. Modern wheels turn. The narration consists of title cards written in a grandiose and rhetorical style - the bones of yesterday become the blood of today.","popularity":0.0609,"poster_path":"/4wVHzOUXfE27gVsG2ky8KCX4KOh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A self-proclaimed saga of oil, celebrating the speed and power of plane, trains, and automobiles.","title":"Oil: A Symphony in Motion","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.G.
