When the two are discovered cheating by their professor, the longed-for scholarship recommendation is withdrawn. Meanwhile the jealousy of Betty's boy friend has been aroused and when Marv learns that he can only hold the girl's affections by offering her riches, he plans a million dollar robbery. Even the professional gangsters with whom he works are amazed at the brilliance of the young genius. Again, however, he is double crossed by Betty who has warned her friend and his gang of the plan. When the police also learn of the activities the project as well as the lives of a number of the boys ends in tragedy.","popularity":1.216,"poster_path":"/hykr4TX2E6kk6Jul8v2in7HrhfO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sparta Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":13733,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Filmgroup","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The kid who showed the big time how!","title":"High School Big Shot","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Pittman","original_name":"Tom Pittman","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/5xaCky5LG3sJeqOquTDZSt41yka.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marvin 'Marv' Grant","credit_id":"52fe4c3ec3a36847f8224989","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1191469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Aldridge","original_name":"Virginia Aldridge","popularity":0.278,"profile_path":"/2ySUgJtarJybolp43zoaAwMs8ns.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Betty Alexander","credit_id":"52fe4c3ec3a36847f822498d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Veit","original_name":"Howard Veit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vince Rumbo","credit_id":"52fe4c3ec3a36847f8224991","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Atterbury","original_name":"Malcolm Atterbury","popularity":0.2945,"profile_path":"/o6Yv4FlVeLTLCNisOPQxI0zGCAs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Grant","credit_id":"52fe4c3ec3a36847f8224995","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Adams","original_name":"Stanley Adams","popularity":0.3232,"profile_path":"/zcOvq0nh5llUce33ozlqD8r1Eyc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harry March","credit_id":"52fe4c3ec3a36847f8224999","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Quinn","original_name":"Louis Quinn","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/jJrwbxMVGH4SQoqtsB33JwJwPpi.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Samuel Tallman","credit_id":"63c997e0ed96bc007b4fb95b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Leeds","original_name":"Peter Leeds","popularity":0.3392,"profile_path":"/lxKP01Y2qRdcDgvKX58Mm6XPPJp.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Mr. Carter","credit_id":"63c997f168afd60086f984d0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Barrick","original_name":"John Barrick","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Larry Walker","credit_id":"63c9980a0398ab0099f5b22b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Murphy","original_name":"Jimmy Murphy","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/3OcCvlA4bNEWM8J5NwWPosaLMlj.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Burt Rogers","credit_id":"63c99824ed96bc00838d2d17","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Foulger","original_name":"Byron Foulger","popularity":0.6505,"profile_path":"/8j1Mn3alrcZyfe742LCfjCglQ3L.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Mr. Mathews","credit_id":"63c9983568afd6008ef5abbf","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1339120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Hall","original_name":"Bobby Hall","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/ri0XOaOr82Xp5fnltZ3OkniThyo.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Johnson","credit_id":"63c998470398ab008e23022f","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerald Fried","original_name":"Gerald Fried","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/vtx9R0AT9YMybr8ekqh0Vu7d5k6.jpg","credit_id":"622fbf7165c26c00771f78ad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89160,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carlo Lodato","original_name":"Carlo Lodato","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622fbf32cf62cd00446da009","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stanley Bickman","original_name":"Stanley Bickman","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622fbe850ff15a007bc59c1a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John M.
