However, doctors are unanimous: they do not give a physiological reason for this comatose state, so they conclude that it is of a psychological nature. Bruno Aleixo, an assumed hater of the Christmas spirit, simply refuses to wake up. Using the recognized archetype of Charles Dickens' Christmas Tale, sleeping Bruno Aleixo relives, in dreams, several traumatic Christmases of the past, present and future.","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":"/x3S3PZFLxuzn49sft9KtsgEgdE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9020,"logo_path":"/qAcfiiC2WPGrfotZPnoHkDtQ6lr.png","name":"O Som e a Fúria","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Natal do Bruno Aleixo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808704,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"João Moreira","original_name":"João Moreira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yrGeA9EQreNFOK2loVIB5zKTXE0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bruno Aleixo / Homem do Bussaco / Renato Alexandre / Nelson","credit_id":"634c6b9768b1ea008232b422","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3743806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrique Guerra","original_name":"Henrique Guerra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Psicólogo","credit_id":"634c6b80a7e363007d7cce73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3743809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Lemos","original_name":"João Lemos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ribeiro","credit_id":"634c6c591089ba007ab34878","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Santo","original_name":"Pedro Santo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Busto","credit_id":"634c6cec68b1ea007f597de6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808704,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"João Moreira","original_name":"João Moreira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yrGeA9EQreNFOK2loVIB5zKTXE0.jpg","credit_id":"63421ebce2102300978b7b96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808704,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"João Moreira","original_name":"João Moreira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yrGeA9EQreNFOK2loVIB5zKTXE0.jpg","credit_id":"634c6bc712eb89007d1f3335","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Santo","original_name":"Pedro Santo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634c6cff8c44b9007a7b8f0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Santo","original_name":"Pedro Santo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634c6d13ef9d7200916464a0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22694970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gQrwFAlHkykvnA1qlRKMxgxavHj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1UicBdNIDamZypMuHXCTEyrDn7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Jy83YSZfpzvdjvK296qWA5rmpe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.993,"height":138,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/al1gGVizDCfuEQ4I2gHUZBiGEfh.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":689},{"aspect_ratio":1.437,"height":474,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/8bHDNpbjKxADBZoUUG3yAqeim69.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":681}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/x3S3PZFLxuzn49sft9KtsgEgdE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2418,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/bMxwaAargxwDbmNScs2kieAdkbH.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1712},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e5ULLCbOjdSwV4GmBVcPWyUpub2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":769},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v79o03TIx4mIenJ7TmcmEoOHFxK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"São Paulo International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
