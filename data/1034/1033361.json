In today's world, where human relationships are increasingly disposable, religious vows, on the other hand, are a lifelong commitment. The documentary reveals a reality that most people don't have access to, inside monasteries and abbeys.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ueQn4RrjnUdZKRYWF0137tDez6s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Votos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ângela Patrícia Reiniger","original_name":"Ângela Patrícia Reiniger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634222f025b955007a8ae610","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":939,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ueQn4RrjnUdZKRYWF0137tDez6s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
