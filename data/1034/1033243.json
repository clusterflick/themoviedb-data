After she died of cancer at the age of 48, Van der Winden was approached at the funeral by Lieke's foster brother. She learns that her grandfather and grandmother – of whom she has wonderful memories – were wrong in the Second World War. This fact, which had played an enormous role in Lieke's life, had been kept secret for decades. Only thirty years after that revelation Van der Winden dares to delve into her mother's history. In conversations with family and friends, she gains a whole new perspective on Lieke and on her own childhood. And when she searches the archives for her grandparents' activities during the war, the shocking revelations pile up – with major emotional consequences.","popularity":0.1327,"poster_path":"/c2IUrtVDzOS9zjuNPpOTgUFvNFu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Witfilm","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":99613,"logo_path":"/u9a9AizRCLzcDMKqJnAy0uYtCJT.png","name":"KRO-NCRV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het Verzwijgen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170490,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sander Snoep","original_name":"Sander Snoep","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6341dd20a284eb0079c3f165","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3732349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marieke van der Winden","original_name":"Marieke van der Winden","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6341dce4b18f3200797dfb6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boudewijn Koole","original_name":"Boudewijn Koole","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/qVGHrskbVIy2sqBmbnRtpiJSFV0.jpg","credit_id":"6341dd0ca284eb007c5d57f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3732349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marieke van der Winden","original_name":"Marieke van der Winden","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6341dcf1a5743d008365d9fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13156068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1127,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2IUrtVDzOS9zjuNPpOTgUFvNFu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
