In 1930's Berlin, Prinz was a young rabbi as the Hitler regime was rising to power. Civil rights of Jews were systematically being stripped away and Prinz restored the self-esteem of the German Jews. Although the Nazis monitored his sermons and despite repeated arrests, Prinz continued to preach, urging Jews to leave Germany. Expelled from Germany in 1937, Prinz arrived in the United States and was horrified to witness racism against African Americans. Prinz became a leader of the civil rights movement and spoke at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 which has its 50th anniversary this year.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joachim Prinz: I Shall Not Be Silent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2782050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
