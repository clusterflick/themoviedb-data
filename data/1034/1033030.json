For the first hour of OK Today Tomorrow, he stages a series of fraught encounters around the city between four gentrified New Yorkers before abandoning his vague narrative of youthful angst altogether in favor of documenting the urban landscape itself. The dusk-to-dawn “city symphony” that ends the film resembles similar Super8 social studies by Vogl’s uptown contemporary John Ahearn; both recorded the daily lives of working-class black and immigrant communities on the streets of a city on the verge of the corporate takeover and sweeping gentrification that followed in the 1980s and ’90s. Preserved by The Museum of Modern Art, New York.","popularity":0.4041,"poster_path":"/9ELczQYFq46Pf4LByfq1weSNMxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For the first hour of OK Today Tomorrow, Vogl stages a series of fraught encounters around the city between four gentrified New Yorkers before abandoning his vague narrative of youthful angst altogether in favor of documenting the urban landscape itself.","title":"OK Today Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arto Lindsay","original_name":"Arto Lindsay","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/epAaS0vghcrXbpdux5ReLNpQjpl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63414b6de8d028007f68abaa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950216,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joan Waltemath","original_name":"Joan Waltemath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63414b8671ffdf007a247f95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3731584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence Sellers","original_name":"Terence Sellers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63414b93a61de100913543fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3731585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jef Bretschneide","original_name":"Jef Bretschneide","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63414ba2a61de1007dda9d55","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wright","original_name":"Tom Wright","popularity":0.6986,"profile_path":"/lJ4L5fdXBeNr528gBB4eMTdvfd4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63414bae9c97bd00903a3eff","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3731581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harald Vogl","original_name":"Harald Vogl","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63414b1825b955007a8ab505","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3731582,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bibiena Houwer","original_name":"Bibiena Houwer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63414b34a61de1007aea2cb8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950217,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Seth Tillett","original_name":"Seth Tillett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63414b5539a1a6007ca4306a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1664932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harald Vogl","original_name":"Harald Vogl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6341505fe4b576007bfcec7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2190,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ELczQYFq46Pf4LByfq1weSNMxG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1482}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":5768,"name":"urban life"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":163082,"name":"gentrification"},{"id":208289,"name":"1980s"},{"id":304617,"name":"youthful angst"},{"id":304618,"name":"urban landscape"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
