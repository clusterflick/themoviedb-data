He packs his bag with objects that remind him of his loved ones and embarks on a journey into the unknown. Soon he is starving and resorts to eating the objects he has packed. The effects are monstrous yet they give him the strength to carry on through the scorching desert. Eventually, he arrives half-dead on the other shore of the sea and eats the most precious of his objects: a family portrait. This gives him the strength to finish his journey.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/sra2LtWoWg6REjBfe1H0b54SNEi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202333,"logo_path":"/pnpIOc6GlQnCcEGzH03oYbP8LtW.png","name":"Reynard Films","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":145507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiresias Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rest in Piece","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589043,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Thummet","original_name":"Simon Thummet","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b495bfd4f800101b7fd94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georg Neubert","original_name":"Georg Neubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b492b67b61300c8499289","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285714,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laure Dahout","original_name":"Laure Dahout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b493e41a561336b79c6d5","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Antabi","original_name":"Antoine Antabi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b496c532acb53371ee74e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4114918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katharina Weser","original_name":"Katharina Weser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b48ab67b61300e5dc6c20","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297844,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Wiesbaum","original_name":"Erik Wiesbaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b48d041a561336b79c69c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Antabi","original_name":"Antoine Antabi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b499d1ac2927b2dcf61d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228921,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maximilian Raible","original_name":"Maximilian Raible","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b48de532acb5338835ed9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Antabi","original_name":"Antoine Antabi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63439397647654008234d453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734280,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jasper Wiedhöft","original_name":"Jasper Wiedhöft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634393a607e281007dd49dd0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Antabi","original_name":"Antoine Antabi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6343939da61de1007ddb2b44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2060437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonatan Schwenk","original_name":"Jonatan Schwenk","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6778583b9cb089e051669e9e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14163054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sra2LtWoWg6REjBfe1H0b54SNEi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e1RwqrgInKgJWsteReVGk1DamfF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Short Shorts Film Festival ","release_date":"2022-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Palm Springs International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rest in piece - Antoine Antabi - Teaser v.1","key":"727786891","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-07T14:33:56.000Z","id":"6449da5da39d0b042d246e9a"}]}}}
