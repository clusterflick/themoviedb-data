She began contributing to the magazine in 2019 and became the first Black, female cartoonist in The New Yorker’s near century run. Montague’s cartoons push the publication’s boundaries through focussing on the intersection of self and social awareness in an accessible style with clean lines and representative subjects. Montague sketches a world in which Black women are the main characters.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between the Lines: Liz at Large","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3733511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Montague","original_name":"Liz Montague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"634305b371ffdf007a24fe27","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3733509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abi Cole","original_name":"Abi Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634305925b4fed007fe700fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
