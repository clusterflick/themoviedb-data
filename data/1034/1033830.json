But this errand soon transforms into a wondrous adventure. As Seven-year-old Ahmed runs determinedly through the alleyways—constantly distracted by the people and events (or perhaps non-events) around him—his journey becomes both a delicate observation of the familial community of Ibb, and an intimate voyage through the Old City’s endangered architecture and beautiful landscape. While Ahmed plays beads with other kids, stumbles into a funeral, and listens to folktales narrated by an 82-year-old, the looming question of whether he’ll make it home before lunch grows larger. Performed by city locals, In the Long Run presents gentle conversations about fear, fate, and faith. Yet, most importantly, it is a story of a child’s imagination, curiosity and wonder.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/w15cHJTKEYzV4CcvwkZhiHX6JxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YE","name":"Yemen"}],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Long Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed Essam Farea'","original_name":"Ahmed Essam Farea'","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63439c4e3c887d007c939526","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yousef Assabahi","original_name":"Yousef Assabahi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63439c2db7a154007cc6c7d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yousef Assabahi","original_name":"Yousef Assabahi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63439c329c97bd00903add1c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ala'a Amer","original_name":"Ala'a Amer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63439c3db7a154007cc6c7eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w15cHJTKEYzV4CcvwkZhiHX6JxG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
