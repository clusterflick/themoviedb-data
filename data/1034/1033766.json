The main character comes from Russia to Germany with his parents, Russian Germans. In the cycle of Berlin life, he is trying to find himself and his place in a new environment for him. A student of a German school, a part–time worker, a seller of a Russian fish shop, a statistician of the \"German Opera\", a petty criminal - his path runs through such a bizarre line.  The multifaceted Russian Berlin with all the tragic comedy of emigrant life becomes the background of its existence. Here he meets many different people, finds his love, indulges in dashing fun with friends, the same immigrants as him, works, paints, makes plans for the future and ... by chance becomes an accomplice to murder. So the breadth of central Russia narrowed around him to the size of a prison cell in Germany.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":318,"logo_path":"/q0UG4oZERwIywJdDPF4lRlvdYGW.png","name":"CTB Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2009-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Migrant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeniy Epshtein","original_name":"Evgeniy Epshtein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6343515e647654007a7c7f0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7592,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergei Selyanov","original_name":"Сергей Сельянов","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/k8dNGu40igaP4svQSnkIPV2Pq4p.jpg","credit_id":"6343524acdf2e600910355f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
