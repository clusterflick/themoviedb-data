The story is told through the eyes of Alex Gonzalez, a pothead who is kidnapped by his best friend Chris during a minor drug transaction and forced to be a PA on the set of an ultra low budget movie. Alex has no idea what a PA does or what it takes to make a movie but he has common sense, which is lacking heavily on this set. Chris promises Alex that he'll drive him home as soon as they get the first shot completed; but for this feature, getting anything in the can is a major task.","popularity":0.1623,"poster_path":"/u8wsi1jwEupX3eMOPmf2pJ1VoqH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do It in Post","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvin Lima","original_name":"Melvin Lima","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alex Gonzalez","credit_id":"63423ea3cf62cd00990cbfb8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3732667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Myles","original_name":"Harrison Myles","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chris Langley","credit_id":"63423f6ee4b576009b90c517","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Greene","original_name":"Chris Greene","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/xhujfdctf29YnSb0Qq9EkkZRbji.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Erick Saunders","credit_id":"63423f8939a1a6008e8b53ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3732668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tammy Torres","original_name":"Tammy Torres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rachel Tamara","credit_id":"63423f9d7eb5f2007e3680cd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3732664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Dionne","original_name":"Rob Dionne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63423e7e2d37210090d55d8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3732664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Dionne","original_name":"Rob Dionne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63423e739c97bd00796cf122","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1640445","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u8wsi1jwEupX3eMOPmf2pJ1VoqH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
