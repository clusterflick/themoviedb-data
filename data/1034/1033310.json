Their childish routine of roaming streets, riding scooters and vaping will change so soon — only Slava stays in Yuryevets with his foster family, most of his friends are leaving to study or work in a week.  Vlad dreams about a military career. He wants “to save lives” just like characters in his favorite computer games and to earn enough money for his poor parents who work in a local supermarket. At his birthday party the teens argue and try to dissuade Vlad but he has already made his choice. Hope there will be no war in the future — they say.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Kill What Lives Inside Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariya Chernaya","original_name":"Mariya Chernaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63420d030d11f2007ac1192b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
