From Brussels to Tel-Aviv, from Paris to New-York, this documentary charts the sites of her peregrinations. An experimental filmmaker, a nomad, Chantal Akerman shares her cinematic trajectory, one that has never ceased to interrogate the the meaning of her existence. Thanks in great part to the interventions of her editor, Claire Atherton, she delineates the origins of her film language and her aesthetic stance.","popularity":0.1906,"poster_path":"/75oLwBRXPB2sCPoGb2TTs3EzxrZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11773,"logo_path":"/8fCjsqh43LbPV6pm3SfR5Jx64GU.png","name":"Artémis
