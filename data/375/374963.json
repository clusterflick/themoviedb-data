The resulting damage was then repaired and the separate lengths joined together in strict order. At its simplest it is a pun on the phrase \"to shoot film\". My idea was to portray the concept of shooting a film as a physical and literal action. The film can be seen as pure documentation of an act. The damage done becomes the image and the soundtrack.\" -Pope","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/nWGVLuULQXm8WfoQehBmfbJ9pjt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shot Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Pope","original_name":"Greg Pope","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5683ce5fc3a3685f890032ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13557392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2SOiQzK8U0tmIXgJDcibGcagxna.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nWGVLuULQXm8WfoQehBmfbJ9pjt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shot Film","key":"45502584","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2012-07-10T11:43:48.000Z","id":"619fe6b4f90b19002a9d7eac"}]}}}
