Not the best times for shop owners like Jozef Piasecki - obstacles from authorities, restricted wholesale supplies. Moreover, he constantly argues with his son, the 17 year old Witek. Witek experiences love for the first time. This should be a time of great excitement for him, but Witek, being rather anxious about the future, becomes an example of a youth generation growing up under the long shadow of Stalin.","popularity":0.2656,"poster_path":"/sUu28JKG3OriQiWqO7fplS2BBqi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy
