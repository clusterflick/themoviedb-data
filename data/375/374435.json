Things look bad at home. His mother is in the hospital because her husband beat her up. The drunken father has long since brought in a replacement, a homeless woman. The teenager lives in eternal stress with the alcoholic, but gains respect from his father through his right-wing radical friends. From now on, his home becomes the main meeting place of the clique. When one of the antisocial outings of the clique ends fatally for one of the victims, the father offers his son and his friends first an alibi, later a hiding
