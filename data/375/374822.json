Texts by J.K. Gibson-Graham, Fredric Jameson, Paul B. Preciado, and Subcomandante Marcos that originally opposed economic and sexual hegemony are repurposed as part of a manifesto against the internet itself, critiquing its logic and suggesting possible alternatives.  This is the third work presented as part of Real Live Online, curated by Lucas G. Pinheiro and Devin Kenny. It follows IDPW's Internet Bedroom, and João Enxuto and Erica Love's Waiting for the Internet.","popularity":0.2337,"poster_path":"/rbq9VfPXUtZn1B3jzHwTYx410RH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contra-Internet Inversion Practice #1: Constituting an Outside (Utopian Plagiarism)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Blas","original_name":"Zach Blas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5682a467c3a3685f89000600","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rbq9VfPXUtZn1B3jzHwTYx410RH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":961}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11615,"name":"internet"},{"id":221662,"name":"contra-internet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
