Born into a family that supports the nationalist Kuomintang, Zhang eventually became a leftist and joined the Communist Party. But his family’s background eventually catches up with him, and in a series of bureaucratic measures, he is labelled as a Rightist, leading to a slew of irrational yet life-affecting consequences.  His story is told through an exhilarating hybrid of forms, blending documentary-styled interviews and spectral theatrical displays within an ever-mutating studio-space. Hypnagogic in its imagery and ironic in attitude, Mr. Zhang Believes is a tour-de-force treatise of a man caught within dogmatic political maneuverings, which it critiques indirectly with creative and stoic fervour.","popularity":0.2872,"poster_path":"/4AyOhdE1RI6kyNBEYbyVv9MORJU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Zhang Believes","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3971525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Cheng","original_name":"Yang Cheng","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"641925f32b8a430099f4dcda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3838167,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zhang Tuoyu","original_name":"Zhang Tuoyu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"641926082b8a43007b794a11","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3143094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yi Sicheng","original_name":"易思成","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641926122b8a430099f4dce8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qiu Jiongjiong","original_name":"邱炯炯","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/pl5R6WmdRhRUdtwL2MtItpgufs9.jpg","credit_id":"5690506ac3a3686b49000189","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5032452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4AyOhdE1RI6kyNBEYbyVv9MORJU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1654},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bIH6Tc89Sfc0Muvg4hdLYvuPIY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1654},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wgC79a2WB5U2x85UFddRQpXeErv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mr Zhang Believes Trailer | SGIFF 2015","key":"ABVJI_Rcfto","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-10-27T09:57:31.000Z","id":"5f1fc846b4a5430035328d2e"}]}}}
