Their lyrics speak of daily life; civil war, street violence, corruption, drugs and the disappearance of close friends. Despite everything, they cling to hope and this they express through their music. The film is made in 8 mm and DVCAM and includes Flash Animations. Some of the footage is shot by the musicians themselves. The power of Latin American hip-hop street life confronts the horror of the Columbian war.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":70933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidicon GmbH Berlin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beatbox Colombia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554443,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dirk Lienig","original_name":"Dirk Lienig","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804e4e92514132db00bc51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554443,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dirk Lienig","original_name":"Dirk Lienig","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804e6892514131df00b805","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554444,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sebastian Höhn","original_name":"Sebastian Höhn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804e81c3a36860e900d7cf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554445,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oliver Karsitz","original_name":"Oliver Karsitz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804e9592514132db00bc5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554446,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Wolter","original_name":"Peter Wolter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804eb1c3a3684be900d7fa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karsten Höfer","original_name":"Karsten Höfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804ec69251417ddd00e1cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554447,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Benjamin Seelig","original_name":"Benjamin Seelig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804ee8c3a3684be900d808","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554448,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rene Bissinger","original_name":"Rene Bissinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804f189251417ddd00e1d3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554449,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Hans Pfleiderer","original_name":"Hans Pfleiderer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804f2992514132db00bc72","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Anderson-Bazzoli","original_name":"Christopher Anderson-Bazzoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804f479251417def00e5e9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lidia Perico","original_name":"Lidia Perico","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804f76c3a3682abc006d28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554453,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sören Schmidt","original_name":"Sören Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56804f94c3a368227b003eaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karsten Höfer","original_name":"Karsten Höfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5680fb4492514132db00db9a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karsten Höfer","original_name":"Karsten Höfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5680fb4ec3a3682abc008bdc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5298578","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
