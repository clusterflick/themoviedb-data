Julius gets off to a bad start when his car takes off, without him, in the wrong direction; it takes him a while to get it straightened out. Alice and the bad guy battle a bit for the lead, which Alice takes; they pass a detour, which the bad guy changes the sign for. Julius, taking the bad road, eventually drives up a cliff and, after a mighty struggle at the top, makes it, in third place, to the changeover. Alice and the bad guy ride off on horses; Julius has a wind-up wooden horse. Julius' horse keeps breaking down, eventually losing the back legs (Julius uses an empty thought balloon to hold up the rear). Alice's horse jumps a fence, and won't continue. The bad guy looks like he'll win, but Alice makes a mighty leap and knocks him off to win the race","popularity":0.2007,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice Wins the Derby","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margie Gay","original_name":"Margie Gay","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Alice (uncredited)","credit_id":"567d375fc3a36860e9004315","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"567d376a9251412e520044b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419055,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Marcus","original_name":"Mike Marcus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567d3786c3a36860e900431c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"567d37759251417dec006c1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123191,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rollin Hamilton","original_name":"Rollin Hamilton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567d3792c3a368607500439c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553450,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Thurston Harper","original_name":"Thurston Harper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567d37a0c3a3684be30069f1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ub Iwerks","original_name":"Ub Iwerks","popularity":0.4358,"profile_path":"/8zD9v1AeqDF5PJ6VioIK2FA4GuA.jpg","credit_id":"567d37a9c3a3684bc90073ce","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0015559","wikidata_id":"Q2836678","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2673,"name":"horse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
