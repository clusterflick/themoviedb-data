Filming in the jungles of Rwanda for John Bishop’s Gorilla Adventure, the comedian realises adolescent male mountain gorillas are just like his teenage sons – bulging muscles but no sense. Plus they fart, flirt and pick their noses. We follow John as he joins a group of vets who have dedicated their lives to saving the, sadly, precious few mountain gorillas left in the wild rugged mountains and valleys between the borders of Rwanda, Congo and Uganda, which were made famous to UK viewers by David Attenborough’s iconic sequence filmed among them in the 1970s.","popularity":0.6207,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"}],"release_date":"2015-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"John Bishop travels to the forests of Rwanda to meet the indigenous gorilla population.","title":"John Bishop's Gorilla Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bishop","original_name":"John Bishop","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/tooZmoOa6YLZTyak8gbbYXFeile.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"568201dfc3a3682abc00b8a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525848,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julian Braatvedt","original_name":"Julian Braatvedt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693ed77cffda006548c4fa","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490291,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Ngugi","original_name":"Richard Ngugi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693ef29f37b00050874f82","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525851,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ayubu Kasasa","original_name":"Ayubu Kasasa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693f1612aabc0067aadce2","department":"Production","job":"Location Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2804066,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Deborah Williams","original_name":"Deborah Williams","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693f57387651016580da99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Bland","original_name":"Simon Bland","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693f74ea37e0118783fc39","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":58519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Duncan","original_name":"Ben Duncan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693ffa7cffda006548c7e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bishop","original_name":"John Bishop","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/tooZmoOa6YLZTyak8gbbYXFeile.jpg","credit_id":"62694056f9253216228ae89e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8453414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":690,"name":"gorilla"},{"id":2521,"name":"congo"},{"id":211143,"name":"conservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
