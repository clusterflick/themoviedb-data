A longtime fan of Maddin, Losier (best known for other inventive portraits of underground film icons like Tony Conrad and George Kuchar) hoped to document him as well; \"I hate my voice and face,\" Maddin replied, and sent her Super-8 footage of his hands instead. Losier interwove the footage into her own distinct tale, shot like a surrealist 1920s silent film. A must for fans of Losier, Maddin and ingenious cinema in general, MANUELLE LABOR was completed for the Berlin Film Festival (where Maddin was the guest of honor). - Jason Sanders  A collaboration film by Marie Losier and Guy Maddin. Two sisters, five brothers, a doctor and two nurses and the miraculous birth of a pair of hands, but whose hands?","popularity":0.1869,"poster_path":"/u7N0uNAvykgPyRpSPCfcis9YFDZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuelle Labor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":189883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana Francis","original_name":"Juliana Francis","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"577968279251416d4900045d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Losier","original_name":"Marie Losier","popularity":0.2863,"profile_path":"/4dwd7fUTjHyPZJ9eDZmxVfrdUlI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57796831c3a368790a000cac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Maddin","original_name":"Guy Maddin","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/hF15rfnugsLQJfa6R1AvVAX7bEu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"577968379251416d49000461","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Losier","original_name":"Marie Losier","popularity":0.2863,"profile_path":"/4dwd7fUTjHyPZJ9eDZmxVfrdUlI.jpg","credit_id":"577967fac3a3681f5d000850","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1958759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Billyou","original_name":"Mary Billyou","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a1c018f16bac1ac7617ff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1553031","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7N0uNAvykgPyRpSPCfcis9YFDZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":888}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
