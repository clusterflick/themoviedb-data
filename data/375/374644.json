If it had not been for the initiative of several determined women, perhaps there would not have been any August 1980 in Polish history. Under martial law, with the men in prisons, the women took on their role. They were not interested neither in joining the union’s power structure, nor in particular posts. The most important thing was their work and its results. When communism in Poland came to an end on June 4, 1989, the vast majority of women in Solidarity disappeared from the political stage. They let themselves be forgotten when their colleagues were taking over the most important posts in power in a free Poland. This documentary by Marta Dzido and Piotr Śliwowski reminds us about these forgotten heroines, giving us a new perspective on the last 30 years of Polish history.","popularity":0.5359,"poster_path":"/jzbRPaCP3lHAziI4fgW54P2Z48d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emotikonfilm Piotr Śliwowski","origin_country":""},{"id":54245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silesia Film","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2014-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solidarity According To Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piotr Śliwowski","original_name":"Piotr Śliwowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568147e8c3a36828f50063a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piotr Śliwowski","original_name":"Piotr Śliwowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568147c29251417ddd010a67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554832,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marta Dzido","original_name":"Marta Dzido","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568147d8c3a36828f5006394","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554832,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marta Dzido","original_name":"Marta Dzido","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568147a9c3a3684be301107c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554834,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maria Holka","original_name":"Maria Holka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568147f89251417ddd010a6f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554836,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michał Wiśniowski","original_name":"Michał Wiśniowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568148179251417def011072","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piotr Śliwowski","original_name":"Piotr Śliwowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568148259251414ecb00217f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554835,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Magdalena Mosiewicz","original_name":"Magdalena Mosiewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568148099251417ddd010a76","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/jzbRPaCP3lHAziI4fgW54P2Z48d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1577,"name":"solidarity"},{"id":21747,"name":"poland"},{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":190638,"name":"workers union"},{"id":265582,"name":"women empowerment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Solidarity according to women  - trailer","key":"mXhq4EXilQc","published_at":"2014-12-01T11:32:58.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"568149399251414f63009ccb"}]}}}
