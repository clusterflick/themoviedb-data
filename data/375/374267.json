On reaching Le Cateau on 25th Aug Smith- Dorrien realized he would have to stand and fight if his Corps was not going to be picked of piecemeal by the Germans. This film follows the fortunes of II Corps on the 26th Aug as they faced the 12 Divisions of the 1st German Army. Once again the skill, bravery and training of the officers and men off II Corps were able to delay the Germans for long enough to allow them to withdraw as a formed force and live to fight another day.  Not a victory but a success. The Old Contemptibles lived to fight another day.","popularity":0.0748,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Cateau","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"567eb3949251412e520080a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Peters","original_name":"Mike Peters","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"567eb3d0c3a368227b0003ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter and Director","credit_id":"567eb4449251414f630031ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Oldfield","original_name":"Paul Oldfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"567eb5adc3a368607500824b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter and Producer","credit_id":"567eb5c99251417ddd00a61c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Church","original_name":"Ed Church","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter and Living Historian","credit_id":"567eb5e99251412e520080f8","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
