Examining the arduous work of assessing and documenting the geographical landscape, including sampling and analysis of soil, forestry, timber, wildlife, resources, industrial sites, and many other aspects, we see that human beings alone couldn't handle the vast amount of information that is collected. A new kind of computer (an “instant library”), the Canada Land Inventory Geo-information System, was developed to help manage and develop Canadian land. This film examines the workings of this new and mysterious machine.","popularity":0.4467,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Data for Decision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":190417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gilbert","original_name":"Richard Gilbert","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"567edbba9251417def00aa54","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343449,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Duckworth","original_name":"Martin Duckworth","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5e757b04228009024bf1a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Lipsett","original_name":"Arthur Lipsett","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/uL09XjFi6fMHC0VhFZvIhOgVtN5.jpg","credit_id":"567edb11c3a3684be300ab84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Millar","original_name":"David Millar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567edab392514132db008312","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Lipsett","original_name":"Arthur Lipsett","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/uL09XjFi6fMHC0VhFZvIhOgVtN5.jpg","credit_id":"567edb6e92514132db008331","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidney Goldsmith","original_name":"Sidney Goldsmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580992c4c3a3681b2100469b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4729516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6104,"name":"computer"},{"id":213188,"name":"database"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
