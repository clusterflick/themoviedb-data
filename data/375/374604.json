Already overwhelmed by personal problems, he decides to throw himself out the window. He is stopped in his tracks by his next-door neighbor who suggests an unexpected plan to keep his job: pretend to be a homosexual. Assuming that in this age of political correctness, one does not fire a gay man, he manages to convince Pignon to play along while remaining a discreet and shy little man... What will change is the way others look at him. Pignon will thus benefit from an unusual reintegration by coming out of a closet where he had never entered.","popularity":0.4832,"poster_path":"/t25ohg4xT2tcZrxbMHptCVNt5IC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Placard","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élie Semoun","original_name":"Élie Semoun","popularity":0.7603,"profile_path":"/gjJpIq92ubeKgAAvK6yexZycIlv.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"François Pignon","credit_id":"56810656c3a36860e900f8df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Gamelon","original_name":"Laurent Gamelon","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/bHOyUmPTZIQah63jPct2IdaxYpW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Felix Santini","credit_id":"568106639251414f630091db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Magnan","original_name":"Philippe Magnan","popularity":0.1879,"profile_path":"/xwOB9jsFn3koHGuLiWuTou0tnrE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5681066fc3a368227b005ea6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoé Félix","original_name":"Zoé Félix","popularity":0.2444,"profile_path":"/ftOyA1t6EPSxlOQVBD0v2opqFXd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5681067dc3a3682abc008e1b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Levantal","original_name":"François Levantal","popularity":0.2792,"profile_path":"/gKZUbm7NIQbAOQmncBIegE6VOcf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56810688c3a36828f5005911","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Paolini","original_name":"Laurent Paolini","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56810691c3a36860e900f90a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1267410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Facundo","original_name":"Marie Facundo","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/eLE0ZhNPySr97Qm84THo9DSO4Qw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"568106a0c3a3684bcc010cf3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Thiel","original_name":"Dominique Thiel","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/d41GXFjFOo8xrDV1InafheTLQYt.jpg","credit_id":"5d00306e92514162bcbb05bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francis Veber","original_name":"Francis Veber","popularity":0.1963,"profile_path":"/tz0Rm7SgvhIIxPUve9mqSfvLEvH.jpg","credit_id":"66f057ffc237258e4c2654c0","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francis Veber","original_name":"Francis Veber","popularity":0.1963,"profile_path":"/tz0Rm7SgvhIIxPUve9mqSfvLEvH.jpg","credit_id":"66f05805c237258e4c2654d4","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francis Veber","original_name":"Francis Veber","popularity":0.1963,"profile_path":"/tz0Rm7SgvhIIxPUve9mqSfvLEvH.jpg","credit_id":"66f058106c3b7a8d648d8bf5","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4720444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/t25ohg4xT2tcZrxbMHptCVNt5IC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"},{"id":14522,"name":"co-workers relationship"},{"id":249749,"name":"pretending to be gay"},{"id":284103,"name":"theatre"},{"id":285695,"name":"theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"D8","release_date":"2015-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
