At Barcelona’s Gran Teatre del Liceu David Alden’s visually sumptuous production, with its suggestions of a giant game of chess, puts the opera’s potent blend of sex and politics in a context that sets ancient against modern– just as the action juxtaposes scurrilous comedy and stark drama. Monteverdi’s magnificent score, meanwhile, accommodates intrigue, wit, nobility, tragedy and sensuality, and, led by the intense Sarah Connolly and the delectable Miah Persson, the cast brings both drama and music startlingly to life.","popularity":0.5092,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'incoronazione di Poppea","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Connolly","original_name":"Sarah Connolly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sZR6Pua1rScNitMsPOmINZ4If4F.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nerone","credit_id":"5681302a9251414ecb001d78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miah Persson","original_name":"Miah Persson","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/syEnXE1dqEWWdwLpoUM31WgDNd5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Poppea","credit_id":"56813035c3a36828f5005f49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz-Josef Selig","original_name":"Franz-Josef Selig","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/lHT4IYTVLbQiqud8TPI9ci2ssnm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Seneca","credit_id":"5681305c9251414ecb001d7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy De Mey","original_name":"Guy De Mey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lucano","credit_id":"5681306e9251412e5200e76e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordi Domènech","original_name":"Jordi Domènech","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ottone","credit_id":"5681309992514132db00e3b4","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":1405,"name":"roman empire"},{"id":15160,"name":"divorce"},{"id":196307,"name":"nero"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
