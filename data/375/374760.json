One stormy night a sudden, shattering collision takes an innocent life. Now seven people find their paths intertwined by the accident and hard questions reflected in their own lives. Why do such tragedies occur? If God is good, why does He allow so much pain?  As each of them struggle through the aftermath, threads of hope and faith and the support of close friends become the lifeline to a strength they could never find alone. Nationally esteemed pastor and author Bob Russell is featured as himself in a powerfully dramatic film that brings his teachings to vivid life.","popularity":0.2763,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acts of God","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":198832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esperanza Catubig","original_name":"Esperanza Catubig","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"56a1764dc3a36834130069c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":215426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance Brenneman","original_name":"Constance Brenneman","popularity":0.1625,"profile_path":"/9UuQhiB4N1pfyAweIJKxx1HWuXT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tracy","credit_id":"56a176629251412ec7008536","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan DragonKing","original_name":"Jordan DragonKing","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"David","credit_id":"56a1767792514149bc0080e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":962148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenda Benward","original_name":"Kenda Benward","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rita","credit_id":"56a1768a9251413849007fac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Boland","original_name":"Lydia Boland","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Becca","credit_id":"56a176a4c3a36858c800f6fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelo Perez","original_name":"Angelo Perez","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Hector","credit_id":"56a176b992514137d6007ed7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1502244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Morgado","original_name":"Doris Morgado","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/g2qQLzvqK0kRjlMjAQ56eDKjoUO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Afghan Woman","credit_id":"56a176dbc3a36858c6010c8c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Mann","original_name":"Amelia Mann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Orphan","credit_id":"56a17963c3a36858e5010e2d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shane Sooter","original_name":"Shane Sooter","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a17615925141370b0081d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shane Sooter","original_name":"Shane Sooter","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a17624c3a36858e5010d12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ninie Hammon","original_name":"Ninie Hammon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a176369251415e6700f97d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2808733,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Bryan","original_name":"Kevin Bryan","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ea68c0b5fd60162383b18","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4634090,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jared Hardy","original_name":"Jared Hardy","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ea69195ce2401646f2879","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2516990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
