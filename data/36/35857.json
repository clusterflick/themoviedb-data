His mother Evelyn, a laundress who is stubborn, ornery, opinionated, mean-spirited, insulting, and inflexible, has sent a ten-year-old boy who says he's Sheldon's son up to see Sheldon. Sheldon comes home to straighten things out. Old arguments flare up - between mother and son and between brothers. Sheldon wants no part of fatherhood or family. Then, someone else from New York shows up at Evelyn's door, bringing a new set of challenges. Will this family ever stop airing its dirty laundry? And what of Sheldon: where is his pride? Can he, in the words of James Baldwin, go where his blood beats and live the life he has?","popularity":2.1277,"poster_path":"/ap8DgXrDAREiotVB1gbd2vnB95U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5578,"logo_path":null,"name":"MoJAM Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirty Laundry","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rockmond Dunbar","original_name":"Rockmond Dunbar","popularity":1.4579,"profile_path":"/gim7zIrYkbKWsp2Kod7fp74fWyI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Patrick / Sheldon","credit_id":"52fe45ba9251416c9103c69b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loretta Devine","original_name":"Loretta Devine","popularity":2.044,"profile_path":"/cGTQ0X19bkMWqL6O00JK2t6uJBK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Evelyn","credit_id":"52fe45ba9251416c9103c69f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenifer Lewis","original_name":"Jenifer Lewis","popularity":1.325,"profile_path":"/bdeUHXY4cXvhOW2nCblNachBYsM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aunt Lettuce","credit_id":"52fe45ba9251416c9103c6a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terri J.
