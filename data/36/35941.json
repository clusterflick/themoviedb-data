Schechter exposes the hidden financial and political complex that allows the lowest wage earners to indebt themselves so heavily that even house repossessions are commonplace.","popularity":0.5121,"poster_path":"/mkNstijW0pkd8hr6fDtQBFnnrI3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Debt We Trust: America Before the Bubble Bursts","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"In Debt We Trust","type":"short title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Schechter","original_name":"Danny Schechter","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cda971c3a3680a3f00114e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073307,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Glenn Beatty","original_name":"Glenn Beatty","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6736a7d3d4ffba1e8b2b0b4a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0829429","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bLFD59DibkIZ6TfbAbCFffopEdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mkNstijW0pkd8hr6fDtQBFnnrI3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6zuq4SkCl8S1JcvuZ87GbVjOTj6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6126,"name":"banking"},{"id":11061,"name":"debt"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":188950,"name":"corporation"},{"id":207458,"name":"national debt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
