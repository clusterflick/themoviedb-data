It is a film which highlights values like freedom, fun, friendship, and unity, rather than the riders' technical skills, all in a magnificent scenery where Mother Nature has the leading role. A cinematic feeling has been produced with the introduction of an unusually unique soundtrack, producing a perfect symbiosis between the original filming sounds and the music. While acting as editors, riders, cameramen, sherpa porters, and so on, six Italian friends have conceived, planned, and created a real-life film which remains closer to the everyday rider and his lifestyle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magmatic Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clorophilla","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q5135147","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
