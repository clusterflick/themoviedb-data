Corti's unhappy fate, the last, unlucky CEO at the traditional airline company, as well as of all those nameless people who lost almost everything in the maelstrom of Swissair's downfall: their job, home and their belief in Switzerland.","popularity":0.4576,"poster_path":"/rmRkwXxqXUSFUVMlPr6uc78Evir.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6663,"logo_path":"/gVL9spqQwwCQPly6moVVWuofouy.png","name":"C-Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2006-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grounding: The Last Days of Swissair","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Grounding - Gli ultimi giorni di Swissair","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László I.
