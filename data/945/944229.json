Vacationing yachtsman Bob Winthrop and Ruth fall in love, but Winthrop returns to New York, and after a year, has forgotten Ruth. After finding two chests in a cave, Ruth locates her father unconscious from a fall. She goes to the mainland for help, but returns with the Reverend Josiah Arbuthnot and Dr. William Strong, to find her father dead. Strong, out of kindness, offers to marry her, but Ruth declines, sure that Winthrop will return.","popularity":0.3606,"poster_path":"/zzQs4nOMpMw8BJRGsac62ok166F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perfection Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awakening of Ruth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Mason","original_name":"Shirley Mason","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/mtz8dvcq9n2f72hsgZWDCLyExpZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Hoagland","credit_id":"621bb7aaa9117f001cad7d0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George J.
