When she arrived, she was greeted coldly, compelled to perform menial services, and treated more like a servant than a relation. Naturally, she was very unhappy. About this time the family was thrown into excitement by the news that the father's old chum in college, who had gone to Australia to make a fortune, had returned, with $1,000,000, and intended to marry and settle down.
