The film honours the past and the iconic Thom McGinty, the Diceman, who was one of the first to speak openly in Ireland about having AIDS but, other than that, it’s very firmly rooted in the here and now. Based on a theatre show, the stories in this film move between bodies of young men, migrant women, drag artists and activists. A form-flipping documentary, it features a cast of actors as well as ordinary people coming out on screen for the first time.","popularity":0.4327,"poster_path":"/bLFeaZea8orhrZnw9OUAgqblvnK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92641,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invisible Thread Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Tell a Secret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Dunne","original_name":"Shaun Dunne","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/mZDNCFaDtGpSFT9CkoqyhbkpmLw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621d7f415800c4004560d661","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1608146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Jane Gaffney","original_name":"Eva-Jane Gaffney","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/fPcjGQNnvgD8TvAuwxZleVRNsfo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621d7f49eea34d001b07dc05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2330638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jade Jordan","original_name":"Jade Jordan","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/2sBI7xd5YFzIP0RgSpLzHYPwflI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621d7f51f12cf4001b7bfb41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Larkin","original_name":"Lauren Larkin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621d7f7f5800c4001dca4283","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie Lawlor","original_name":"Robbie Lawlor","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621d7f84cee481001db31330","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lady Veda","original_name":"Lady Veda","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621d7f8c54f6eb00705b94f4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Dunne","original_name":"Shaun Dunne","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/mZDNCFaDtGpSFT9CkoqyhbkpmLw.jpg","credit_id":"621d7f06e9da69006e3f1507","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1069376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Rodgers","original_name":"Anna Rodgers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621d7f13cee48100456cc7de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18258632","wikidata_id":"Q124618309","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kXkBjDqkBjEfKY3M2zNSHNYmV8e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":759,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bLFeaZea8orhrZnw9OUAgqblvnK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eWvTXN4nCefjJHwQTjPPfvefqHf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1862,"name":"coming out"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Netflix","release_date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docs Ireland","release_date":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Pride Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Frameline Film Festival, San Francisco, CA","release_date":"2023-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How To Tell A Secret – Original trailer","key":"mLAhCo8LqPo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-24T08:48:58.000Z","id":"641cfa0f344a8e00f876c657"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How To Tell A Secret (cinema trailer)","key":"xvrLM2hOUCY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-03T13:05:02.000Z","id":"641cfa09e0ec51008154c2a6"}]}}}
