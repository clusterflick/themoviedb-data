He protected and looked after his flowers, providing them with “love and gentle care.” He took great pride in his work and, as a result of his labor, felt “filled with purpose” and “close to God.” However, Jan’s love and adoration of the flowers transforms into a distortion of his power, as he becomes jealous of the flowers bowing “under the intense authority of the sun.” Jan’s body reflects this internal transformation, and he becomes a looming totalitarian figure demanding the obedience of his flowers. When he realizes that his shadow can block the sun, the flowers rebel and twist around his body, drawing him into the earth. The next morning, the sun comes out, and a “sparking and sweet smell” (perhaps Jan’s body transformed into metaphorical fertilizer) mixes with the natural perfume of the flowers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4Kzt7nN9ARW7HH5J13vuUMdzvwU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117397,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldsholl & Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rebellion of the Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shepard Strudwick","original_name":"Shepard Strudwick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"621b896027d9cc001bc52f9b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2293786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Millie Goldsholl","original_name":"Millie Goldsholl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b894d858678001fc4f202","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2293786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Millie Goldsholl","original_name":"Millie Goldsholl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b89aaa5743d001e6d17e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugh Valentine","original_name":"Hugh Valentine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b89ca158c850043b8d803","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197546,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nick Kolias","original_name":"Nick Kolias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b89ec176a9400438fd1f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2293786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Millie Goldsholl","original_name":"Millie Goldsholl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b89f68586780043a01b53","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Kzt7nN9ARW7HH5J13vuUMdzvwU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
