He is unhappy because Hank (the rabbit) seems to be losing his former good health. When Willie tries to obtain assistance from his family, he quickly discovers that he has chosen the wrong time, for his father is feeling bad himself, and has no sympathy to waste on rabbits. A doctor is also hard-hearted. Willie is sent to the drug store to fill a prescription for his father, and he decided to see if the medicine will not cure the rabbit. To hide his wrongdoing from his parents, Willie fills the bottle with water. In the meantime the druggist has discovered that he has made an awful mistake, and put poison in the dose.","popularity":0.145,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pa's Medicine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Nichols Jr.","original_name":"George Nichols Jr.","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Willie, the Little Boy","credit_id":"621d36cff12cf40043f0c323","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Willie's Father","credit_id":"621d36e16b5fc20042de2ed9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Willie's Mother","credit_id":"621d36f12b8a43004452ce36","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"621d36ff902012001bca880b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nichols","original_name":"George Nichols","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/ghGlmpjdUDRShrGZyG92sm3m5Hx.jpg","credit_id":"621d36b15800c400455fb190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174217,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lloyd Lonergan","original_name":"Lloyd Lonergan","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/yUXJjlZsPNSpFPtbrEWVKw9vloX.jpg","credit_id":"621d36bb6b5fc20042de2e57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417037","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
