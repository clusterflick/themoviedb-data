In different parts of the province, people from all ages and walks of life come together to do whatever it takes to help toads survive. They stop road traffic, collect toads in buckets and carry them across the road, build toad tunnels. In the Kootenays, Debbie Pitaoulis is fighting to protect the toad habitat from logging.  The film follows these individualsâ€™ passion for the natural world, their fighting spirit, perseverance but also their struggles, demonstrating that people do not need to be environmental activists or scientists to take action, they just need to be citizens who care.","popularity":0.3605,"poster_path":"/cZRN5fEkMhk7llh89veuwvPFgiA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toad People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Clegg","original_name":"Steve Clegg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"621d093754f6eb007059c9a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Pitaoulis","original_name":"Debbie Pitaoulis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"621d09539020120043b157f9","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1769,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cZRN5fEkMhk7llh89veuwvPFgiA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"},{"id":208647,"name":"activist"},{"id":215522,"name":"british columbia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
