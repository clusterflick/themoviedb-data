The Nazi regime seeks to establish itself in the United States. Operating in the shadows, Nazi spies have infiltrated Hollywood and the studios, spreading their ideology and preparing to take over. Leon Lewis, a Jewish lawyer who sees the growing threat, stands in the way. With few resources, he sets up a spy ring to dismantle the Nazi groups and expose the plot. Blending archival footage and animation, this documentary depicts the unsung story of an ordinary hero who foresaw and corrected his country's fate before it was too late.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/coLk3sWhglwimcHEeOXfL1oPAUh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leon Lewis: A Hollywood Spy Against the Nazis","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2258780,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olivier Mirguet","original_name":"Olivier Mirguet","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ba991a9117f0044b2ce5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Masi","original_name":"Bruno Masi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ba99ea9117f001cad4aff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23831248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/coLk3sWhglwimcHEeOXfL1oPAUh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4PKWIY5M56tN31oMHlFiWx6nAO4.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
