On 10 May, the German Army invaded Holland and Belgium. The Blitzkrieg had begun, an entirely new way of fighting war. For the young men aged 18 and 19 who joined up to 'do their bit', it was a terrifying baptism of fire, and for the British Army a shattering blow. Within three weeks, it was a crushing defeat, leading to the largest military evacuation in history.  This film is the story, told in their own words, of a group of young men, now veterans, and their first experience of modern mechanised warfare.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/jP7hnWRYeG6frXIUiI44ApBXdaJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dunkirk: The Soldier's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jP7hnWRYeG6frXIUiI44ApBXdaJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
