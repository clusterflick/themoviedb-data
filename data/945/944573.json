With him resided his two nieces, whom he had taken from their drunken, worthless father when they were of a tender age. Jess, the elder, was brilliant and educated; Bess, the younger was beautiful, but frankly admitted that she did not possess the mental attainments of Jess. The two were great friends, and Jess, although the senior by only three years, had almost a motherly affection for her pretty little sister. Croft, finding old age stealing upon him, advertised for a partner, stipulating that he must be a gentleman. Probably it was his secret idea that the right man might come along, and fall in love with his favorite, beautiful Bessie.","popularity":0.2613,"poster_path":"/kWDRTAzfUXhvUAwt5OIUZspb4RA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1912-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jess","credit_id":"621d0e67e7c09700436ad986","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence La Badie","original_name":"Florence La Badie","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/7vb4YEwmvKQoYgTtq4UvbzvOaME.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jess's Sister, Bess","credit_id":"621d0e755800c400455f231f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Captain John Neil","credit_id":"621d0e822b8a43006edcc975","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Frank Muller, the Treacherous Boer","credit_id":"621d0e917719d7006d9ad2b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Garwood","original_name":"William Garwood","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/sFq3FeCnxyEbbNkfnueRbZLDyD8.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Lawyer","credit_id":"621d0e9e6b5fc20042dda7aa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1472412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Darnell","original_name":"Jean Darnell","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Doctor's Sister","credit_id":"621d0eb3cee48100456b29d6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Marks","original_name":"Harry Marks","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"621d0ebc54f6eb007059dad3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Spear","original_name":"Harry Spear","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/cai6t0K01PQ6ASlwc3WqdOmAmez.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"621d0ec57719d7006d9ad30a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174217,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lloyd Lonergan","original_name":"Lloyd Lonergan","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/yUXJjlZsPNSpFPtbrEWVKw9vloX.jpg","credit_id":"621d0e57e7c09700436ad974","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.
