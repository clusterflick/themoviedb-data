Every day, rag-and-bone man Willem Slootkant takes his cargo bike to go out and look for usable waste in other people's garbage. One day, to his surprise, he finds a baby. Slootkant takes the baby to his mother, who happens to desperately want a grandchild from her unmarried son. They both assume that the child was a junkie's, but when Child Protection is alerted, it turns out the baby has very decent parents. The baby's older brother, meanwhile, feels neglected because of all the panic over the little one.","popularity":0.2796,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Baby and the Cargo Bike","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edo Brunner","original_name":"Edo Brunner","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/6LVLqN1I47UyemA5okgoF19j8go.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Willem Slootkant","credit_id":"621e59318a88b2006dd3d4de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjan Luif","original_name":"Marjan Luif","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/4XHBIHst12OD8dcl0bFX6zhAocl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Liesbeth","credit_id":"621e59616b5fc2006b992506","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margôt Ros","original_name":"Margôt Ros","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/yvQ5WFKsBUSDn1caDf8OvJQUSeC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"621e598d058224004291f2ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Porgy Franssen","original_name":"Porgy Franssen","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/2KzAHpZV1mfQrd5VIE2sgit8lxM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anton","credit_id":"621e59a0cee48100456f10a6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lodewijk Crijns","original_name":"Lodewijk Crijns","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/u1RNWTBlkBMjmsyEhO4VNF69l7K.jpg","credit_id":"621e59ce7719d70044f0f56f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307423,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Menno Westendorp","original_name":"Menno Westendorp","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621e5a14d38b580042bfce6a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0118666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
