It is a period piece featuring housewife Marcia, whose whimsical notions about dust and dirt take a dark turn when she encounters Mucor, the god of decay. Itâ€™s a story about art, metaphysics, obsessive compulsion and second wave feminism. Told through a fascinating character, an ingenious but profoundly conflicted individual, who comes unstuck amid the transformation of gender rules in 1970s suburban London.","popularity":0.1001,"poster_path":"/7sRyVLm0YHKdMIfvHSr5HsBoGtR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166376,"logo_path":"/glnbLuSac2ZQFYGssl1pFVS5PFO.png","name":"Full Spectrum Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Limits of Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Farinha","original_name":"Sarah Farinha","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"636fc01e798e0600914ecb7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Hollimon","original_name":"Greg Hollimon","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/xAWnNN9ynbylAW3bn0minFDc6l4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"636fc373ca4f670082119d9e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Harrison","original_name":"Laura Harrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621e2beaf12cf4001b7dc9ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Irwin","original_name":"Robert Irwin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636fbd57e894a6007f30919c","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1466,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7sRyVLm0YHKdMIfvHSr5HsBoGtR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":977}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"MoMI First Look festival - Persistent Visions program","release_date":"2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"limitstrailer.mp4 (1440p).mp4","key":"682641543","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-28T01:02:08.000Z","id":"636fc39621621b00cd62a7d6"}]}}}
