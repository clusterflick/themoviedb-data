This already special day is made more unusual by the recent arrival of her grandson, Lev, who had immigrated to the United States with his family in 2001. Returning to Ukraine for the first time as an adult, Lev documents his grandmother as she tends to the small homestead and prepares for the birthday celebration in the rural village in Ukraine. By capturing moments of arduous labor, as well as through personal conversation, Lev inquires into his grandmothers relationship to her home, land - and their family.","popularity":0.5804,"poster_path":"/t9GrlhNQ6ecjMspRH65DUXO6pAE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170817,"logo_path":null,"name":"LEVOMEL Productions LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lida","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Лида","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lida Omelchenko","original_name":"Lida Omelchenko","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621da8352b8a430044547107","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3447997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lev Omelchenko","original_name":"Lev Omelchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621dabb89f1be7006b7ed69b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3447997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lev Omelchenko","original_name":"Lev Omelchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621dabc4cee481001db3a981","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3447997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lev Omelchenko","original_name":"Lev Omelchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621da80d902012006d3e2742","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"lidafilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/17IRTqYZ0JrOFYurTJWUN1EiuoS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9GrlhNQ6ecjMspRH65DUXO6pAE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1421,"name":"birthday"},{"id":3023,"name":"eastern europe"},{"id":11332,"name":"farm life"},{"id":9914,"name":"slice of life"},{"id":11004,"name":"rural area"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":190484,"name":"ukrainian village"},{"id":190756,"name":"cinéma vérité"},{"id":260917,"name":"ukrainian culture"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":267659,"name":"grandmother grandson relationship"},{"id":272265,"name":"ukraine"},{"id":285313,"name":"poltava, ukraine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prismatic Ground","release_date":"2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lida - Trailer","key":"387214934","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-26T01:47:04.000Z","id":"621da9256b5fc20042e007db"}]}}}
