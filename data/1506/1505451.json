Based on extensive interviews and utilizing Jim’s own writing this documentary brings together a diverse array of Native American scholars, historians, athletes, and influential sports commentators.  Jim’s unparalleled career, from leading the Carlisle Indian School’s football team to becoming a two-time Olympic gold medalist in 1912, a Hall of Fame NFL legend, and a Major League Baseball player, redefined the possibilities for athletes of all backgrounds. But his triumphs came at a cost, as he battled racism, had his Olympic gold medals stripped away, and faced the harsh realities of America’s unforgiving sports industry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dJDuJVfmTusfxJA6h6z3AZFxrn6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Jim Thorpe: Lit by Lightning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Eyre","original_name":"Chris Eyre","popularity":0.3501,"profile_path":"/tjktPaECE0AFP8faHUbYPBvdgR.jpg","credit_id":"686052203856c386844d199e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31557465","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJDuJVfmTusfxJA6h6z3AZFxrn6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1176}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"History Channel","release_date":"2025-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
