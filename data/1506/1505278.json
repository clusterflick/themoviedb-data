After several years playing in Armenia, he was offered a lucrative job in the capital but chose a different path. Silven settled in the remote village of Teghut, where he now lives a simple, peaceful life, growing vegetables and raising chickens.  Despite financial hardship and cultural differences, Silven has dedicated himself to training local children in football. His dream is to help them become true champions—not only on the field, but in life. He believes success shouldn’t depend on coming from the capital and strives to instill values of discipline, hard work, and hope.  This film is a tribute to Silven’s mission: a man bridging cultures and inspiring a new generation in a quiet Armenian village through the universal language of football.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/EMb2zJao3IMma7Kl59PczhaYzj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silven from Teghut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artak Harutyunyan","original_name":"Artak Harutyunyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wRsuv17fuYBs0NJiTrmMnQr9EWB.jpg","credit_id":"685ffb86e4871021177b456e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5288822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sargis Gyulumyan","original_name":"Sargis Gyulumyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/q6NBf5AQVDfbUGNASoZ67SdGeyZ.jpg","credit_id":"685ffc442df48ef5652292be","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e133Xnb8W7aJTla5azE4255cydQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZyxn6o9ij0IxM7qz23sQREwnbG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mh6EAOGlPXVMcUhC5WA0fGm84MR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/EMb2zJao3IMma7Kl59PczhaYzj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":333328,"name":"sport"},{"id":352822,"name":"football"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
