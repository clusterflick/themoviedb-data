The story follows Kamsi, a young woman who isn’t like other people. She feels everything, literally. Her rare condition forces her to absorb the emotions of everyone around her. But when she falls for Audrey, a magnetic woman harbouring her own mysterious illness, Kamsi’s world fractures in ways she can no longer control.  What begins as a sensual, emotionally intense relationship quickly turns unsettling. Kamsi is haunted by visions, disoriented by feelings that aren’t hers, and drawn deeper into a reality that no longer has clear edges. Audrey’s presence is both intoxicating and corrupting, an emotional virus infecting Kamsi’s already fragile grip on selfhood.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/x39ynpXnysEKuIXVmD3Da7n9tOW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucidum Visions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MT","name":"Malta"}],"release_date":"2025-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some feelings aren’t yours, but they can still destroy you.","title":"Black Feeling","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Grech","original_name":"Bernadette Grech","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Therapist","credit_id":"685ff63067311fcab5debc83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moussa Hammoud","original_name":"Moussa Hammoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Faceless Man","credit_id":"685ff6482dd9cfae14dd0f5b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Zammit","original_name":"Kristina Zammit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kamsi","credit_id":"685ff65756bd33888f3038bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Agius","original_name":"Rachael Agius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Audrey","credit_id":"685ff667c8827b4c39805cae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Holly","original_name":"Billy Holly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jogger","credit_id":"685ff6792df48ef5652292a8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janie Ogeah","original_name":"Janie Ogeah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ff6ebc0b79d9e174d19f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janie Ogeah","original_name":"Janie Ogeah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ff701e4871021177b4539","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janie Ogeah","original_name":"Janie Ogeah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ff7190d2fde4068dd102a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4678512,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Kawula","original_name":"Krzysztof Kawula","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ff738177518583e805ce8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532417,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Franco Rizo","original_name":"Franco Rizo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ff75b94258937da9af058","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37145256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x39ynpXnysEKuIXVmD3Da7n9tOW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222,"name":"schizophrenia"},{"id":3762,"name":"darkness"},{"id":2754,"name":"trauma"},{"id":12565,"name":"psychological thriller"},{"id":13073,"name":"fear"},{"id":256183,"name":"supernatural horror"},{"id":271167,"name":"same sex relationship"},{"id":324429,"name":"romantic"},{"id":348563,"name":"lgbtq+"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Official premier at Eden Cinemas, Malta","release_date":"2025-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
