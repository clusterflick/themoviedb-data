Years after the system closed the file and the world moved on, Lucien uncovers a new clue that pulls him into a series of conversations with someone believed to be connected to the crime.  When a man named John Corwin is brought in for interrogation, Lucien is convinced he's finally closing in on the truth. But their exchange is far from ordinary. Fragmented memories, hazy flashbacks, and cryptic, blood-stained messages begin to collide with Lucien's own beliefs, blurring the line between the truth he seeks and the reality he fears.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xSMwAjVXKAKwgvpKT02sEvYhhhl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kantas Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimas Dandosi","original_name":"Dimas Dandosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lucien Hale","credit_id":"68618838665831e2f0229751","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isyraf Muzhaffar","original_name":"Isyraf Muzhaffar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John Corwin","credit_id":"6861884f96358151a5fdccc1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laksamana N.","original_name":"Laksamana N.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jean Corwell","credit_id":"686188632334bf8c607b4b92","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5535074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzaky Subkhan","original_name":"Dzaky Subkhan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618a3f4f4da68690a4d6ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5535074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzaky Subkhan","original_name":"Dzaky Subkhan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618a51a8da2c8632a4d735","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535075,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irgy Rabbani","original_name":"Irgy Rabbani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618a74fe388730d90d9594","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535077,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Subhan Farizku","original_name":"Subhan Farizku","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618a892bcbb0006c303fac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535078,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Khansa Callista","original_name":"Khansa Callista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618a9cf03c79e6fa7b4f32","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535081,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bryan Farras","original_name":"Bryan Farras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618af29c0ba8566efdcaa7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5535074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzaky Subkhan","original_name":"Dzaky Subkhan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618b0dea01a19b950d9610","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5535084,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Fariz Afaf","original_name":"Fariz Afaf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68618b298481ff3aa50d94f1","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xSMwAjVXKAKwgvpKT02sEvYhhhl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"17+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
