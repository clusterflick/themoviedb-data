His four sons are all among the post-relocation migrants of the Three Gorges Project. After the reservoir began filling in June 2003, most of their mountain land was submerged, making their livelihood a serious concern. This film, spanning a decade, documents the mass relocation of Three Gorges migrants, the historic transformation from deep gorges to wide lakes; it captures the lived experience and emotional upheaval of an old boatman and his descendants amid sweeping change; and it preserves the arduous history and resilient survival spirit of the boatmen of the Three Gorges region.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sSYqEsGe620I0KtvIWUPkSx7THB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236353,"logo_path":"/dTQDUQoRzXcn77bX0EqOrAnPVwL.png","name":"Hubei Radio & Television Station","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boatman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhu Junhua","original_name":"Zhu Junhua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6860374bcd07c7ba010d8f83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yao Songping","original_name":"Yao Songping","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6860377a6419691ae47ed4a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5532856,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Liu Dedong","original_name":"Liu Dedong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686037a86681110865dd1089","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sSYqEsGe620I0KtvIWUPkSx7THB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
