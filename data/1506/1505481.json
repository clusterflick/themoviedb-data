As an audiovisual mosaic of still moving images and sounds adapted from the frames of the narratives of Mambety and Sembene in order to circulate in a migratory orbit that summons the borderless imagination of the cine-Sahel. As morphologies that amplify the Sembenean and Mambetyan motifs of Cinemafricana until they assail the imagination with the expansive deformation, centrifugal contraction, compacted compression and amassed concentration that Stephen Henderson calls ‘Mascon’ or ‘black experiential energy’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mascon: A Massive Concentration Of Black Experiential Energy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mascon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5533151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Otolith Group","original_name":"the Otolith Group’s","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"686067da3eb84debc34d1a97","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5533151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Otolith Group","original_name":"the Otolith Group’s","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6860a948cd07c7ba010d922e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Flaherty Film Seminar 2025","release_date":"2025-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
