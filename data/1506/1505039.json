This rendered them a special target for ISIS, which in 2014 massacred and abducted thousands in Shingal, the largest Yazidi-majority city. Kurdish director Shilan Saadi—beset by her own childhood memories of the Iran–Iraq War—runs a filmmaking workshop for survivors of Shingal, teaching seven teenaged girls to document their lives in a Turkish refugee camp. Bonds are forged and strengthened, but soon fray as one after another departs for Europe. Taking a mixed-media approach to the Yazidi genocide and its aftermath, Saadi and her collaborators produce an uncannily powerful group portrait, each frame a witness to perseverance and haunted by absence. - Josh Martin, Special Programs & Feature Film Programmer, Austin Asian American Film Festival","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night and Fog in Kurdistan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
