The 73-minute performance, featuring classics from Coltrane to Ellington, ends poignantly with two of his most celebrated and powerful compositions: \"Volunteered Slavery\" and \"The Inflated Tear.\"  Seeing him live as a completely different experience from listening to his music on record. Often playing two and three reed instruments simultaneously with amazing skill, he was a living encyclopedia of jazz and an ever-thinking force of energy who swept the audience up into his orbit.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Icons: Rahsaan Roland Kirk Live In France 1972","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
