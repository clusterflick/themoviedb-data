Tondelli is known not only for being one of Europe’s greatest storytellers but also for being one of the sharpest voices of his time. He was the writer of Other Libertines, his first work and a cult novel among young people of the 80s, subject to seizure in L’Aquila for obscenity and outrage against the public morals of the time. Yet, Tondelli’s novel was not only a transgressive writing but also a literary project that allowed the linguistic mixing of registers, sectors and even dialectisms. The film sets out in search of the places where the writer had the opportunity to live, starting from Correggio, where he was born, up to Bologna, the aforementioned L’Aquila, and then Orvieto, on which his second novel focuses, to continue with Rome, Milan, and Berlin.","popularity":0.1801,"poster_path":"/quq5AX9dgq1GVOZZM7LQne9VOli.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solitude, It's That","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenzo Balducci","original_name":"Lorenzo Balducci","popularity":0.1281,"profile_path":"/dxFgIDVZIcatsopanPZrHpZgylV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"651443d20499f200e1c5f5a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1965375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobia De Angelis","original_name":"Tobia De Angelis","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/Ag3G55hwBBHGhrinfrgaPOq26o4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"651443da9b8616011c475707","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Bazzi","original_name":"Jonathan Bazzi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"651443eeea84c700eb97bfab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Bubba","original_name":"Angela Bubba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"651443f5c50ad2010bfc0b03","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Di Grado","original_name":"Viola Di Grado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6514440193bd6900c4dd5cf0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2221290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Di Paolo","original_name":"Paolo Di Paolo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6514440d93bd69011b8bfd47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Durastanti","original_name":"Claudia Durastanti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6514441ac50ad200ad7e9f1e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessio Forgione","original_name":"Alessio Forgione","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65144423a199a60138b72d41","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alcide Pierantozzi","original_name":"Alcide Pierantozzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"651444290499f200fe9841d7","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Adriatico","original_name":"Andrea Adriatico","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651443a393bd6900fe46f438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127006,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Grazia Verasani","original_name":"Grazia Verasani","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6514444aa199a6011b2125b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491561,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefano Casi","original_name":"Stefano Casi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65144459c50ad2014dcbbb89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Adriatico","original_name":"Andrea Adriatico","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6514446393bd6900e12bf72d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7sf8eqPcaSEvxHsD2YwJsjtcT5P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1207,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/quq5AX9dgq1GVOZZM7LQne9VOli.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
