His many performances at the \"Teatro Fonte\" in Yokohama have been preserved with high quality Beta cameras. In addition, the television station NHK has made recordings of many of his theater performances since the premiere of \"The Dead Sea\" in 1985. Together, the Kazuo Ohno Dance Studio and NHK own over one hundred hours of footage. This is complemented by a 1994 film by Daniel Schmid and new 16mm footage of Kazuo Ohno filmed especially for this project in October of 2000. From these resources, this 111 minute Video/DVD was assembled.\r \"Beauty and Strength\" includes dance performances, film excerpts and interviews, examples of Ohno's drawings and writings, as well as biographical information, creating a comprehensive look into the world of Kazuo Ohno's dance.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":"/12nC3Bm0CzO4njyyKgZSNGRvhxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kazuo Ohno: Beauty and Strength","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuo Ohno","original_name":"大野一雄","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/3xZ760OO9kGDXSwznMPDLJN7muz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65133be3344a8e0973ae4a5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsumi Hijikata","original_name":"土方巽","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":"/uvDK1WvB0991qGKbvzjlF2vKN4T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65133bfce1faed011d6021a9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuo Ohno","original_name":"大野一雄","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/3xZ760OO9kGDXSwznMPDLJN7muz.jpg","credit_id":"65133c16e1faed011d6021ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1533,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/12nC3Bm0CzO4njyyKgZSNGRvhxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1022}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7640,"name":"butoh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
