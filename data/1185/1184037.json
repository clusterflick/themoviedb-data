This documentary shows how, as part of a hugely successful public health initiative, the watercourse known as Hobsonâ€™s Conduit has for 250 years diverted a natural spring to provide Cambridge with its main source of drinking water. However, demand is now causing springs to dry up, precious chalk streams to disappear, and the iconic River Cam to be badly degraded. Water companies, regulators, businesses, land owners, consumers and the government have overseen a developing groundwater emergency. Can these groups come together to ensure Cambridge has a reliable water supply without further damaging the environment?","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pure Clean Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Eva","original_name":"Tony Eva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65134819344a8e097005cc23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Eva","original_name":"Tony Eva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651348348a84d200c3deaf51","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Eva","original_name":"Tony Eva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6513483d8a84d20137474aea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266206,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nigel Kinnings","original_name":"Nigel Kinnings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6513484f344a8e096e6ee8bd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3736782,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jamie Yuan","original_name":"Jamie Yuan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6513485d176a94011d2b5f5d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"JUAN RIERA GOMEZ","original_name":"JUAN RIERA GOMEZ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651348748e2ba600e4520206","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Lloyd-Fitt","original_name":"Christine Lloyd-Fitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65134889344a8e096da01100","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Interview","key":"1Mvm1EVqmDI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2024-03-13T16:10:08.000Z","id":"6605660ad7f4650163db8792"}]}}}
