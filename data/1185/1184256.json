Only a few objects, newspaper clippings and diary entries make him present. But Maia would like to know him better, to piece together a complete portrait from the fragments. For this reason, she leaves Argentina, the land of her home, and travels to the West Bank, where her absent parent comes from. But at first she finds only more ruins, the remains of houses destroyed by the Israeli occupiers. As slowly as the calm sea ripples, the author's pilgrimage to her roots turns into an encounter with an entire nation that has been stripped of its home. The shared experience of loss helps her to fill the empty space in her heart.","popularity":0.1343,"poster_path":"/cDvN1fdUNEgme22aUEqHVvlgCHS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209625,"logo_path":null,"name":"RDI Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violeta Quinteros","original_name":"Violeta Quinteros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"651426f80499f2011b0982a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Di Giambatista","original_name":"Marisa Di Giambatista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"651427009b8616011c474e4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Gattás","original_name":"Luis Gattás","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6514270aa199a60138b7253a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sophie França","original_name":"Sophie França","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6514277ca199a60138b7256d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Burd","original_name":"Marcelo Burd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/Ajx0Y0GE0cWtthKzbXl1NwFKpEC.jpg","credit_id":"65142774cadb6b02bc0b5b46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","original_name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651426dfea84c7014ef9cbae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","original_name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65142765cadb6b02bdebc125","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sophie França","original_name":"Sophie França","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65142758cadb6b02bf008032","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","original_name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65142722ea84c700aee7f58b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194957,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrés Perugini","original_name":"Andrés Perugini","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6B0CKf2hEe2jGBp6CbWqW8mqAno.jpg","credit_id":"6548d117532acb011b1027ac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","original_name":"Maia Gattás Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548cfb741a561336884ccc9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Burd","original_name":"Marcelo Burd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/Ajx0Y0GE0cWtthKzbXl1NwFKpEC.jpg","credit_id":"6646240d855bea90f21cba70","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Burd","original_name":"Marcelo Burd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/Ajx0Y0GE0cWtthKzbXl1NwFKpEC.jpg","credit_id":"66462414e328215a0a4502de","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29267991","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1474,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/cDvN1fdUNEgme22aUEqHVvlgCHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1032}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":256359,"name":"west bank (cisjordan)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
