More and more women are answering a spiritual calling to take on the vestments of priesthood and seek equality in the religion they love. These daring women have risked banishment, loss of livelihood, and even excommunication to take part in what the Church calls illicit ordinations. The Vatican has vowed to end this threat to the male hierarchy, even forbidding the mere discussion of female priests. The papacy has reached a time of crisis and the controversy over women's role, and their place in the Church, must be addressed if the Vatican is to have any relevance in the 21st century.","popularity":0.209,"poster_path":"/gLypdWIKQ0x0kZzL7ta8JVHL5Cy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eye Goddess Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The voices of these women must be heard.","title":"Pink Smoke Over the Vatican","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alta Jacko","original_name":"Alta Jacko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a8570499f200c44e699c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Manning","original_name":"Joanna Manning","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a87e9b8616011c47714f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janice Sevré-Duszynska","original_name":"Janice Sevré-Duszynska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a8d80499f200abbd27e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2251351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Bourgeois","original_name":"Roy Bourgeois","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a8e893bd6900e12c1256","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Lengwin","original_name":"Ronald Lengwin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a9191db65d00e31be061","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Kunster","original_name":"Kathleen Kunster","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a941a199a6011b213d87","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Fresen","original_name":"Patricia Fresen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a96c9b861600e24e50dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Rue","original_name":"Victoria Rue","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a98593bd6900fe471114","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridget Mary Meehan","original_name":"Bridget Mary Meehan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6514a9b2bdd568010046c98a","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3359963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Hart","original_name":"Jules Hart","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6514aa76cadb6b02bdebe2a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1664776","wikidata_id":"Q404122","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLypdWIKQ0x0kZzL7ta8JVHL5Cy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":157008,"name":"roman catholic church"},{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Beloit International Film Festival","release_date":"2011-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Popcorn & Politics Film Series at the LEPOCO Peace Center","release_date":"2012-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PInk Smoke Over The Vatican trailer","key":"VOJYlK4kefA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-09-24T17:56:18.000Z","id":"6514a83c1db65d00e31be02e"}]}}}
