How has architecture been instrumentalized in the ongoing construction of a national narrative? What is the role of architects in shaping society within corrupt ecologies of power and failed financial engineering? Film becomes a plastic medium to reframe the positivism of urban masterplans and architectural monuments and formulate a social critique. Modern structures under threat of collapse stand in as protagonists to tell the story of a promised metropolis that never came to be, while the fairground acts as a lens to look at implicit collapse beyond the perimeter of the site.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/jqamWEm7RwwuDxgUinR972FT8QF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Remain in the No Longer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295840,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rayane Karouta","original_name":"Rayane Karouta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af50cadb6b02bc0be511","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elia el Haddad","original_name":"Elia el Haddad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af4393bd6900e12c872e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kayla Fragman","original_name":"Kayla Fragman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af6f1db65d0100ac9915","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joyce Joumaa","original_name":"Joyce Joumaa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af1f93bd6900fe47902f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586780,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William Albu","original_name":"William Albu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af33d4653701001b0a5d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mohammad Tartoussi","original_name":"Mohammad Tartoussi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af611db65d013b44d5a4","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Bédard","original_name":"Antoine Bédard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af7f93bd690138fc5fe1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":948,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fqP2A41tMkezZpoyBaHQXGwT7yz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1686}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jqamWEm7RwwuDxgUinR972FT8QF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer كیف لا نغرق في السراب / To Remain in the No Longer a film by Joyce Joumaa","key":"4CUGnyhlLWY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-09T14:24:23.000Z","id":"6515b06f1db65d00c6948ec4"}]}}}
