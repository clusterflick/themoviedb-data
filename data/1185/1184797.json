His intention was to raise awareness of pollution in the Hudson River and to petition legislation that addressed the then-burgeoning climate crisis. Over 50 years later, the Clearwater remains an interactive environmental classroom—or, in its builder’s words, “a carnival, museum, and showboat all wrapped into one.” Featuring rare interviews with Seeger himself, Down by the Riverside is a beautiful, stirring tribute to the communities of people who continue to restore and preserve this elegant symbol of the Hudson Valley. As a local story of local heroism, this documentary is an inspiring reminder of all that can be accomplished when ordinary people work on behalf of their history and environment. —Ben Rendich","popularity":0.2215,"poster_path":"/rZ2f64sQi0AAZtGnECzF7TL7jte.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kew Ten","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They built a boat and launched a movement","title":"Down By The Riverside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Seeger","original_name":"Pete Seeger","popularity":0.2224,"profile_path":"/m7WBBJ4Uxl0RA5qHucY159shKLU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6515af390499f200e1c67ecb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshi Seeger","original_name":"Toshi Seeger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6515af3fa199a600e1fade57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Collier","original_name":"Jimmy Collier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6515af4a93bd69011b8c8be8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Bok","original_name":"Gordon Bok","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6515af51c50ad2014dcc422c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Aunapu","original_name":"Allan Aunapu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6515af59a199a600e1fade6b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jodie Childers","original_name":"Jodie Childers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515af7993bd69011b8c8c06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Messina","original_name":"Dan Messina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515afbb93bd6900fe47906e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jodie Childers","original_name":"Jodie Childers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515b007d4653701001b0a9b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jodie Childers","original_name":"Jodie Childers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515b01e93bd6900e12c8769","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Messina","original_name":"Dan Messina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515b02eea84c7014efa5b7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Messina","original_name":"Dan Messina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515b035a199a600ab17f9da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Messina","original_name":"Dan Messina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515b03f1db65d0100ac9959","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rZ2f64sQi0AAZtGnECzF7TL7jte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"24th Annual Woodstock Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
