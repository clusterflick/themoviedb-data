The government has put in place an ultra-conservative policy which runs counter to the values of the European Union.\r Despite injunctions issued by Brussels, Poland continues to exploit its black gold: coal. In the south-west of the country, Michal is a miner, like his father and grandfather before him. In 2022, 15 miners lost their lives in accidents caused by rock slides or fires. The use of coal makes Poland one of the most polluted states in Europe, and in many areas, the air has become toxic. In winter, the city of Rybnik is shrouded in a thick fog of coal particles that darken the sky and cause serious respiratory illnesses.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vZ3xpExFT9r9KoFpsG0fJgajcJu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poland: A Divided Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3103107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathilde Gautry","original_name":"Mathilde Gautry","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65153084ea84c700ca0621ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Gregorio","original_name":"Lucas Gregorio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515309a93bd6900acc58451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPEnknGMeMbfXseYTsQHlLZd67S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3e10ONYNXggyUnUIhSQuHitPNwb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZ3xpExFT9r9KoFpsG0fJgajcJu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
