The film, directed by the renowned Egyptian film critic Sami Al-Salamoni, reflects his theoretical critique of Hollywood through heavily edited scenes and shots from mainstream motion pictures. Al-Salamoni manages to take the audience through the history of commercialized image production towards a transnational solidarity image production as a response. This film was recovered as a part of a cache of archival films about various aspects of the Palestinian liberation movements that were found in Tokyo and therefore dubbed the “Tokyo Reels.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sami Al-Salamoni","original_name":"Sami Al-Salamoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515858ca199a600ab17ea37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
