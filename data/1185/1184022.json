This moving testimony to the effects his physical evolution has had on his every-day life and dance reveals yet even more strongly that ever-present and life embracing emotions so characteristic of all his previous work. In his appearance in Venice (1999) and a series of performances in his home in Yokohama in 2001, Ohno powerfully demonstrated that his dance embodies life in all its aspects. (Now, though physically immobile), Ohno's very presence continues to exude emotion: it overflows with facial expressions and delicate hand movements; fluid as water and changeable as the sky.  This documentary reveals what dance is truly about. Kazuo has given us something very precious.","popularity":0.114,"poster_path":"/yaEI6ChTYh81nRu30If7iPGBn2X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"“O, King God!”","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuo Ohno","original_name":"大野一雄","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/3xZ760OO9kGDXSwznMPDLJN7muz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"651340b63a4a1200c5abfd95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshito Ohno","original_name":"Yoshito Ohno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iONsCnniPjgQpccOR03Q4oumrtz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"651340c3176a94013a9c98a9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Di Capua","original_name":"Gianni Di Capua","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651340a926dac1010c7741e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1533,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yaEI6ChTYh81nRu30If7iPGBn2X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1022}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
