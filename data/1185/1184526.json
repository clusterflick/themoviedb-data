Ladino was the language of the Sephardic Jews, who were expelled from Spain in 1492. It is a miracle that this language is still spoken, despite the many tragedies throughout the ages. With our film we try to understand this miracle by searching for Ladino-speakers and their culture.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/eueRVIHb6oClGOrgwUKDigRKivo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bushkida - In Search of the Jewish-Spanish Language","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bushkida - In Search of the Jewish-Spanish Language","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alisa Meyuhas-Ginio","original_name":"Alisa Meyuhas-Ginio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65151b7dea84c700ca0618fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliezer Papo","original_name":"Eliezer Papo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65151b85a199a600ab17c5de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avner Perez","original_name":"Avner Perez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65151b8fea84c700eb98089a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldina Quintana","original_name":"Aldina Quintana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65151b96a199a600c49c6b63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Schidlowsky","original_name":"David Schidlowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65151b9fa199a600ab17c5ea","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Schidlowsky","original_name":"David Schidlowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65151ba89b861600e24e8cd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Schidlowsky","original_name":"David Schidlowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65151bb51db65d011d1eb3fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294841,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Schidlowsky","original_name":"David Schidlowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65151bda1db65d00adc64184","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294842,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jaime Cañas Lemesch","original_name":"Jaime Cañas Lemesch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65151beb9b861600acae0aa9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294844,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Teresa Pinheiro","original_name":"Teresa Pinheiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65151bf993bd6900c4dda79a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13913834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eueRVIHb6oClGOrgwUKDigRKivo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bushkida, in search of the Judaeo Spanish language","key":"HCOdPmIpBQc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-28T06:46:04.000Z","id":"65151c6ac50ad2010bfc5ab7"}]}}}
