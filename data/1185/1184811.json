Col. Linda Campbell, an Air Force veteran who grappled with hiding her true self during her service tenure. While the national policy shift towards LGBTQ+ rights marks a progressive era, Linda's personal story serves as a powerful testament to the individual battles fought in the shadows of such policies. Subjected to suspicion, prejudice, and threats from her comrades due to her perceived homosexuality, Linda's resilience remain undeterred. Her unwavering love and commitment to her partner, Nancy Lynchild, culminate in a poignant milestone: their eternal rest together in Willamette National Cemetery. Intertwined with this narrative is the account of Linda's brother, Bob Campbell, who delves into their family's conservative roots, Linda's tumultuous coming out, and the eventual familial reconciliation that showcases the transformative power of love and understanding.","popularity":0.3181,"poster_path":"/uUabEiyEoi3utxjpG9a6KH7snGx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the wake of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repeal, Air Force veteran Lt.
