After World War II, when they were declared Ukrainians by the new Communist regimes in every country where they live, Carpatho-Rusyns in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere became extinct overnight -- and this was their existence for more than 50 years.

This is the story of that revival.","popularity":0.3143,"poster_path":"/cTx3no3DqsdMUFZ9rgeWGjLkmr6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Resurrection of a Nation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Silvestri","original_name":"Maria Silvestri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65147ec5c50ad200ad7eaec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Righetti","original_name":"John Righetti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65147f66ea84c7010c10f9c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11362846","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTx3no3DqsdMUFZ9rgeWGjLkmr6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":323255,"name":"rusyn"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prešov","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"YouTube release","release_date":"2019-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
