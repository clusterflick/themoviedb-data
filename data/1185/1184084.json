Amid the ecological crises of the Anthropocene, Letter to T suggests that despite the disenchantment with and the re-politicisation of the image, we might find radical sources of connection and endurance in nuclearity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1TQ7kbjiDZ8k5yzEXifP3QdHEm7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter to T: In Nuclearity, We Are Connected","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1383465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Zimu","original_name":"Zhang Zimu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651368d39b861600acad3354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1645,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1TQ7kbjiDZ8k5yzEXifP3QdHEm7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1234},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90ieAnX8rHCSoiff6YjYXBQotCy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Monographs 2023 ","release_date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
