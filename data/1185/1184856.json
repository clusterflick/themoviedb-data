From the perspective of a Hongkonger, who is no stranger to housing problems, the documentary follows a group of local grassroots housing advocates, attempting to investigate the crisis, connecting the dots between global and local. Screened with the director’s previous film Beautiful Life, about an Indonesian girl who left her homeland to work as a domestic helper for a financially unstable grassroot family in Hong Kong.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dispute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4296109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fredie Chan","original_name":"Fredie Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515d016c50ad200ad7f3218","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
