Her infectious spirit and uniquely endearing laugh became her signature, filling every room with infectious energy and joy. As a child, Kcey's spirited antics foreshadowed her future strength; she later emerged as a formidable member of the Air Force. Recollections from her mother, father, sister, childhood friend, and a battle buddy capture the essence of Kcey, from her infectious laughter to her cherished moments under the Afghan sunsets. Each memory serves as a testament to a life lived passionately. However, heartbreak strikes when, amid war, a plane crashes, claiming Kcey's life. As they grapple with this devastating loss, her loved ones oscillate between despair and denial, occasionally seeking refuge in work or the numbing embrace of alcohol. Yet, as they collectively mourn, they discover solace in their shared memories of Kcey's radiant spirit.","popularity":0.3053,"poster_path":"/chPc7HxBQiPlVcVl43OrS4uPT40.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""},{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"After a spirited Air Force member tragically dies in a war plane crash in Afghanistan, her heartbroken family and friends navigate their grief, finding solace in shared memories of her infectious joy.","title":"Ruiz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ruiz","original_name":"Michael Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Michael Ruiz","credit_id":"651382840745e100c5ea173b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyhia Ruiz","original_name":"Kyhia Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Kyhia Ruiz","credit_id":"6513828fc50ad2010bfb9e79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Ruiz","original_name":"Maya Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Maya Ruiz","credit_id":"651382a7c50ad2010bfb9ea6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazz Krebs","original_name":"Jazz Krebs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Jazz Krebs","credit_id":"651382b20745e10139c1d406","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tevin Henderson","original_name":"Tevin Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Tevin Henderson","credit_id":"651382bda199a600c49baa47","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6513809e9b8616011c46e2a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6513812f9b861600c5c90d75","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4187781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Birdy Wei-Ting Hung","original_name":"Birdy Wei-Ting Hung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651381410745e100fff25bfa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651380aa0745e100fff25b37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65138136cadb6b02c1cfb3ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651380b6ea84c700ca055c4e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4187781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Birdy Wei-Ting Hung","original_name":"Birdy Wei-Ting Hung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651380fe9b861600acad52d2","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrés Gallegos","original_name":"Andrés Gallegos","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65138121cadb6b02bdeb5c52","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
