An 18-year-old woman finds herself caught in the throes of a great wartime secret â€“ the breaking of the German Enigma code. Her recruitment into the \"Ultra\" program brings her to the heart of Bletchley Park's most clandestine operations, where Alan Turing and his team forge the world's first computer in a bid to crack the ever-changing German codes. Every day, she grapples with the weight of the secret, so profound that even her family is oblivious to her covert role. Meanwhile, she captures the heart of an assertive American soldier and their whirlwind wartime romance culminates in a heartwarming union, facing the challenges of the Official Secrets Act. The soldier, persistent and deeply in love, goes to great lengths, in order to secure her release from the program and to solidify their commitment to one another.","popularity":0.3017,"poster_path":"/AbUzcIkwRo090vZbWVcvza1zAWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a secretive WWII code-breaking hub, a young British woman's allegiance to her country collides with a passionate romance with an American soldier, leading to a transatlantic tale of love, sacrifice, and a family legacy wrapped in wartime secrets.","title":"Decoding Jean: Secrets of WWII","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Smith","original_name":"Pamela Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Pamela Smith","credit_id":"65146460cadb6b02bf0090e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Watters","original_name":"Jean Watters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Jean Watters","credit_id":"6515afc9d4653700ad88d1b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Watters","original_name":"John Watters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"John Watters","credit_id":"6515afdc0499f200e1c67f0a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Watters","original_name":"Robin Watters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Robin Watters","credit_id":"6515afeba199a600c49ca2ee","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338304,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hannah Anderson","original_name":"Hannah Anderson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651463a0cadb6b02bf0090b3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651463ffa199a600ab177e81","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338304,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hannah Anderson","original_name":"Hannah Anderson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6514638dc50ad2010bfc1367","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221001,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isaac Billanfante","original_name":"Isaac Billanfante","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65146429c50ad2010bfc138b","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338304,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hannah Anderson","original_name":"Hannah Anderson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6514638493bd6900fe46fd76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Barbarino","original_name":"Robert Barbarino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65146417bdd56800c7cf0e19","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221001,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isaac Billanfante","original_name":"Isaac Billanfante","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65146439cadb6b02bc0b6b87","department":"Crew","job":"Drone Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
