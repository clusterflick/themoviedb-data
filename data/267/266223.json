In this documentary, Kristi Jacobson profiles her grandfather, the king of kings: Toots Shor of the eponymous restaurant and saloon, which was once the place to be seen in Manhattan.  Edward R. Murrow called Toots Shor the owner of Americaâ€™s greatest saloon. He became the unlikely den-mother to the heroes of America's golden age. Politicians and gangsters, sports heroes and movie stars - Sinatra, Gleason, DiMaggio, Ruth, Costello, Eisenhower, Nixon, Warren - for 30 years, they all found their way to Toots' eponymous saloon on New York's West 51st Street.","popularity":0.2337,"poster_path":"/nijNtIa4vzJaD7Vk0bMdfP2Gcd2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catalyst Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maury Allen","original_name":"Maury Allen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53576224c3a368562100277e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lawrence Brown","original_name":"David Lawrence Brown","popularity":0.3526,"profile_path":"/aQEVuW5IWam68nWajc7ij6xTyoN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5357623fc3a3685621002784","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":263739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Anderson","original_name":"Dave Anderson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"592dd280925141690d000e1a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":638550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristi Jacobson","original_name":"Kristi Jacobson","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53576251c3a36855f20027d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":638550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristi Jacobson","original_name":"Kristi Jacobson","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53576263c3a36856110026b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72210,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Suozzo","original_name":"Mark Suozzo","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/2j2EvAjcDc5Qljw66bDmluuG7Ph.jpg","credit_id":"5357626cc3a36856190026f2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":944538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel B.
