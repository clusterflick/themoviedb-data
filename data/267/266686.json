With footage from some of the world's best races to interviews with Olympians, world champs, rookies, coaches, managers, officials, doctors and even the U.S. Surgeon General, HALF THE ROAD offers a unique insight into the drive, dedication and passion it takes for a female cyclist to thrive despite oppression. Both on and off the bike, the voices and advocates of women's pro cycling take the audience on a journey of enlightenment, depth, strength, love, humor and best of all, change and growth.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/hjrxCPmKAYHuOVX5XH70Hhrn7EE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half the Road: The Passion, Pitfalls & Power of Women's Professional Cycling","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313678,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathryn Bertine","original_name":"Kathryn Bertine","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535ae1cac3a36830b90005f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313678,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathryn Bertine","original_name":"Kathryn Bertine","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535ae1e9c3a36830b00005bf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3226754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hjrxCPmKAYHuOVX5XH70Hhrn7EE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Half The Road: The Passion, Pitfalls & Power Of Women's Professional Cycling Trailer 2013","key":"IafSQfntlhE","published_at":"2014-04-03T02:14:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"535e1208c3a3682273001420"}]}}}
