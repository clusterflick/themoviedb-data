His frankness, buoyancy and good nature soon make him a universal favorite. The only one who does not approve of him is headmaster who loves his job, but is not aware of how dated his own views are and cannot understand the young teacher. Apart from this, Boev comes in into particularly sharp conflict with his colleague and childhood chum Kiril who is consumed by jealousy and the ambition to get promoted quickly.","popularity":0.1547,"poster_path":"/vX93PiX6yC3o1ibg3LHUQc0quKN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana
