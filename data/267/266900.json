In 1988, thousands of activists hold the Food and Drug Administration under siege, demanding speedier drug approval. In 1990 AIDS activists converge on the National Institute of Health, calling for a more equitable clinical trial system and expanded research into new drugs and treatment. Voices From the Front, the first feature-length documentary on AIDS activism in America, makes clear the emotional and political effects of community activism using the voices of those directly engaged. It is a powerful distillation of pictures and words from events organized to change public consciousness, expose the failure of the health care systems, and challenge government inaction and neglect concerning AIDS.","popularity":0.2764,"poster_path":"/vkGJVF5yV6ZnDnLrhwWWE4Jctgz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from the Front","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vito Russo","original_name":"Vito Russo","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/xs3FL7xfnS3cAAR9i5Ncf3WWMgG.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55052493c3a36862e1002286","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Kramer","original_name":"Larry Kramer","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":"/eKmaCgORYTI76Cdz8pbZmp0rRYV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d136f8b0e0a2602a1d48c94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Staley","original_name":"Peter Staley","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d136f98925141580cb91b96","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Elgear","original_name":"Sandra Elgear","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550524a392514174b00021b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robyn Hutt","original_name":"Robyn Hutt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550524ba92514174b600201e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Meieran","original_name":"David Meieran","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550524df9251411db40005b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103220","wikidata_id":"Q116978204","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vkGJVF5yV6ZnDnLrhwWWE4Jctgz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
