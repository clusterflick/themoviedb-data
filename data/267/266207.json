The false testimony of two witnesses, Rand and Hobbs, puts Jim O'Brien in the shadow of the hangman's noose. Martha Courtney, widow of the murdered man and Jim's former sweetheart is convinced he isn't guilty, and promises crooked lawyer Roger Lanning the necklace - which Jim doesn't have - if he can arrange for Jim's escape. Rand and Lanning killed Courtney, but Lanning doesn't know that Rand has the necklace.","popularity":0.6859,"poster_path":"/jkIMvsW1PgcCvxH6W3vIQUMUhpM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10616,"logo_path":null,"name":"M & A Alexander Productions Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Today I Hang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Woolf King","original_name":"Walter Woolf King","popularity":0.2164,"profile_path":"/cmNQqzKqHZAyvkSRnclOOOtuUFN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jim O'Brien","credit_id":"56f9e933c3a3681937000ee5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Barrie","original_name":"Mona Barrie","popularity":0.1353,"profile_path":"/o2Mzqhjq0YISSrnDlByHuhmD1f2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Martha Courtney","credit_id":"56f9e93fc3a3681943000ea1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Farnum","original_name":"William Farnum","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/a2N7jJoXYLHaUFBDMGMuIgqja60.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Warden Burke","credit_id":"56f9e94ac3a368192e000e42","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Woods","original_name":"Harry Woods","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/usSay3yVB6wxsLs3UA94b8CqdzC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Henry Courtney","credit_id":"56f9e9579251414deb000d8b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Craven","original_name":"James Craven","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/mPnb1eL9blOrKW0MuOhNvv0SrxJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Joseph Rand","credit_id":"56f9e9659251414e8e000c48","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Raffetto","original_name":"Michael Raffetto","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Roger Lanning","credit_id":"66b35cdc0d26a7f1a8886994","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3469534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Bernard","original_name":"Sam Bernard","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Slick Pheeney","credit_id":"66b35d2c3139e04832886a0c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Fiske","original_name":"Robert Fiske","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/pfjO3ZB9BHdUbiXtOH7NNfnrTw5.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Det.
