He has a wonderful time, flirting with the girls, breaking up a parade, fighting the police force and falling into the fountain with him, escapes, and with the crowd after him, leaps into the river. Here he rescues a little boy and becomes a hero. He goes home to wife in a bedraggled condition, tells of rescue and is set upon a pedestal. Wife, as a reward, takes him to the movies at night and sees husband flirting and fighting in the fountain, where some enterprising cameraman caught him. That explaining, as she thought, the bedraggled state in which he arrived home, she turns and beats him all the way home.","popularity":0.5066,"poster_path":"/epGrqfpnyMQU6zoPXivd5LYCvF2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Featuring the funniest fat man in the world; he who makes millions laugh.","title":"Fatty at San Diego","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Jealous Husband","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","original_name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","popularity":0.2092,"profile_path":"/p0pR1wMRfRfLWZfdHywQcqph8vp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Fatty","credit_id":"535cdd75c3a36830a9003c95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Allen","original_name":"Phyllis Allen","popularity":0.3441,"profile_path":"/jnu1PUkvqRJIkUcnRjYeFxgwgDR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fatty's Wife","credit_id":"535cdd81c3a36830b9003e34","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minta Durfee","original_name":"Minta Durfee","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/8QgdVcTIocr6xdnD0lxhOBPAfUs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Girl at the Carnival","credit_id":"535cdd8ac3a3683084003d15","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cogley","original_name":"Nick Cogley","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/lbIxmCvhMbjFDne97WFvqAv10KG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Girl at the Carnival's Husband","credit_id":"535cdd93c3a36830a0003bb4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Avery","original_name":"Charles Avery","popularity":0.1172,"profile_path":"/jusDHfvZ1jfzF9wNoeZ3DtIuQrJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Theatre Patron","credit_id":"535cdd9ec3a3683091003bba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Hunn","original_name":"Bert Hunn","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Theatre Patron","credit_id":"535cddb2c3a3683084003d23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Inslee","original_name":"Charles Inslee","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/adYzNqmBzmfGkFppoc8eHn2EHk5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Theatre Patron","credit_id":"535cddbac3a36830a9003c98","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Pearce","original_name":"Peggy Pearce","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":"/16lPF8JoayhlPu6ZluIOv5aecMu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Theatre Patron","credit_id":"535cddc5c3a36830b0003c72","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Gilbert","original_name":"Billy Gilbert","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Theatre Patron / Man on Dock","credit_id":"56fd34169251412c85000b5c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nichols","original_name":"George Nichols","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/ghGlmpjdUDRShrGZyG92sm3m5Hx.jpg","credit_id":"535cddcfc3a36830b0003c76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"535cddd5c3a36830b0003c78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002852","wikidata_id":"Q5438016","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/epGrqfpnyMQU6zoPXivd5LYCvF2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1768,"name":"san diego, california"},{"id":3473,"name":"carnival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
