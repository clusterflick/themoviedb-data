They are only a few days away from the day when they will have to make a decisive choice: what are they going to be, and what is more important, how are they going to live? In the whirlpool of meetings with different people and mainly with three women, the filmmakers are trying to see the future of their main character. His schoolmate Mariana wants to lead him into family life. The pop singer Neli is the very incarnation of adventurism. However, he is most deeply touched by the salesgirl in the near-by coffee shop Tintyava. This is a wordless affair in which each glance exchanged betrays the piercing excitement of impossible love.","popularity":0.1426,"poster_path":"/pPlojBJPeQT6homJsg36zR7N40c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74699,"logo_path":null,"name":"SFS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1972-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy Turns Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Momcheto si otiva","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nevena Kokanova","original_name":"Nevena Kokanova","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/rr3KSLde2VGrTX6nYDTBRWy2DFE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Tinka","credit_id":"5879f214c3a36847e800010d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filip Trifonov","original_name":"Filip Trifonov","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/cWkrT3yr7xa2zgpSp0v1FE5Ro3x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ran","credit_id":"5879f230c3a368494c0000f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1199858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sashka Bratanova","original_name":"Sashka Bratanova","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/xM0FV5a8rexYdQsWzAoJqhAbHLp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mariana","credit_id":"5879f25c9251413ecb000119","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiril Gospodinov","original_name":"Kiril Gospodinov","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/ftWGQ0kff6RXXUGRuHET2OOD1E1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Filip K.
