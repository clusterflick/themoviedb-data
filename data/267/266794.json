His beautiful assistant, a woman who has fallen off the career ladder, is terrorized by him. A job-hunting animation artist gets caught in the world of glitter and glamour of the TV industry. Drugs and promiscuity are omnipresent. The animation artist falls in love with the assistant and his love is returned; together they uncover the true identity of the killer. Murderous Decisions is a special experiment: an interactive zap-movie, leaving it up to the viewer whether they follow the story from the male or female perspective. The movie is one of a kind, actually being two movies aired simutaneously on separate TV channels and allowing the viewer to switch back and forth at will.","popularity":0.3791,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murderous Decisions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Byrne","original_name":"Michael Byrne","popularity":0.6987,"profile_path":"/cWUhkJPdyPFbWAskmTuzgEXYR8X.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Octave","credit_id":"535be6a80e0a264fe1001a8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Mira","original_name":"Brigitte Mira","popularity":0.3219,"profile_path":"/aTscEqH9GSbQDlT7hnKFilvzNkf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Blondell","credit_id":"535be6cf0e0a264fe5001b16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Zacher","original_name":"Rolf Zacher","popularity":0.1966,"profile_path":"/l27WA0N4p3LIhJbR13tvUCwCwL7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Toni","credit_id":"535be6dc0e0a264fe5001b18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Franoszek","original_name":"Nina Franoszek","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/v02QiF18qvPWCXuu7SQ3IrAuLDP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dizzy Blonde","credit_id":"59e9e688c3a36875e2005186","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulus Manker","original_name":"Paulus Manker","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/1QaR8Ez7CAVGSGCIwTUahkfRhOC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Felix","credit_id":"59e9e6989251410c0e0111e2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Hirschbiegel","original_name":"Oliver Hirschbiegel","popularity":0.3992,"profile_path":"/6BcZ54IsaNJ5wBqwV7cVTG0QwCb.jpg","credit_id":"535be68d0e0a264fdb0019f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19725,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tony Grisoni","original_name":"Tony Grisoni","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":"/8uc497G5FsotkL9zQopiC4iLP9k.jpg","credit_id":"67129aef097c3d7760f8c9bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0197711","wikidata_id":"Q1609196","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
