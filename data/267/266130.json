Disney's The American Presidents is a fresh and relevant narrative (developed with a former producer of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report) about the men who led this country through change and the lives they affected, from an early idea of democracy to our first African American President.  Each DVD includes short-form Presidential biographies, era overviews for historical context, and thematic segments such as The Making of the Presidency and We the People. The DVD content is based on National Curriculum Standards and features interviews with political luminaries such as Sam Donaldson, Wesley Clark, Paul Begala, Melissa Harris-Lacewell and many more.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The First Eleven Presidents","title":"Disney's The American Presidents: Revolution and the New Nation & Expansion and Reform","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
