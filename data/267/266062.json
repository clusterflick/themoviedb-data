He just killed the Prime Minister of his country. In order to do so, he had to act as if he was a crazy man, wandering through the city. His life comes back by flashes; his childhood with Tourou when his dream was to become a rain miracle-worker, his adventures with Gladys the eater, and his past as a young member of militia, in the heart of the politic and military conflict in Ivory Coast. All those lives, Run didn't choose them. Every time, he felt in by running from another life. That's the reason why his name's Run.","popularity":0.6925,"poster_path":"/yTfYnBiZcyG8I5aJvyMwvOPbMKq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wassakara
