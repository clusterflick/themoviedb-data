Mickey McGuigan, a lively 73 year old farmer turned writer, has been documenting those around him along the Northern Irish border. The stories may defy logic, but people swear by them. This is a disappearing world of folklore and magic. There's a man who cures ringworm on cows by spitting on them and a woman who can cure sick babies with a piece of string. We'll also meet a healer who claims he can cure cancer. He now has a six month waiting list of hundreds op people hoping for a miracle. This is a cinematic journey through the hidden world of rural Northern Ireland, where anything is possible.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miraculous Tales","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Vernon","original_name":"Daniel Vernon","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5359139d0e0a26068d0098eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3591370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
