In order to save her farm and her family, Juliette is forced into a marriage of convenience with Marcel , a morose and laconic railway worker whom she does not even know. Now that her own life is permanently changed, her sacrifice does not ultimately help her family and with that sorrow added to her lonely existence, she is trapped into remaining married because of social pressures and soon enough, the birth of a child. There must surely be a way out for her at some point, but when and how that will happen seems completely up to fate alone.","popularity":0.4206,"poster_path":"/7gdRUaKgEfneLdrq6TvjtWGMwBa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films
