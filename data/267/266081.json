The first segment, titled \"Last Day\" finds acrimony taking precedent over amenity during a farewell party for an employee who's about to move on. A bride and the priest who's officiating her wedding get an unpleasant surprise after running away together in \"Wedding Night,\" and a woman on the CTA receives a spontaneous gift that transforms her outlook on the world (at least, momentarily) in \"Flowers\". Lastly, a family preparing for a big relocation finds the forces of the universe seemingly aligned against them in \"Move\".","popularity":0.3018,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22109,"logo_path":null,"name":"59 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Better Somewhere Else","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gleeson Connolly","original_name":"John Gleeson Connolly","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/2R13yQj8dfaOtbikJ5CPvsjDxSw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"(as John Gleeson Connolly)","credit_id":"53567245c3a36841de002408","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Clinger","original_name":"Will Clinger","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":"/AtRQEsR5aSqZ64QD1jK7SAYaKAz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Singer","credit_id":"53567256c3a36841ee00247b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Kunz","original_name":"Molly Kunz","popularity":1.6839,"profile_path":"/rChSqdByPn0lvR1dFIZeQGyYNIM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lauren in 'Move'","credit_id":"5356726dc3a36841e500238b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Glynn","original_name":"Molly Glynn","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54106dbb0e0a26124e001b45","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562211,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ron Lazzeretti","original_name":"Ron Lazzeretti","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5356727cc3a36841cf00253e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ed Amaya","original_name":"Ed Amaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5356728bc3a36841d6002431","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ed Amaya","original_name":"Ed Amaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535672f2c3a36841fe0024f2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1692196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
