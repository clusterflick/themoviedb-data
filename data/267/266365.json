The creators (Adam Cooley/SeaMonster3D) aren't into drugs -- the show is here to ask the question, \"Why do people want to watch a show about a superhero who is on drugs?\" An absurdist existential essay on the idea of animation and superheroes, the core of the show is primarily about a pot-smoking superhero deer who knows he's on \"television\" and constantly talks to the audience about what it's like to be a superhero. He is fully aware he is being animated.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blaze the Pot Smoking Deer","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311412,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Cooley","original_name":"Adam Cooley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535b5af5c3a36830a0000ea9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1763193","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
