Inside, the workers seem to be doing nothing that makes any sense, and they are watched over by a periscope set up by twins who run the factory. An unexplained, plain woman living on the premises is sought after by the whimsical foreman (Maurice Benichou) -- also known as the \"gardener\" because he has planted flowers in the coal wagons that remain on a maze of train tracks -- the only \"stock\" owned by the company.","popularity":0.2693,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le
