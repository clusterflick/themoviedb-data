Sometimes described as frustrating and self-centered, reactions to this film swing across a broad spectrum of complaints -- not the least might be whether or not Gainsbourg is using a clichéd and stereotypical view of \"dark Africa\" to convey what he sees in his characters.","popularity":0.5709,"poster_path":"/s9z9UWmaEA20CnjQISgZ47rRnhV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36812,"logo_path":"/t0cibwMPVH7RD7UsQNqmugDMnw7.png","name":"Gaumont International
