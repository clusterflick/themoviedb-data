The shooting began in 2005 and covered seven years of rehearsals, recordings, talks and concerts, both in Portugal and France. In this film, José Mário Branco talks about music, his convictions, his generation, the dictatorship, the colonial war and his imprisonment and exile. It is the portrait of a man for whom “the song [was always] a weapon.”","popularity":0.0666,"poster_path":"/lVNaWZNw0wZid2jF4wgtRJCKnrx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mudar de vida: José Mário Branco, vida e obra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Mário Branco","original_name":"José Mário Branco","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/n0ffky6Uw1OjnhTdmZ2mpLDtWvC.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"535bb4490e0a264fdb0016f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nélson Guerreiro","original_name":"Nélson Guerreiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535bb4600e0a264fe5001819","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Fidalgo","original_name":"Pedro Fidalgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535bb46a0e0a264fe10017ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1343,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/lVNaWZNw0wZid2jF4wgtRJCKnrx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":896}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
