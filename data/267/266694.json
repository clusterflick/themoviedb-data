She’s led a privileged life in America without hardship or pain. Together these two unlikely friends embark upon a journey from the heights of Mt. Kilimanjaro to the depths of an AIDS ravaged village where even the smallest children become outcasts at the mere hint of the disease and malaria is an ever-present threat. As Venance and Kristen experience the ancient culture, heart-breaking poverty, and eternal spirituality of Venance’s motherland, the ability of the Tanzanian people to love, dream, and persevere in the face of overwhelming hardship triggers a life-changing transformation in Kristen—one that brings her face to face with her own mortality and will ultimately cause thousands of lives to be saved. Tanzania: A Journey Within is a dramatic, emotional, and visually stunning odyssey that will challenge and inspire you.","popularity":0.0623,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tanzania: A Journey Within","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Kenney","original_name":"Kristen Kenney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"535aec44c3a36830b0000654","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venance Ndibalema","original_name":"Venance Ndibalema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"535aec51c3a3683099000637","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":981558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvia Caminer","original_name":"Sylvia Caminer","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535aec17c3a36830a900066d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1411245","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TANZANIA: A JOURNEY WITHIN (aka \"Kwanini\") TRAILER 2013","key":"7wTL5SC8Bj0","published_at":"2013-10-07T14:56:55.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"535e11d1c3a36830a0004d55"}]}}}
