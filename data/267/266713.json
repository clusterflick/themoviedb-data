They are happy, supportive, and free-spirited, yet as time goes by, life on the road becomes more difficult -- it can be boring, and the family is sometimes eyed with distrust by the more conservative provincials and by the police. As the family begins to feel the effects of these aloof attitudes, their solidity is invaded by cracks and chinks until they are well on their way to losing their once-happy union. At that point, one of the children has a bad accident, causing the family members intense anxiety, and as a result, the perspective on their differences starts to change.","popularity":0.0858,"poster_path":"/q3dSiNUQCW35fSVKnM5hogwrPtV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Rock","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Orcier","original_name":"Sylvie Orcier","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/upPwlmSGRfZGvT6UAixSv4H5Hsx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"6359208866540800793deebf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Malavoy","original_name":"Christophe Malavoy","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/4dNe1odZn3SBza3KVLDT0glp5wP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christophe","credit_id":"6359209431644b007f6fb14e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Robert","original_name":"Camille Robert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mirabelle","credit_id":"635920b42cefc20098642a01","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Merle","original_name":"Serge Merle","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pierrot","credit_id":"635920c342f19f007f736daa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Monori","original_name":"Rudolph Monori","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Le Saltimbanque","credit_id":"635920d0ea7b0e007dc08974","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Bourset","original_name":"Jules Bourset","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Julot","credit_id":"635920df665408008196ff42","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Rivera","original_name":"Elsa Rivera","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Une adolescente(as Elsa Bastard)","credit_id":"6359210115959f007f1d1132","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véronique Bisciglia","original_name":"Véronique Bisciglia","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Une adolescente","credit_id":"6359210fea7b0e007dc08996","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Pinheiro","original_name":"José Pinheiro","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/orjk4ZqC7lbzos8AOSNem5Nkwsm.jpg","credit_id":"588b971ec3a368149101baf9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Pinheiro","original_name":"José Pinheiro","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/orjk4ZqC7lbzos8AOSNem5Nkwsm.jpg","credit_id":"588b9725c3a368149101bb03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0083920","wikidata_id":"Q3066245","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/q3dSiNUQCW35fSVKnM5hogwrPtV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1982-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
