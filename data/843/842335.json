Saanjh is the first feature film to have been made and released in the Western Himalayan/ Pahari language. The serenity of village life amidst the Himalayas reaches the peak of sublimity as the visual tour is accompanied by some of the most melodious songs rendered by Mohit Chauhan and Pavithra Chari which strike the heart strings of even those who are unfamiliar with the Pahari dialect. The movie provides a perfect audio-visual setting for a beautiful confluence of the emotional journeys of a daughter, a mother and an orphaned boy as the sun sets on their lives and dusk sets in. Saanjh was the first film in Himachali dialect to be released in cinema halls across India.","popularity":0.5959,"poster_path":"/nvvg2mnpZ0ijguv2yUg1gvi21Jv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enoxx Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Saanjh's father sends her away to live with her grandmother in a remote village, she feels dejected and tries to escape.
