The much debated question of the relationship between humans and large predators is addressed here from an unprecedented point of view: that of the shepherd dog. The camera follows the training of a dog according to the ancient method that will prepare it to care for an entire flock by itself. After training, he will be welcomed by a family whose previous shepherd dog was killed in the pasture by a bear. At the same time, it tells of the journey of the most famous Slovenian wolf, Slavc, who, covering more than a thousand kilometres, reached the Alps, stopping in the Lessinia mountains. A balanced, unforced documentation that calmly recounts the theme of coexistence with the \"children of the bora\", be they dogs or wolves.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/vlfJqcW1LAfWeteQQooTXjSYuaa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sons of Bora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miha Čelar","original_name":"Miha Čelar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cf0edc002134003f8542cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130499,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Blaž Vehovar","original_name":"Blaž Vehovar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cf0f069c24fc0079393edf","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miha Čelar","original_name":"Miha Čelar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b460f4894ed6001ce14d79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldn0GHSDOd7kXeOlNENenjHQgDv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"sl","file_path":"/vlfJqcW1LAfWeteQQooTXjSYuaa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":281722,"name":"volk"},{"id":281723,"name":"kraški ovčar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sl","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
