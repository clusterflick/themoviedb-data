Reportage and department manager Aksel Dahlerup (later radio director from 1959-1967) takes the viewer on a tour through the radio house's many studios, where orchestras rehearse, choir singers rehearse, actors record audio plays and speakers advertise the press radio newspaper. We also drop by the director's office, the music archive and the Marketenderiet, where the house's many employees meet over a bite to eat or a cup of coffee.","popularity":0.0853,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dansk Kulturfilm","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":22910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minerva Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1947-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radiohuset","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3127630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aksel Dahlerup","original_name":"Aksel Dahlerup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Speaker","credit_id":"60cdae619c24fc0058b10cf6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341307,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hagen Hasselbalch","original_name":"Hagen Hasselbalch","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cdae3fe267de003fa9a39c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308790","wikidata_id":"Q33561828","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"1947-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
