The disease can't be taken lightly. Sadly, Alzheimer's and other dementia affect nearly every family in some way.  The most renowned doctors and researchers tell us what they know about the condition so far. The film is also trying to help those who have little or no knowledge of the disease and don't know where to find support. We wanted to show how vulnerable human life can be. Memories, intellect, and personality-all can be lost due to this cruel disease. We don't really understand what happens inside the person or how this disease develops.  What we see is the personality disintegrating, and the person becoming 'someone else'. Positive examples are also shown in the film- well-functioning care settings in France and Hungary and loving families caring for their loved ones.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alzheimer","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3129647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Istv치n Koll치r","original_name":"Istv치n Koll치r","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cdde96967cc7006e27b32e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13376208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
