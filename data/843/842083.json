Some returned to Latvia, many perished, and many were left in exile, where they had their own children.  Nadežda Āriņa and Anatolijs Taurenis were born in the 1950s in permanently frozen Igarka in Siberia. Their mothers had been childhood friends in Latvia before their deportation. Nadja returned to Latvia where she now sells souvenirs, but for Taurenis Latvia is still a dream. In 2007, Nadežda heads to Igarka to visit Taurenis.","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":"/kzr9Yxci6RrWgbBrDWqnSvCpYJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibīrijas bērni","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2008-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Igarka, Hope and Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ēriks Lanss","original_name":"Ēriks Lanss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cbab6e87e63e00285ba2d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Lubānietis","original_name":"Aivars Lubānietis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cbab8a4f3a4c0057ccb0be","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Vasks","original_name":"Pēteris Vasks","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/sydsEChqbQifMFNRgDai2U58a3R.jpg","credit_id":"60cbaba3665408003fd2b177","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60cbab5512197e003f6d3960","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60cbab406654080056bbba33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cbabc9c8a5ac002945f625","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cbabba87e63e006e28997c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q128058222","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kzr9Yxci6RrWgbBrDWqnSvCpYJc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
