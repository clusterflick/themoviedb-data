It's full of precious, occasionally startling images, from an extended 'phantom ride' down busy Calcutta streets to thronging port life, street trading, even the cremation of a human body and the ritual decapitation of lambs on a Bombay street – a scene some viewers may find upsetting.  This is a French production but, like many of the 'exotic' travel films so popular in early cinema, it travelled widely itself – hence this version, with English language intertitles.","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/pyyi5kxnhinrv3b2QLvFAi4J9lx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1906-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indian Scenes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3129512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Hache","original_name":"Maurice Hache","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cdb57b9f51af002909d99d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3129511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Legrand","original_name":"Camille Legrand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cdb5615ed9620029cd0dc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2182,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pyyi5kxnhinrv3b2QLvFAi4J9lx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1455}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
