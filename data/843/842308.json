A mysterious itinerary, reinforced by a troubling resemblance to Jean Gabin. This portrait is built like a cinematographic quest with its montages, its cuts, its lightings and its shadowy zones. The viewer is also taken on a journey through history and landscapes. The journey of this father is traced with subtlety, without emotional overflow, and yet, we are moved.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1ltbeGcTgIiRP6DeQpBHPxAV13t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait imaginaire de Gabriel Bories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudine Bories","original_name":"Claudine Bories","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ccb680b458b800294b1b4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ltbeGcTgIiRP6DeQpBHPxAV13t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
