The castle of Sinterklaas is about to collapse. It must be demolished. That is why Sinterklaas and the Pieten are forced to stay at a campsite. Even Hugo Hogepief is at a loss, because no castle means no presents and gingerbread cookies for the children. Even though Kim Kado, Marco Marsepein and Willem Wortel try their utmost, there is a huge chance that the Sinterklaas party will not happen. But is the castle of Sinterklaas really about to collapse or is it a cunning plan by Stan & Olivier? Kikkie and Paco don't trust everything and start an investigation. Will they manage to save the Sinterklaas party?","popularity":0.5149,"poster_path":"/nuFf9NW6BccuTRC9nopgCyZob0c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141503,"logo_path":"/g9EeWELM1LgA5JTe75X1sQdgR86.png","name":"Messercola","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
