In Homecomings there is an incredible sense of the filmmaker living and breathing his practice. In what is essentially a diary film of a man going back to his homeland, strange things start to happen: photos are animated too quick to catch, actions are sped up through timelapse, and, most profoundly of all, certain shots get transformed into their drawn-on-film equivalents. When we see (from behind) Dirk's son Kees sitting at a table drawing and then the same scene/action but obviously hand-drawn onto the film, it speaks volumes about the filmmaker and his interaction with the world, and is also a sublimely new configuration (in cinema's history) of sight and sound, of signification if you like. Homecomings is a long auto-biographical/diary film that combines the filmmaker's life with the filmmaker's practice.  -Bill Mousoulis","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6XKHUZ8SWyXinPV64XZMM76ltCw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homecomings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Luck","original_name":"Michael Luck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7eb12ed55c3d0035eea526","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dirk de Bruyn","original_name":"Dirk de Bruyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bnvs5MAoCf29KzNdw2RRWSKSXz8.jpg","credit_id":"5f7eb109fdfc9f0038bcc69d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1vVTAAb68BBVF7UL6Zvw9fYjcJ.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mVFZzw3Ra71YMHQxjxFuReQzZQU.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6XKHUZ8SWyXinPV64XZMM76ltCw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":809}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1987-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
