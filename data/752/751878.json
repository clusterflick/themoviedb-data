Interviewed by Gregoretti, the director of Paisà and Europa 51 retraces his life, his work, his relationship with the young critics of the Cahiers du Cinéma who would become the authors of the French New Wave, but also talks about his participation in the May '68 events in Paris. Passing from one theme to another emerges the thought of one of the key figures of the last century and not only in the cinematographic field, a lucid and passionate vision, typical of Rossellini, which combines science, conscience and knowledge and an obstinate faith in the capacities of Man.","popularity":0.1424,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incontri 1969 - Roberto Rossellini: i segreti di un mito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Rossellini","original_name":"Roberto Rossellini","popularity":0.6127,"profile_path":"/dEfCuU0CoIqhgoEDtHZpIoNWNVj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f81a01769eb90003bb98fa0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gastone Favero","original_name":"Gastone Favero","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f81a038d8e15a0038e2dbc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ugo Gregoretti","original_name":"Ugo Gregoretti","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/qGzBO367KSwRZkhIIUUktsc91wF.jpg","credit_id":"5f81a0252667780036b9447d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
