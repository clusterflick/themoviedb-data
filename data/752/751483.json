With the help of the talking magic silver exercise shoes, Archie and Lefty, Dorothy sets off on a mission down the Yellow Brick Road determined to bring fun and fitness back to the Land of Oz. Along the journey, kids at home are invited to dance-and-sing-and-play along while stretching out with the Scarecrow, performing calisthenics with the TinKid, and even trying pushups with the Lion! Some of the important values and lessons that kids also learn from our friends from Oz include: cleaning up your room, personal hygiene, healthy eating habits, making friends and teamwork.","popularity":0.2293,"poster_path":"/1gc6TcgYmDnliOxqASaLpDRr9Nr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giraffe Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventures in Oz with Cheryl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Adventures in Oz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Ann Silich","original_name":"Cheryl Ann Silich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5f7ffa163429ff0036d4127c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Goldstein","original_name":"Eric Goldstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ffaedd8e15a003ae08fe3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808939,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rob Harriss","original_name":"Rob Harriss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ffbb8fdfc9f0035b52897","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
