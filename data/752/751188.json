Locating itself amidst dissonances of language and translation, between what is (not) seen and what is (not) heard, the film is a self-reflexive act of resistance, a quiet morn for the perpetuating dreams of generations of Vietnamese immigrants who lived and left their lives in between the mist of nights.  Made in response and dedicated to 39 Vietnamese immigrants who passed away in the container on their way coming into England in November 2019.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sTijZe6NP02tDzaRWno7O3mGXj8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2020-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To: you, to night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hân Phạm","original_name":"Hân Phạm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f1bbcd8e15a003adddc3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sTijZe6NP02tDzaRWno7O3mGXj8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"English ","note":"DOXA Documentary Festival ","release_date":"2020-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milwaukee Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
