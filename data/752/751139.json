The world's most important collection of pictorial works by psychiatric patients has had a lasting influence on psychiatric and therapeutic practice since its creation in the early 1920s. Modernist art, in particular Paul Klee, Alfred Kubin, Max Ernst and with him the Surrealist movement, also became enthusiastic about the works of \"Insane Art\". But the film does not remain solely in the historical reappraisal, but takes a step into the present. It accompanies two mentally ill patient-artists and formulates the central question of the current definition of art and illness.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/bJcgCEXSi8tJgThuWOvbkDLtCYg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zwischen Wahnsinn und Kunst – Die Sammlung Prinzhorn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328871,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Beetz","original_name":"Christian Beetz","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650d6ef72c6b7b00ac6fa7e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1676230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJcgCEXSi8tJgThuWOvbkDLtCYg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
