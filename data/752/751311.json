Surrealistic representations of nature on the ground floor lead to a synchronized 3-channel installation on the upper floor, in which the world increasingly becomes a representation of inner states. The perception of a woman, who is not visible but whose thoughts are audible, is sharpened in solitude and she herself becomes more and more the subject of her own investigation. The exhibition ends in a protected, binaural listening experience in the attic.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Spacious Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edith Fl端ckiger","original_name":"Edith Fl端ckiger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f643d2f3b170034f38bd7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edith Fl端ckiger","original_name":"Edith Fl端ckiger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f6439d861af00368694a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
