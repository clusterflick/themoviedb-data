Soon, photographs. However, a rare few are able to remember all that no longer exists â€“ but the Memory Police are determined to make sure that what has been erased, remains forgotten forever. When a young novelist realizes her book editor is one of those able to still remember, she hides him in a room beneath her floorboards. As the world closes in around them, they struggle defiantly to hold onto the truth.","popularity":0.4198,"poster_path":"/h6AL5kTF5TQaA28FqfpNoSY9RFx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picture Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Memory Police","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Gladstone","original_name":"Lily Gladstone","popularity":1.0203,"profile_path":"/zYAN84WqZv2sbVE2JDkcWoXGoF7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65b2b6776eecee016234a688","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Scorsese","original_name":"Martin Scorsese","popularity":2.5528,"profile_path":"/9U9Y5GQuWX3EZy39B8nkk4NY01S.jpg","credit_id":"65b52736b6cff1017cf69910","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margot Hand","original_name":"Margot Hand","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b527f6b1131f018d294b04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180170,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yoko Ogawa","original_name":"Yoko Ogawa","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f6eb02f3b170036f3e3bb","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charlie Kaufman","original_name":"Charlie Kaufman","popularity":0.5567,"profile_path":"/75aOpLBpvdtQM3BkWGFUvMs6LvH.jpg","credit_id":"5f7f6e9dd861af003882a3e9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed Morano","original_name":"Reed Morano","popularity":0.1674,"profile_path":"/fXtvqRCPMDhXwvgc3V2oC4GT3AP.jpg","credit_id":"5f7f6e6cd8e15a003be038c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed Morano","original_name":"Reed Morano","popularity":0.1674,"profile_path":"/fXtvqRCPMDhXwvgc3V2oC4GT3AP.jpg","credit_id":"5f7f6e89fdfc9f0035b3aa95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13303578","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h6AL5kTF5TQaA28FqfpNoSY9RFx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1778},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTIVPNeADShXjAI7bxmN54OhyCK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
