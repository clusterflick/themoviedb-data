Filmmaker David Bernabo takes a deep dive on the recently reissued Out of the Blue and the long lost Trust In Rock concert, on the long-gestating audio storyboard The Driver’s Son, and Robert Ashley’s Perfect Lives. Interwoven with discussions on Tyranny’s music is a conversation about the nature of reissues and how distribution is survival for many aging musicians.  Throughout the documentary, Bay Area filmmaker K. O. Beckman’s films with Tyranny, dating back to the 70s, provide rarely-seen performances and video projects.  The film features conversations with Tyranny, composer/musicians Joan La Barbara, Peter Gordon, Kyle Gann, David Grubbs, Philip Perkins, Jeff Berman, and Bill Ruyle, writer Nicole Gagne, artist Pat Oleszko, and Unseen Worlds owner Tommy McCutchon.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/j5uLmRznViRSODinTjebOefRs68.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Trust in rock","title":"Just For The Record: Conversations With And About \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"“Blue” Gene Tyranny","original_name":"“Blue” Gene Tyranny","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fd52ae874507d003f5bd1bc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bernabo","original_name":"David Bernabo","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f80a2a43429ff0038c1f2f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1130,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgafpYpNxMSs64udArBSb0vfN3S.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2008}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j5uLmRznViRSODinTjebOefRs68.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAmULkEGFBPA5pHIZoFYw9mRvc0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
