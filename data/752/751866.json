She breathes music, collects old folksongs and thus connects the people, the present and the past. Rooted in Tarantism and in the tradition of the healers she uses singing as a means to fight alienation. Her portrait is a cinematic legacy vibrating with intensity. It reveals the thin line walked by those who refuse to be satisfied with relative freedom.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/hefW2QgzruSSgCpyqIp1rw8Ru48.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Makarìa","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giulia Attanasio","original_name":"Giulia Attanasio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f819820d8e15a003ae60e62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802498,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stefania Bona","original_name":"Stefania Bona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9bd14d1bf87600385747f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giulia Attanasio","original_name":"Giulia Attanasio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9bd16ad4cc8e0033ec57c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hefW2QgzruSSgCpyqIp1rw8Ru48.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1130}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
