Blue Rose is a documentary essay that takes you through an intercontinental flower auction in the Netherlands, Japan's crazy scientific experiments, a pagan celebration in a Spanish town, and the nostalgic Soviet photo archives of the family garden. The Blue Rose reminds us that the ephemeral nature of flowers is deceiving, and a closer look at them can teach an important lesson about the world in which we live.","popularity":0.1346,"poster_path":"/zAYyRVK9CAJeYsKSSFGgWnirq75.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sinyaya roza","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"파란 장미","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1622802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sasha Kulak","original_name":"Саша Кулак","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/xIVVGPLLTllDU1jVso5qGAlcuna.jpg","credit_id":"638148a7d6590b007b7909b8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2807646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Korsun","original_name":"Olga Korsun","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ebbd9fdfc9f0038bce8b6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2807646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Korsun","original_name":"Olga Korsun","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ebbd5d11e0e0037bf3126","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zAYyRVK9CAJeYsKSSFGgWnirq75.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EXiS 2021(Experimental Film and Video Festival in Seoul)","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
