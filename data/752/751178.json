It’s precisely because the film is anything but alarmist that the alarming aspect of the situation becomes clear. The nuclear nightmare is not over; a safe final nuclear waste repository is not in sight. And yet, boosted by the coal phase-out, many people seem to see “clean” nuclear energy as an option again. The terror of climate change trumps the terror of the nuclear worst case scenario. A zero sum game.","popularity":0.1466,"poster_path":"/5ID9dhI9IO2FyOlG3rechJRI1cC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121410,"logo_path":null,"name":"PIER 53 Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuclear Forever","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrzej Król","original_name":"Andrzej Król","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652e8adccaef2d00c5273841","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carsten Rau","original_name":"Carsten Rau","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f1556fdfc9f0035b31769","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14232314","wikidata_id":"Q104883586","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w4K14bssXGWezA0PZrNRk4CbRjP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ogTIf0nrL2ngq5XIzoa39IGa9mw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k75hrinsfdDxo4bjq9Bp6vg4nJf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e1iRm1nAic9BkBGgQRNk9oVPjGY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2SOWyhtSvIXncChQIF9QUYdXOVU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFlGNbps9MR43vukNWwloutMbGP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.775,"height":267,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/iOtrPFodkRSAEffYJD7vJERK24q.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":741}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ID9dhI9IO2FyOlG3rechJRI1cC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":946},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":807,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xk1guRDgbFZn7b9spoGm6rOAEAT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
