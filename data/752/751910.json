Like James Benningâ€™s Landscape Suicide this film neither fetishizes the murderers nor foregrounds the victims. Instead, Cursed Objects concerns itself with the residual trauma that lingers in the locations where these crimes took place. An off-kilter, far too often forgotten, geography overlaps with the ubiquitous spaces of our lives.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/12LRprLhKZ6t0LL7gSbQmgB5JFv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cursed Objects","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Watkins","original_name":"Daniel Watkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f81bb70075288003938f721","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11486694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":2981,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/12LRprLhKZ6t0LL7gSbQmgB5JFv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1963}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
