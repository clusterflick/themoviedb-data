Paracelsus, doctor and alchemist, scientist and charlatan, seeker after God and narrator of fariy tales, is allowed to come back to earth to prove that he is capable of winning the love of a woman, having wasted his whole life merely writing about her.

head.","popularity":0.1353,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1992-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frau
