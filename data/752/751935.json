By employing a unique blend of absurdist humor and dry, dark comedy, both the insularity and the inertia of progressive society are put on trial and hanged in this bold film that goes places few have ever gone. The film maintains its extended, detailed allegory, in which the physical layout of Manhattan comes to life as its symbols of Progress slowly turn it into a comic liberal dystopia. Anything that \"isn't allowed\" is used to confront the audience with hypocrisy. Make-up plays a crucial role throughout the film, as a hinge that simultaneously showcases characters and the existential reality of the players behind them.","popularity":0.5658,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Decline of the West","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Coffman","original_name":"Chris Coffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eskunder Jones","credit_id":"63527716c99826007abb3a42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3750907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Russell Herbert","original_name":"John Russell Herbert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ianto Griffeth","credit_id":"6352772ef3b49a007a841750","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3750908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Winkler","original_name":"Kathryn Winkler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jayme Paraby","credit_id":"63527746a843c10091b25db7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Coffman","original_name":"Chris Coffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f81c38f1750510036981f09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2157452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":11479,"name":"social commentary"},{"id":11593,"name":"racist remark"},{"id":11921,"name":"sociology"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":184816,"name":"blackface"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
