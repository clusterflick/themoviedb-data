His Bike Life Circus has helped create a brand-new urban sport, its unofficial races taking place on go kart tracks, cycle parks and around industrial estates. Central to this has been the rapid growth of the ‘knives down, bikes’ up’ movement, with young riders in London amassing to take a stand against knife crime. Director Martin Read captures the energy of these events, putting audiences at the heart of the action and delivering a visceral thrill-ride of a film.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bike Life Extreme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3610641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Read","original_name":"Martin Read","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c1e92bf1b571004cf7490e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
