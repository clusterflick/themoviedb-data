None of the USSR's efforts could cope with them; planned land reclamation or freeway construction came to nothing. The marshes are gracious; you can pick cranberries there and earn good money, but they also inspire respect and are dangerous. And unchanged for centuries. The archaic world they remember is still alive in the people there. It is preserved in songs, in stories, in the way of thinking. In the film, together with a charismatic guide, Saganicha, we go deep into the swamps, listening to colorful stories about sacred and cursed places. We observe paradoxical, funny and touching situations in the lives of the characters. We touch the rules of life taken out of the past, improbable for us today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olmany","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
