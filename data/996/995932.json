Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, comes a \"mystical\" love story that movie critics nationwide consider A MUST SEE.  How far would you go for love when the one you cherish hurts you beyond repair? Would you hurt back? Or would you love back? Would you change things? Josh (Mick Shane) is about to find out. He must sacrifice it all, even his own life, for the only woman he has ever loved, Violet (Sylvie Hoffer - Charlie's Angels, Any Given Sunday).  With an \"otherworldly\" twist that will move you beyond words, THE PARABLE OF THE CHRIST proves to be the greatest love story ever told!","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":178268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvest Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you die for love?","title":"The Parable of the Christ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Shane","original_name":"Mick Shane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3adcb773941005aca3cfc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Hoffer","original_name":"Sylvie Hoffer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3add76a300b004c558a70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Dylan","original_name":"Todd Dylan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3ade3af6e942c95272fc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Russo","original_name":"Michelle Russo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3adf5c525c4007bcf227a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Ellis","original_name":"Mike Ellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3adff6a300b007c28e788","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrician Dean","original_name":"Patrician Dean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3ae11773941007d2a348d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Horton","original_name":"Mike Horton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3ae203af929007ca5f965","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612183,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnold Jiha","original_name":"Arnold Jiha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3ad0b773941004dac9a51","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Salazar","original_name":"Juan Salazar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3ad6bf6fd18007cebbad8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George David Jiha","original_name":"George David Jiha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3acc8a313b8004c49b93b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joshua Mashiach","original_name":"Joshua Mashiach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3ad954e4dff005a9b5500","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Chame De Jiha","original_name":"Anita Chame De Jiha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3ad48f6fd180059985b7c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George David Jiha","original_name":"George David Jiha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bea524fa4046007d4eacf5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George David Jiha","original_name":"George David Jiha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bea5285be00e00937e72ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
