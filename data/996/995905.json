For all of his adult life he has worked as a curandero and vegetalista, a traditional healer. He estimates that in his career he has treated more than 2,500 clients. Through the camera lens of anthropologist Luis Eduardo Luna, Don Emilio tells us about his practice, his beliefs, his community, and his life. He shows us how he prepares ayahuasca and other herbal medicines. Finally, we see Don Emilio treat a man who has come to him for help, and hear from a poor woman who has brought her infant son for medical care.","popularity":0.2775,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Emilio and His Little Doctors","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3612057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Andrade Gómez","original_name":"Emilio Andrade Gómez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62c390c42da84600817c3549","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Luna","original_name":"Luis Luna","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c392e43af929007ca5ec96","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Luna","original_name":"Luis Luna","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c392b09672ed23d09555ac","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Luna","original_name":"Luis Luna","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c39039a313b8004c49aade","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2650335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Luna","original_name":"Luis Luna","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c392cc2a210c06ccc6a378","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence McKenna","original_name":"Terence McKenna","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/9oSXQwNy9EjCQ6ONhohfNzKHlje.jpg","credit_id":"62c39727544c41007c79abfd","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612104,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ilkka Kukkonen","original_name":"Ilkka Kukkonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3999e22e4802ab37cd95e","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Prelorán","original_name":"Jorge Prelorán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c39929773941004dac913e","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612103,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Åke Hultkrantz","original_name":"Åke Hultkrantz","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3996bf6fd180059985169","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612105,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mauri Lounasmaa","original_name":"Mauri Lounasmaa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c399ddaf6e942c95272587","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3157314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ismo Vehkakoski","original_name":"Ismo Vehkakoski","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c39c064a4bfc007b2823b4","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3579189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heimo Lappalainen","original_name":"Heimo Lappalainen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c39a2722e4802ab4ee275e","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612106,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Helen Wiita","original_name":"Helen Wiita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c39a7e544c41004cb7e72a","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612123,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Henry A.
