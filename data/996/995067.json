I couldn’t drive at that point, so I just took along the Bolex. We left from Philadelphia; we stayed up all night the night before, and then got in the car & drove. The first night we stopped in Nashville, the second night in Albuquerque, and the last night, we got to Los Angeles. Rod delivered the car, & I took off for San Francisco, because LA seemed dull and dangerous.  When I got to San Francisco, I looked up a guy named Terry Barlow, whom I hadn’t seen in years and years, and just walked in on him unannounced. The trip was shot in black and white, and the other stuff in color negative. I shot Terry Barlow in Golden Gate Park, doing an improvised dance next to a carousel.”- WWD","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devotion for Travelers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3609603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roderick Townley","original_name":"Roderick Townley","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62c0e8bef1b5710059a90ac6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wheeler Dixon","original_name":"Wheeler Dixon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/emxPVlTEPcAhB1OkWUprd6AIPaj.jpg","credit_id":"62c0e8cb1056110ecf3147ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
