Dad makes excuses for the Tooth Fairy. Late that night, after fixing the sink, he remembers his dental duties. Under his sleeping daughter's pillow, he finds a note and the first clue to a treasure hunt she has set out for the Tooth Fairy. He's exhausted, but he searches out clue after clue as the night passes. It's a race against the sun.","popularity":0.5362,"poster_path":"/u9uua9FNkqI1zFvdr2Vubl6P9Ob.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4545,"logo_path":"/k9dErisrlWRJLvIkJYgKrIZVSnO.png","name":"RSA
