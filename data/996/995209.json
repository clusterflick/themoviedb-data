How can we nevertheless understand our role in the climate system and manage the crisis? Climate change is a complex global problem. Increasingly extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and more difficult living conditions - including for us humans - are already the order of the day. Global society has never faced such a complex challenge. For young people in particular, the frightening climate scenarios will be a reality in the future. For the global south, it is already today. To overcome this crisis, different perspectives are needed. \"THE UNPREDICTABLE FACTOR\" goes back to the origins of the German environmental movement, accompanies today's activists in the Rhineland in their fight against the coal industry and gives a voice to scientists from climate research, ethnology and psychology.","popularity":1.0097,"poster_path":"/wQk0ZlO2oHG4E6BpwmzQBPjj7xR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185238,"logo_path":null,"name":"BE WILD
