In 1974, the building was demolished.  One morning, just before the demolition crew moved in, I set up my Bolex and shot 100' of the mural before it was completely destroyed, and here it is. The film is silent; the light is all natural; the film is Ektachrome Reversal 7241, a really beautiful daylight film stock - 2.5 minutes of contemplation.\" - WWD","popularity":0.0638,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wheeler Dixon","original_name":"Wheeler Dixon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/emxPVlTEPcAhB1OkWUprd6AIPaj.jpg","credit_id":"62c0edcc63d713026c2f3066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0071540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
