Enter the stooges as janitors sent to clean the man's office. After some of their antics, the boy's suitability for the job is apparent and they're hired. The stooges go to the convention, but double cross their boss and vote for another candidate, Abel Lamb Stewer. When the boss and his muscle man come looking for revenge, the boys defeat them in a wild fight.","popularity":0.6747,"poster_path":"/3hzZm67GDDFeEMqniAO6oQOcyoj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A crooked campaign manager recruits the Stooges as delegates \"Who are too dumb to think and wholl do what we tell them.\"","title":"Three Dark Horses","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shemp Howard","original_name":"Shemp Howard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/b6L3kV2qnputHSsd7uYirjKEMBC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shemp","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Welden","original_name":"Ben Welden","popularity":0.4643,"profile_path":"/cVN2BBCClcvSk7N9DsP8Z0wtNya.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jim Digger","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth MacDonald","original_name":"Kenneth MacDonald","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/hnCiqF8FIr8hm090HI56cwqLLcI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"William 'Bill' Wick","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6ef","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felix Adler","original_name":"Felix Adler","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b93c3a36847f820a6e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","credit_id":"655ca17853866e011c0acf4b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34174,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry Freulich","original_name":"Henry Freulich","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655ca1a7b5400214d3ccc543","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13864,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Cary Odell","original_name":"Cary Odell","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655ca1b93d745400c63804d5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1999631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Nicholson","original_name":"James Nicholson","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655ca207f6787a011d5f0a1c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18578,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edwin H.
