The short films of the directors of Amer are technically rawer than that film, but they show what was to come in terms of themes based on giallo films and an abstract style, from the use of still frames like in Chris Marker's La Jetée to harsh coloured lighting. They are worth seeing by themselves as a refining of their ideas into a fantastic debut feature film.","popularity":0.2043,"poster_path":"/rgDSpfgdECUhUKRhSXyfoBduD0l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2002-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yellow
