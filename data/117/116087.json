When they learn they'll have to catch 100,000 flies to earn enough to get a patent, some crooks overhear and think the boys are the $100,000 sweepstakes winners. When the crooks give chase, the stooges hide in a sporting goods store where Curly shoots a dummy, which they mistake for a real person. The boys decide to bury the \"body\" in a pet cemetery, but the cemetery owner arrives from a costume party with his partners, all dressed as spooks, and they proceed to scare the devil out of the stooges.","popularity":0.351,"poster_path":"/wXQBvDg2G0CLO5fymLYm6aaRhcG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1945-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Pests in a Mess","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curly Howard","original_name":"Curly Howard","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/ozWdyoTNqWy55bOglIFqR4ZalwZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Curly","credit_id":"52fe4b83c3a36847f82077dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"53c92523c3a3686e76001062","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"53c9252ec3a3686e7f001197","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine McIntyre","original_name":"Christine McIntyre","popularity":0.2517,"profile_path":"/cYn5QyYfaK7HwTkUYsVH4qu5fxJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cheatham's Secretary","credit_id":"52fe4b83c3a36847f82077e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":568914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian O'Hara","original_name":"Brian O'Hara","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"I.
