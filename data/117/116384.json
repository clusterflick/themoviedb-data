Centuries after Ner De Nude's death, Angus Farnsworth, a timid Hollywood advertising man finds the magic spectacles. Overwhelmed by his newfound power, he leaves his wife and drives away in his 1927 Flint automobile to become involved in a series of rare adventures in which he is able to view women in their undergarments. His fling comes to an end when his wife and the police catch up with him, and he discards the spectacles.","popularity":0.2624,"poster_path":"/uiFgaNrIRmcdPNh2aFyyLngYjB8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fairway International Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Boy, Oh Boy!
