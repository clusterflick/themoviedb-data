They quickly get on the bad side of the producer. First they fail to prevent a famous critic from sneaking into the audience. Then Shemp accidentally adds a pot holder into a cake they bake as a prop. During the play the stooges (as southern gentlemen) and the rest of the cast spit up feathers during what was supposed to be a serious scene. The critic thinks it's a hilarious satire and the boys are redeemed.","popularity":0.6383,"poster_path":"/1YXgbcSvHa03N0QVA6GODvCjfUc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE STOOGES' SLAP-HAPPIEST LINE-UP OF GAGS AND GALS!","title":"Three Hams on Rye","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shemp Howard","original_name":"Shemp Howard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/b6L3kV2qnputHSsd7uYirjKEMBC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shemp","credit_id":"52fe4b8ec3a36847f82097b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"58a87ec8c3a36845a90004e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"58a87ebec3a36845cb0004a8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":971436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanette Bordeaux","original_name":"Nanette Bordeaux","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/brpgSzjVmp6lRDYN6fpQ0vqdyUs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lulabelle","credit_id":"52fe4b8ec3a36847f82097b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine McIntyre","original_name":"Christine McIntyre","popularity":0.2517,"profile_path":"/cYn5QyYfaK7HwTkUYsVH4qu5fxJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Janiebelle","credit_id":"52fe4b8ec3a36847f82097b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Sitka","original_name":"Emil Sitka","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/hsSU6n8qZTOYNvj2t27ArQIfF1r.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"B.K.
