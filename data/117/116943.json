One day her solitude is intruded upon by the arrival of a documentary filmmaker. In his eyes Inta is an outstanding would-be film protagonist but the wild woman would rather put a curse on the importunate intruder than let herself be filmed. But the filmmaker's persistence finally succeeds in melting the ice of Inta's heart... just in order to break it soon afterwards.","popularity":0.2022,"poster_path":"/8e91HAhQyKBwBajjvnvX6ig0ZCH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio AVE","origin_country":""},{"id":112965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anša Epnera studija AVE","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary filmmaker and his dream protagonist.
