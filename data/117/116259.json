When they gyp the head of the palace guard, they're brought to the palace to be executed, but instead become royal chamberlains after curing the King's toothache. When they recover some tax money stolen by a corrupt official, the King rewards them with marriage to his daughter. After getting a look at the ugly crone, Moe and Larry select Shemp to be the groom.","popularity":0.4746,"poster_path":"/fiRuzN9p7fEQgyzzyvT3j9xpBtk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In ancient Egypt, the Stooges are Honest Moe, Honest Shemp and Just Plain Larry used chariot dealers who use their half-wits to get in favor with the King.","title":"Mummy's Dummies","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mummy's Dummies","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shemp Howard","original_name":"Shemp Howard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/b6L3kV2qnputHSsd7uYirjKEMBC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shemp","credit_id":"52fe4b88c3a36847f82086d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"5422c7ee0e0a263b7e001599","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"5422c7f60e0a263b8100162c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Dent","original_name":"Vernon Dent","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/hIZai6jeEnoomMjlJm2bhHSQ15O.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"King Rootentooten","credit_id":"52fe4b88c3a36847f82086ef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Dunn","original_name":"Ralph Dunn","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/xbTC3C9E793jgUde7vqDe8xrg55.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rhadames","credit_id":"52fe4b88c3a36847f82086dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Van Zandt","original_name":"Philip Van Zandt","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":"/q1PwWNkP577op6MHYXshZWWbTtz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Futamon (Tax Collector)","credit_id":"52fe4b88c3a36847f82086e1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1468551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Perry","original_name":"Wanda Perry","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/huYQpmXFdwz7ZFjn11ZoOOAuGs8.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Princess Fatima (uncredited)","credit_id":"630fa6d660620a0083e5d927","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1413586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Ridgway","original_name":"Suzanne Ridgway","popularity":0.1769,"profile_path":"/fCzOpu1U7YmVWKjSXlPXUYY92k4.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Pretty Girl (uncredited)","credit_id":"642c17ba8de0ae00f4c1c07d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3993792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Spangler","original_name":"Jean Spangler","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/mOrswJigknPvyVi0c4UCfCS4JDl.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Pretty Girl (uncredited)","credit_id":"642c17c89cc67b05796cbf97","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Bernds","original_name":"Edward Bernds","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/5HREQElhmdsUwok6k9i8vZ7xfK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b88c3a36847f82086eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh McCollum","original_name":"Hugh McCollum","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539165041aac400aa089b23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elwood Ullman","original_name":"Elwood Ullman","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653916610fb17f0138fcd00c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34438,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allen G.
