With a clear and compassionate eye, filmmaker Atsushi Funahashi follows the displaced people as they struggle to adapt to their new environment. Among the vivid personalities who emerge are the town mayor, a Moses without a Promised Land; and a farmer who would rather defy the government than abandon his cows to certain starvation.","popularity":0.3249,"poster_path":"/dDfe50pINMaqv9h1CojT8S4LIBJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuclear Nation","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Futaba kara tooku hanarete","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Nuclear Nation : The Fukushima Refugees Story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Atsushi Funahashi","original_name":"舩橋淳","popularity":0.2298,"profile_path":"/6Xr0UCa4e5hy3BJp8j1UnfiGOo6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ba6c3a36847f820db35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryuichi Sakamoto","original_name":"坂本龍一","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/nYMG17bYaFkyTzs37W80G0MofPd.jpg","credit_id":"63aeff5f8741c400e0392260","department":"Sound","job":"Theme Song Performance"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3608822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoshiko Hashimoto","original_name":"Yoshiko Hashimoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63af00068741c4007c7048c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":960132,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Haruyuki Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木治行","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63af00215ad76b0094c75d49","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25646,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yutaka Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎裕","popularity":0.2067,"profile_path":"/gW8dR1Tb06MVqqG9e8Cayym4OBy.jpg","credit_id":"63af004c8741c400bfdf79f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2215363","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1253,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dDfe50pINMaqv9h1CojT8S4LIBJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":876}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155652,"name":"nuclear"},{"id":215355,"name":"fukushima disaster (2011)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
