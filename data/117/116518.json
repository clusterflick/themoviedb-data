Yet, Ryan Villopoto is the most private, reserved and soft-spoken individual in the sport. Hailing from the school of walking softly and carrying a big stick, the supremely talented and fiercely determined athlete lets his riding - and winning ways - do the talking. To that end, Volcom set out to peel back the layers and dig out the soul and charisma of the champion. We traveled the nation over, meeting family, friends, industry members and a hero to discover the real RV. What we found, well, we'll let the film and Ryan do the talking.","popularity":0.1335,"poster_path":"/1pyEOdmLHSvCZckLIJXKz0WKXje.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ryan Villopoto, 2 Be Continued","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Villopoto","original_name":"Ryan Villopoto","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a243","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy McGrath","original_name":"Jeremy McGrath","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a21f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Villopoto","original_name":"Dan Villopoto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a223","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Villopoto","original_name":"Kristen Villopoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a227","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldon Baker","original_name":"Aldon Baker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a22b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Williamson","original_name":"Mike Williamson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a22f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitch Payton","original_name":"Mitch Payton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a233","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikey Fisher","original_name":"Mikey Fisher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a237","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Cianciarulo","original_name":"Adam Cianciarulo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a23b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Mitcheff","original_name":"Jon Mitcheff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a23f","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063986,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Troy Eckert","original_name":"Troy Eckert","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a215","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063987,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Troy Powell","original_name":"Troy Powell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b91c3a36847f820a21b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1pyEOdmLHSvCZckLIJXKz0WKXje.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
