Until now, he has never given filmakers access into his life on the road. Filmed during portions of Mark Kozelek s European and North American tours of 2010 and 2011, this is a rare glimpse into Mark s backstage areas and passenger seat travels. Shot in black and white, this dynamic film captures the fast paced travel of a singer on a solo-acoustic journey, giving viewers an inspirational look at its high points, and also a stark view of its mundane realities. Footage includes an intimate version of 'Katy Song' performed at Sant'Ambrogio Church in Bologna, a mesmerizing 'Half Moon Bay' performed in Switzerland, and a flamenco-flourished Third and Seneca' filmed in a Copenhagen hotel room. . The film s soundtrack includes album tracks, concert recordings, hotel room performances, and a score written and performed by Mark Kozelek","popularity":0.1777,"poster_path":"/pV7Wt6jBK6DC8JitwmsCQGdqMA2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Kozelek On Tour: A Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kozelek","original_name":"Mark Kozelek","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/goaD10XAkosdcKNniQgXXdC0LtC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c7c8d1d92514175a246caa9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kozelek","original_name":"Mark Kozelek","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/goaD10XAkosdcKNniQgXXdC0LtC.jpg","credit_id":"670acde23bb4557c669b380f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kozelek","original_name":"Mark Kozelek","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/goaD10XAkosdcKNniQgXXdC0LtC.jpg","credit_id":"670acdf2bbb1a9e81c61ac20","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2513858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qf1gWYY1fyfIT7u2xUvIbmCQCbE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pV7Wt6jBK6DC8JitwmsCQGdqMA2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mark Kozelek - On Tour.
