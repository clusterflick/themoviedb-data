When all of the gang except Richard and Philippe are pinched, things look grim. Plus, Richard insists that they take in a wide-eyed immigrant lad, a deaf-mute left behind in the arrests. Philippe suggests a three-person pickpocket trick, using the boy, but when that goes spectacularly badly, they hit rock bottom. Then, at the cinema, the lad finds a solution. It's time to celebrate.","popularity":0.1111,"poster_path":"/c1J3GExIvB8rQWmgyxuMhRXJqrV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mozart of Pickpockets","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Mozart dos Batedores de Carteira","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matteo Razzouki-Safardi","original_name":"Matteo Razzouki-Safardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"L'enfant","credit_id":"615eb0bdeb14fa0043e4e93c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Pollet-Villard","original_name":"Philippe Pollet-Villard","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/qe86OnZbnGP8RGgloNV9qIhoEnk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Philippe","credit_id":"59b005d2c3a3682c48066f76","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Morgiève","original_name":"Richard Morgiève","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"59b005be925141072f06f511","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Pollet-Villard","original_name":"Philippe Pollet-Villard","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/qe86OnZbnGP8RGgloNV9qIhoEnk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b95c3a36847f820acdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Pollet-Villard","original_name":"Philippe Pollet-Villard","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/qe86OnZbnGP8RGgloNV9qIhoEnk.jpg","credit_id":"550b523d925141469c00209e","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51509,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philippe Piffeteau","original_name":"Philippe Piffeteau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d94a8dbefd9101641efbe6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491753,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cyril Nakache","original_name":"Cyril Nakache","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d94abd4e4dff0163b740b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150429,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Flemming Nordkrog","original_name":"Flemming Nordkrog","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/w1ur9QAo6MHX1C3WEzMzciSYvqM.jpg","credit_id":"65d94aac4e4dff017cb75937","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0820971","wikidata_id":"Q3224843","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/c1J3GExIvB8rQWmgyxuMhRXJqrV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":731}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
