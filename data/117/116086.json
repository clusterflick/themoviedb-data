On their lunch break they go into a restaurant with their Japanese uniforms on, causing the proprietor to mistake them for the real thing, and a chase ensues. The boys fall through a trap door, and into a nest of Nazi spies where they are mistaken for \"Naki\", \"Saki\" and \"Waki\", three Japanese saboteurs. The Stooges try to act the part, including demonstrating acrobatics and jiu-jitsu to their hosts. When the real \"Naki\", \"Saki\" and \"Waki\" show up, the boys are exposed as impostors, but after a wild fight manage to capture all the Axis spies.","popularity":0.502,"poster_path":"/zxlQofWboK1qRZ910Hhl6XsqM7o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia
