Hybrid composition, it alternates originals and reconstructions performed by actors (docudrama). A not-so-subtle condemnation of Hitler, Nazism and Germany by the movie's French film makers, which conveniently makes no mention of how the policies of Great Britain and France created Hitler and allowed him to go as far as he did prior to the beginning of the Second World War.","popularity":0.3769,"poster_path":"/pqLZUX62QBWbBKLi2nvtsbgansV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cristaldifilm
