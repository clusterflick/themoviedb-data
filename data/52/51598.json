With unprecedented openness, remaining band members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl discuss the production of individual songs, and tell amusing anecdotes about the band's financial struggles just before making it big. In addition, NEVERMIND producer Butch Vig invites viewers into his studio, where he dissects and examines each of the album's tracks. By isolating, examining, and reassembling each instrument and vocal track, Vig is able to recreate the manner in which the album was produced.","popularity":1.858,"poster_path":"/fq86ZF0Tgrrwq93bjy7EufNfjdg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isis Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":98253,"logo_path":null,"name":"1515 Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...the definitive authorised story of the album.","title":"Classic Albums: Nirvana - Nevermind","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":37,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":533061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Grohl","original_name":"Dave Grohl","popularity":1.0756,"profile_path":"/hDfFm3lLPcdupe3PDucZdidKFBI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe47fac3a36847f8152897","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krist Novoselic","original_name":"Krist Novoselic","popularity":0.2097,"profile_path":"/x4EJYpTO86jRGm2zvWsSaqsmJZ5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe47fac3a36847f815289b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87054,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Butch Vig","original_name":"Butch Vig","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/Ard5kBxw7mHkLBShUIw4J26d79D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe47fac3a36847f815289f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Smeaton","original_name":"Bob Smeaton","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/Aafmc2EGuPdrP6jL2FFOqhAGRCA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47fac3a36847f81528a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick De Grunwald","original_name":"Nick De Grunwald","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552128a89251415c87003602","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bous De Jong","original_name":"Bous De Jong","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552128d29251415c84003531","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":995506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin R.
