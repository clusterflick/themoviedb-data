Though the three have made a living performing at comedy clubs, they are perhaps best known for their home-made short films. The STELLA SHORTS have garnered cult success because of their nonsensical plotlines, absurd dialogue, graphic sexual humor, sporatic violence, and sheer hilarity. This DVD showcases the trio's first twenty-three adventures, each one more bizarre and hysterical than the last. Highlights include: a game of whiffleball that goes terribly awry, an expedition to the South Pole (?) to meet Santa Claus, an edge-of-your-seat moustache-growing contest, a twisted \"whodunit\"-style murder mystery, and much, much more.","popularity":3.2957,"poster_path":"/oZvA35zuHv6hYOmCzdrLLGBN9TM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stella Shorts 1998-2002","video":true,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ian Black","original_name":"Michael Ian Black","popularity":0.3312,"profile_path":"/qAOJfAK6VjV7ugRfy1zbud14OkQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"5f5241a1e894a600374cc2cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Showalter","original_name":"Michael Showalter","popularity":0.5084,"profile_path":"/AtX8Eli8Cg8g8HrcRJDBFnplyN0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"5f5241aa848eb900345b67d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wain","original_name":"David Wain","popularity":0.581,"profile_path":"/yh4AtjuNvBwca8HvzIXjo1Y1Nwf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"David","credit_id":"5f5241b4c740d900348ec244","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1492804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Hellman","original_name":"Nina Hellman","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/8bCxPQ3EBnwteKVEYKEXeFbSIHO.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"David's Cousin's Wife / Poker Wife / Brooklyn Girl","credit_id":"665e60db86d7743068604dd4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Hamilton","original_name":"Josh Hamilton","popularity":0.7564,"profile_path":"/7nuAUPd7E8iOE5lhUcNpogS2akP.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"David's Cousin Greg","credit_id":"665e60ff40fd34ce9620c347","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosadel Varela","original_name":"Rosadel Varela","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Taco Woman","credit_id":"665e6123887b94bf5b655b38","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Galifianakis","original_name":"Zach Galifianakis","popularity":3.9818,"profile_path":"/qsDfoUlRnXHUiqZeBPWHzmgmKGX.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Santa","credit_id":"665e62998ddc320de29d565d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francie Swift","original_name":"Francie Swift","popularity":0.716,"profile_path":"/iEP2BCMely2ulBhxWeIYV1xIgqz.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Santa's Wife","credit_id":"665e62c00b4978c8586052bb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Salett","original_name":"Peter Salett","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/os6BLvBR6bU6WsuKmAmJ8YNPMLw.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Sherpa / Indian / Terrorist / Policeman / Park Dancer","credit_id":"665e62f3d10af8ba792f36bc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Cooper","original_name":"Bradley Cooper","popularity":3.9226,"profile_path":"/DPnessSsWqVXRbKm93PtMjB4Us.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Yoga Student / Satan","credit_id":"6787bdadd969fd27cbbafeeb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Rudd","original_name":"Paul Rudd","popularity":5.135,"profile_path":"/6jtwNOLKy0LdsRAKwZqgYMAfd5n.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"John","credit_id":"6787bdc62a1a2c95c77af8a0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zak Orth","original_name":"Zak Orth","popularity":0.2802,"profile_path":"/ldywlWMt89PO3qLDL174TpTc0ce.jpg","cast_id":29,"character":"Turkey Hunter / Christmas Caroler / Inspector / Enos / Friend","credit_id":"6787eadcbd793c03544f33ea","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.D.
