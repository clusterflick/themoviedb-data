Tigers, and other big cats, are simultaneously an occupation and an obsession for Hill. As the film begins, Hill has 24 tigers, 3 bears, 6 leopards and one cougar. He claims to know exactly what they are thinking by the look in their eyes. He is especially consumed with the prospect of breeding a stripeless white tiger. But now, after a surprise government inspection, he’s lost the license that allowed him to keep exotic animals, and the state of Indiana is threatening to shut him down. He has just five days to find alternate homes for all but three of his brood and to bring his facilities up to code – or else lose what he considers to be his life’s work.","popularity":0.124,"poster_path":"/lyaet664cVp3nJ2RMWPHgTphGkW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tiger Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilla Calamandrei","original_name":"Camilla Calamandrei","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55fc2fd9c3a36826e50027de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1414111","wikidata_id":"Q7769252","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lyaet664cVp3nJ2RMWPHgTphGkW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":588}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Tiger Next Door\" (tiger documentary) - a film about private ownership of wild animals","key":"lvObOpqPZho","published_at":"2009-04-03T18:40:55.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6adc3a3685448005a58"}]}}}
