Late at night, everyone decides to go into the pool, except Stamm, who is drunk. Montague dives in as does Greeff and Leland, but only Greeff and Leland come out. Montague is no where to be found so Leland suspects foul play and calls the cops. Luckily, Philo is with the D.A. and comes along, but they do not find Montague. When they drain the pool the next day, they find nothing except what looks like dragon prints. Philo has his suspicions and tries to piece the clues together to find out what has happened.","popularity":1.0426,"poster_path":"/cTuPo6R2d3KBtfHa1CLd0QWsgpG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"FOLLOW FAMOUS PHILO VANCE AS HE SOLVES THE AMAZING SWIMMING POOL MURDER MYSTERY!","title":"The Dragon Murder Case","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren William","original_name":"Warren William","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/w2M7yW9iUSTric3qppRadXzbf7W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Philo Vance","credit_id":"52fe47f8c3a36847f81522d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Lindsay","original_name":"Margaret Lindsay","popularity":0.3706,"profile_path":"/70geXvjmQKZIqQdbaZ0eKKTWCym.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bernice Stamm","credit_id":"52fe47f8c3a36847f81522d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyle Talbot","original_name":"Lyle Talbot","popularity":0.3967,"profile_path":"/a4rVESEvJg6VRd23M6FLRjlfsta.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gale Leland","credit_id":"52fe47f8c3a36847f81522d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Pallette","original_name":"Eugene Pallette","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/y3n1c9qjmJzGeZWihwm0QWlmDoR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sgt.
