It deals with every historical and contemporary aspect of hemp usage and cultivation (mainly in the U.S.), which turns out to be a lot. From describing the production of a fiber much more durable and economic than wood, the documentary discusses hemps multilateral uses as e.g. food products, as a non-polluting fuel and as a pharmaceutical product with much less grievous side-effects than chemical pharmaceutical products. The film also investigates why America went from a country which produced vast quantities of the non-narcotic industrial hemp, to the complete ban on hemp production in 1938. This story in particular is interesting, and it points out that the large oil-based industries actually had a key role in the aforementioned ban. Food for thought! The conclusion of the documentary could be that hemp may prove to be a valid alternative to both oil and wood in the future.","popularity":0.1105,"poster_path":"/4SI0pZ9RSHB4u3VxZmS2g1WZx52.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hemp Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Dale Scott","original_name":"Peter Dale Scott","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iFihPdwibgQ2AmfomLHQH0UD4sn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6427687101b1ca00d5e77986","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Clarke","original_name":"Anthony Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64276ba99cc67b05bf6eaec7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Clarke","original_name":"Anthony Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64276bcae2ff320095094a35","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Clarke","original_name":"Anthony Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64276b919cc67b0571570996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1530,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4SI0pZ9RSHB4u3VxZmS2g1WZx52.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1020}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
