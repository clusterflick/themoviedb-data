The Blu-ray transfer reveals a pleasing color-scheme, good contrast and lack of overly disturbing \"motion-judder\". The actual show is filmed by multiple, strategically placed, HD cameras that do an excellent job of Adam Gontier and the rest of the guys in Three Days Grace. Furthermore, you would see plenty of the audience as well; the HD cameras zoom over and around the stage providing a good look at the entire venue. In addition to the concert footage, Three Days Grace: Live At The Palace also provides plenty of behind the scene footage where fans of the band are seen interacting with their idols.","popularity":0.1688,"poster_path":"/krNjTXuFiNoSivq2BX7LdcETpyp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Three Days Grace","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Days Grace - Live at the Palace","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Three Days Grace - Live At The Place","type":"DVD"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Gontier","original_name":"Adam Gontier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Vocals / Rhythm Guitar","credit_id":"52fe47eec3a36847f814fe8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Walst","original_name":"Brad Walst","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bass Guitar / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"52fe47eec3a36847f814fe93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Sanderson","original_name":"Neil Sanderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Drums / Percussion / Piano / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"52fe47eec3a36847f814fe97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Stock","original_name":"Barry Stock","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lead Guitar","credit_id":"52fe47eec3a36847f814fe9b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":86298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Drumm","original_name":"Michael Drumm","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47eec3a36847f814fea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":86298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Drumm","original_name":"Michael Drumm","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47eec3a36847f814fea1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1948644","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2PqdDjHo7O0Xa2O05HqGjypAMk8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krNjTXuFiNoSivq2BX7LdcETpyp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
