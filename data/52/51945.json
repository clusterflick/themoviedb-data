Gilberte, in middle-age, flirts with men but loves her husband Georges, wishing he were more demonstrative. He's negotiating a deal with an American, Eric Thomson, who turns out to be Gilberte's first husband from an annulled and secret stateside marriage. Along with her sister Arlette, Gilberte begs Eric not to tell Georges about the marriage. Meanwhile, a young artist, Charly, pursues Gilberte while Arlette tries to match him with the young Huguette, who loves him. Will Eric play along or try to re-win Gilberte's affection? Can Gilberte play one off against another? And who will manage to kiss whom on the lips?","popularity":0.7642,"poster_path":"/vpfbKUkvOrv0atZMlHAzNqAAhEL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2
