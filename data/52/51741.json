Covering a period of 18 months, the film follows the activities of a group of young men in their 20s who have finished their schooling and stayed in their home village - they loaf about unemployed since they canÂ´t find any work in the remote district. The main characters are more or less idle young fellows whose stories link together and make up the film. Tinged with humour, The Idle Ones is a story about frustrated but vital young people in a period of transition, waiting for something to happen. For some, the waiting is becoming their life.","popularity":0.5705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":18405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinotar","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2001-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Idle Ones","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Joutilaat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanna Helke","original_name":"Susanna Helke","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5798eca1c3a3682bec001555","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanna Helke","original_name":"Susanna Helke","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5798ec7792514101e1002225","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virpi Suutari","original_name":"Virpi Suutari","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5798ec95c3a3682bfd001337","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virpi Suutari","original_name":"Virpi Suutari","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5798ec89c3a3682bfd001335","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lasse Saarinen","original_name":"Lasse Saarinen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670146f99ebea19006f8615b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0301485","wikidata_id":"Q5398806","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10216,"name":"outcast"},{"id":156052,"name":"unemployment"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
