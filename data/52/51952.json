The first 20 minutes or so recap his retirement, attempt at minor league baseball, and his dealing with his father's murder. It picks up when it starts looking at the huge frenzy that was his return to the NBA in the Spring of 1995. It covers his mediocre first game back against the Pacers, his Friday night Chicago return against the Magic, and his subsequent return to form with a game-winning shot against Atlanta, and a career night dropping 55 on the Knicks.","popularity":1.2747,"poster_path":"/uWRPzmCMalOW8DuYsysn0c486jz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4396,"logo_path":"/g76GCLOncS4SKIYfhWT70Zo4ypv.png","name":"NBA Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Jordan: Above and Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eriq La Salle","original_name":"Eriq La Salle","popularity":0.8605,"profile_path":"/5tV56htJbF33uc1rOmsOxXFO808.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f34d57293828e00353cb9d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Jackson","original_name":"Phil Jackson","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/tpeWFZsOhKLYEOtswSwQHdbtJ6x.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e022600d236e6001093dfb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magic Johnson","original_name":"Magic Johnson","popularity":0.4154,"profile_path":"/mchvfsi1qyhVgRKLc18Ydabzj7P.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e0225ddd1a89300148ebb7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Paxson","original_name":"John Paxson","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/zhDpuyqf0XYFEGsupLhjXWo1iVa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f34d58333ad8f0038a20a81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Haley","original_name":"Jack Haley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f34d5e8f6fd18003529ae2a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jordan","original_name":"Michael Jordan","popularity":1.8809,"profile_path":"/tCqjwlROe98wYbcRhCcp3qYsUc5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe480ec3a36847f8156143","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scottie Pippen","original_name":"Scottie Pippen","popularity":0.4308,"profile_path":"/uBzeHR11hd67PpcW7btIsfOf65n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e0225d575110d0013d9f6dc","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0219176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tIBPEZnPAR70pVPxgkuTHgtzvIy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uWRPzmCMalOW8DuYsysn0c486jz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":6496,"name":"basketball"},{"id":169055,"name":"national basketball association (nba)"},{"id":176752,"name":"basketball player"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Video Premiere","release_date":"1996-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
