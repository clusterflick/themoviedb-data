To make matters worse, he also discovers his relatives and neighbors are losing their homes as well due to shady loan practices. In an effort to keep the family afloat, all of Leo's relatives (who are universally unemployed) must move into Leo's house together. \"Subprime\" is an off beat family minefield of a comedy dealing not only with todays housing crisis and employment downturn, but also looks at life through the eyes of a young suburban adult forced to reexamine his beliefs about everything he holds dear.","popularity":0.0813,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subprime","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Miller","original_name":"Aaron Miller","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Leo Monroe","credit_id":"52fe4803c3a36847f8154255","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1697820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HD SUBPRIME THE COMEDY OFFICIAL TRAILER","key":"mB_jNuSZez0","published_at":"2010-03-09T01:52:00.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6adc3a3685448005a4f"}]}}}
