As the series routinely took the format of filming scenes in chronological order, this adds to the \"show within a show within a show\" format of the film, as viewers watch the cast perform the episodes live. The film itself ends with a \"curtain call\", as the cast comes out and Arnaz thanks the audience for their support.","popularity":1.2146,"poster_path":"/72gJukIW8hfYSyippgd7pf2AcbP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love Lucy: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Ball","original_name":"Lucille Ball","popularity":0.9088,"profile_path":"/HpqB6dUz4eqZnOjk5xEuHCvp5Y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lucy Ricardo","credit_id":"58cc9cd0c3a36851040026a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desi Arnaz","original_name":"Desi Arnaz","popularity":0.3387,"profile_path":"/5XLcxJCZYUX2t7PuCwvE9hOOYzI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ricky Ricardo","credit_id":"58cc9cde9251415a390026cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":153254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Vance","original_name":"Vivian Vance","popularity":0.2538,"profile_path":"/yQLSRUQOOM88Tunu879cYFuQTrl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ethel Mertz","credit_id":"58cc9cf89251415a390026dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Frawley","original_name":"William Frawley","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/mPCnAsN2GbBoLl34nrviZ4aCCe1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fred Mertz","credit_id":"58cc9d2bc3a368508c00278c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Sedgwick","original_name":"Edward Sedgwick","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/oy7NTpU0sODG4HpPi7xQYf60avh.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47f9c3a36847f815245f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karl Freund","original_name":"Karl Freund","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/radUQdNeGHtn7vhQOTnHBVPH2vE.jpg","credit_id":"65a0553696670e0123aba821","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0445461","wikidata_id":"Q5978113","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/T5HhHuTOJe9mgwJjWJ72qyZG11.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4CNsCUcyds6PL12mdi4FRyx2Nkv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/72gJukIW8hfYSyippgd7pf2AcbP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
