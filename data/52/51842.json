All is not as it seems on the country's most watched family game-show... Reality television has taken things to the extreme and given the public, The Knackery, a show where six contestants fight for the grand prize of 'one million pounds'. To liven things up, the producers of the show release a horde of genetically modified zombies which puts a little bit more pressure on the fighters, in this Big Brother style beat-em-up. As an undercover reporter tries to scoop the story he's been waiting for, he soon comes across a kid who has entered the arena unaware of the consequences.","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":"/rlHMRqw78QiJFiaUviZTcvT8UKC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Knackery","video":false,"vote_average":1.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iain Boden","original_name":"Iain Boden","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"552d2ba4c3a3684ad6000a0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Brown","original_name":"Andrew Brown","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"552d2bb692514138730050cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Clarke","original_name":"George Clarke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"552d2bbc9251413876004db2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Crawford","original_name":"Alan Crawford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"552d2bc2c3a368618e004d6d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graeme Livingstone","original_name":"Graeme Livingstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"552d2bc9c3a36875010005ab","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Clarke","original_name":"George Clarke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552d2b9292514107a0000b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Clarke","original_name":"George Clarke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552d2b9a92514119610009c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1785614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rlHMRqw78QiJFiaUviZTcvT8UKC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Zombie Games: The Knackery (Trailer)","key":"kTEfaLgnJC8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-24T22:57:04.000Z","id":"5f1f1fee511d0900357b119e"}]}}}
