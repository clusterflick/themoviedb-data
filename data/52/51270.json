In his first-ever movie, Wayne Dyer explores the spiritual journey in the second half of life when we long to find the purpose that is our unique contribution to the world. The powerful shift from the ego constructs we are taught early in life by parents and society—which promote an emphasis on achievement and accumulation—are shown in contrast to a life of meaning, focused on serving and giving back. Filmed on coastal California’s spectacular Monterey Peninsula, The Shift captures every person’s mid-life longing for a more purposeful, soul-directed life.","popularity":2.3722,"poster_path":"/w38wHd7mJV551FLU8bK2Xgpkc4r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6466,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lyceum Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Taking your life from ambition to meaning","title":"The Shift","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ambition to Meaning: Finding Your Life's Purpose","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Dyer","original_name":"Wayne Dyer","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/xVJFf5dMVWH2dYMXHSO67ivhzTf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself (as Dr. Wayne W.
