Now he must get rid of the body or face serious criminal charges -- on a night when he should be home studying. Tom gets assistance from Joe, a strange plumber who is quick to spout philosophy and quote Shakespeare. Joe even has a bizarre solution about how Tom can pass the bar, but his help comes at a cost.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passing the Bar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0872288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
