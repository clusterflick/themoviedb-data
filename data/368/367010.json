Fran Whiteway (Marthe Bernard, Republic of Doyle) is eighteen and a real firecracker. More than anything, Fran dreams of becoming a professional wrestler. Her single-father Whitey (Robb Wells, Trailer Park Boys) is a former-pro, aka White Lightning, with broken dreams of his own and is dead set against Fran wrestling. Fran is determined though and when Whitey's old rival Dark Thunder (Tony Nappo, Saw II) comes to town, she runs away to join his tour. Whitey is devastated and while he tries to get his daughter back, Fran learns the ropes of the wrestling game and of life itself.","popularity":1.0569,"poster_path":"/tyMIvDJBjIsAdHcM4KJwxyLu4pN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2974,"logo_path":"/m2wqMspGAiCpWRccY11LQqBf5tT.png","name":"Pope
