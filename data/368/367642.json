Since then, it has constantly been a subject for fascination and controversy. What could have pushed leftists from all over the world to fight for a cause that their governments rejected? Why did young men leave their work, their family and their country, so they could join a fight that was somehow a rehearsal for World War II? Nearly 40.000 people enlisted to defend their ideals on a foreign territory. Chronicles Of Hope doesn't intend to describe the events of the civil war in a one-tracked political mould; the human dimension is here the center of interest.","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":"/wbhkUzm6gXX5kSk3UZNJLraXxW2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doriane Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronicles of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Amat","original_name":"Jorge Amat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614edcf3904f6d00440be5b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Amat","original_name":"Jorge Amat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614edd1ce8a3e10043f8d2a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emil Weiss","original_name":"Emil Weiss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614edd68ed2ac200432593a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2910075,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ramon de Herrera","original_name":"Ramon de Herrera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614edd90af9590008e5dbdd1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281231,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Michel Humeau","original_name":"Jean-Michel Humeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614eddb523be46008fcfe968","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67655,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise London","original_name":"Françoise London","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614eddce67203d002966c83c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0459232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wbhkUzm6gXX5kSk3UZNJLraXxW2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1993-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
