In a community deep with tradition, where female genital mutilation (FGM) is still a rite of passage, these young Maasai express their frustrations at inequality by smacking cricket balls on the plains of Kenya and dreaming of life beyond their own village. Thus begins a journey all the way to England; the home of cricket. It is a journey which gives the Warriors the courage to face their elders in the hope of ending FGM.","popularity":0.1637,"poster_path":"/hB2aarW2unO4ARh2ByaCP4QTpgR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barney Douglas","original_name":"Barney Douglas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5643cdffc3a36870db003720","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barney Douglas","original_name":"Barney Douglas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5a01c3a36841aa0026b2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555745,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Boughtwood","original_name":"John Boughtwood","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5a6fc3a36841cc002790","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044499,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Douglas","original_name":"John Douglas","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/wFDJdhEUpXB07Rwu8HDpadJOztE.jpg","credit_id":"5afd5acf0e0a266eed003160","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044496,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ali Gavan","original_name":"Ali Gavan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd59f2c3a36841c8002dec","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044494,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Wilkins","original_name":"Ben Wilkins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd59c0c3a36841cc002728","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044497,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Anderson","original_name":"James Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5a48925141264e0023fb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2044498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esther Randall","original_name":"Esther Randall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5a56c3a36841c200348d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011511,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Elson","original_name":"Michael Elson","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5971c3a36841bc0030bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1389212,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julian Rodd","original_name":"Julian Rodd","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd59ccc3a36841c5002c5a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barney Douglas","original_name":"Barney Douglas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5965925141264e00237c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56626,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jamie Carmichael","original_name":"Jamie Carmichael","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd5a7c0e0a266f08002c66","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3825278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"warriorsfilm","instagram_id":"warriorsfilm","twitter_id":"warriorsfilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1019,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bZ9ZQEX7cStsiNCEXfvYwicUdDI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1814},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tcBFTZRYfe4eYu8o4OCfrF2kVN0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hB2aarW2unO4ARh2ByaCP4QTpgR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Warriors Cinema Trailer","key":"T9Jvig8k8j0","published_at":"2015-10-19T16:49:24.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5afd5b5692514126c1002513"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Warriors -
