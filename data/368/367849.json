The dictatorship in the country is followed by democracy, but the bright light of it blinds Fermin: he is displaced. At the police station, his anonymity is complete and he doesn't remember his own name. He is fitted with a past of 13 years of illegal political opposition from the police archives. When he keeps silent about the crimes of the dictator regime, he will be a free man. The woman he promised to marry, doesn't recognize him anymore, and thinks he is dead.","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":"/rgIfJm0qhT4J2u1lhtVOLSY2XyT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allarts Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ein Toter kehrt zurück","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1095017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Floria Bloise","original_name":"Floria Bloise","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zhZ9AI31FooEJvq20ulaVFQ0g46.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Doña Patricia","credit_id":"56433f2ac3a36870dd001da3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1036284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirta Busnelli","original_name":"Mirta Busnelli","popularity":0.1674,"profile_path":"/3RuAX1BwG1Px1cIFbZIUCu5avNS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tota","credit_id":"56433f399251410a4c001af3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Haas","original_name":"Tito Haas","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/atvFJeU3NHVdYhYVOfQV8EtEZxc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fermín","credit_id":"56433f4a9251410a47001c38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1502593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elio Marchi","original_name":"Elio Marchi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Leandro","credit_id":"5643415bc3a36870d6001c40","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Roffé","original_name":"Carlos Roffé","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/sE5WbAHsP36SttszUXR9W9op1Ow.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"645ba217fe077a5cafbdf422","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369502,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ricardo Rodríguez","original_name":"Ricardo Rodríguez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652d66c2a80236013767a886","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Agresti","original_name":"Alejandro Agresti","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":"/b41SE0CRRW0D1izYltdBDahSdjW.jpg","credit_id":"56433efbc3a36870ef001d6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alejandro Agresti","original_name":"Alejandro Agresti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56434146c3a36870e3001e47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46445,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Wiegmans","original_name":"René Wiegmans","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5643419ec3a36870ec001b44","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul M. van Brugge","original_name":"Paul M. van Brugge","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/nPtwxpAODX2RuWKaI1jLUQtNwul.jpg","credit_id":"5a3eb7f49251411fab012fb7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0094774","wikidata_id":"Q18417299","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJEjzB6uW7oznj291XuguzNyPub.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/yseamhde8Lusnj5Qh0YuEr8ywZW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rgIfJm0qhT4J2u1lhtVOLSY2XyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/gaVHPkVnRbjqipuejFVaKzaCksw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
