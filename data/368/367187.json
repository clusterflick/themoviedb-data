It's a poetical story about two young theatre actors who are given a task - to create an étude, to imagine a story. Through their rehearsal they are trying to recreate a true event of their life in order to find a peace in their souls. By discovering the beauty of small details in life young people are trying to get rid of their fear for death in understanding that death is a memory of one's living. The dot is the ending - and the beginning.","popularity":0.0807,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158003,"logo_path":"/58rlz0a17BkLfJKDPEvngC3O4DB.png","name":"Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Etude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clotilde Rigaud","original_name":"Clotilde Rigaud","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ywgLv8R4I3cL9FUCpod8t7WVmew.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Matilda","credit_id":"5c7cfb46925141737f4743fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1721302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simonas Storpirštis","original_name":"Simonas Storpirštis","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":"/63wPOYRGG175Qpyu6lPKYPt9RTf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dainius","credit_id":"5c7cfb7b0e0a2632160e866e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1532999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Austėja Urbaitė","original_name":"Austėja Urbaitė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/39EkXrQ22KFaKWb7tKcLtIKNbeU.jpg","credit_id":"563f2641c3a3681b54030305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas Plukas","original_name":"Vytautas Plukas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647cf2fdcf4b8b00c3d2d2d8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721306,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lina Murinaitė","original_name":"Lina Murinaitė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7cfbbc0e0a2631f50e8d2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3228076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ETIUDAS trailer 2013","key":"Aj1wKt2WLhc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-31T08:35:16.000Z","id":"5c7b5135925141634c494232"}]}}}
