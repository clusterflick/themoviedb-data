In addition to explaining to us what she did during her absence from the stage which lasted 6 years, Lise gives news of Marcel and their teenagers... who, in principle, are no longer teenagers. Vacations in the South, technology, the passage of time, and the things you absolutely have to do in your life are among the topics she covers in an absolutely hilarious way.","popularity":0.3621,"poster_path":"/wYGhJooDmrzByf6OJVvf3h0wwq0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Juste Pour Rire","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lise Dion : Le temps qui court","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lise Dion","original_name":"Lise Dion","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/9WvFceiwNWIx9xAkF7hwehFEUQk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5643c7549251410a49003314","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Courtemanche","original_name":"Michel Courtemanche","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":"/cB5e3Jlrtph7Kc0CZ7jFyTSlbEX.jpg","credit_id":"5643c6919251410a53003411","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5JYEQ8aE3tay4dVe6mrNSpmWheK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wYGhJooDmrzByf6OJVvf3h0wwq0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oEE8tbaSzZX5irUCAEE73PKNKCN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276162,"name":"stand-up comedian"},{"id":311881,"name":"comedy show"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
