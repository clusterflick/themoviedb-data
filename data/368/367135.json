On his way to renew his visa, Roberto meets an African at a railway station between China and Hong Kong. “Why is an African in China?” soon changes into a reflexive inquiry: “Why is a Mexican in China?” Roberto explores the African residents’ community in China and finds many new friends. The film is thus multi- and trans-national, with a Korean director filming the process as a Mexican resident in China explores its African community.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drifting City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1854846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim So-young","original_name":"Kim So-young","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":"/5EhaZj9R6Hkaw1fbspx0tXniEWH.jpg","credit_id":"5a73556992514105a300e086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
