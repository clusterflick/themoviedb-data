Every year on Swiss National day, August 1, the Wildheuer climb up the steep mountain of the «Hinteren Heubrig», fitted out with scythes and wearing wooden shoes with spikes, just as their ancestors did before them. They are part of a generation who have lived with the challenges of nature and survived it. In his film, Langjahr's poetic realism gives an insight into these people's experience of the simple life, the very foundation of human existence.","popularity":0.1685,"poster_path":"/QKOoBQaCwWUBmc6qV1JRhq5bEe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Langjahr-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2006-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpine Saga","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Büeler","original_name":"Anton Büeler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Anton Büeler","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab305","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Gwerder","original_name":"Albert Gwerder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Albert Gwerder","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab309","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Gwerder","original_name":"Erich Gwerder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Erich Gwerder","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab30d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alois Langenegger","original_name":"Alois Langenegger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alois Langenegger","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab311","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Langenegger","original_name":"Dominic Langenegger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dominic Langenegger","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab315","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Schelbert","original_name":"Josef Schelbert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Josef Schelbert","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab319","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Schelbert","original_name":"Toni Schelbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Toni Schelbert","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab31d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Suter","original_name":"Peter Suter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Peter Suter","credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab321","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Langjahr","original_name":"Erich Langjahr","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Langjahr","original_name":"Erich Langjahr","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab339","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85303,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Kennel","original_name":"Hans Kennel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab32d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Silvia Haselbeck","original_name":"Silvia Haselbeck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab333","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Langjahr","original_name":"Erich Langjahr","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab345","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Langjahr","original_name":"Erich Langjahr","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47f59251416c750ab33f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0873600","wikidata_id":"Q1167732","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":840,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/QKOoBQaCwWUBmc6qV1JRhq5bEe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5ZbqM2UYdeNdyCSyqIkO0TbY1B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"},{"id":10248,"name":"wildheuen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
