The swimmer and diver Lucard is interested in attractive Martin. The film follows the characters' coming out with all its difficulties, the bitter-sweet pleasures of first love and the dreadful moment when one comes down to reality and realizes that one's beloved friend has a hard way to go yet. The positive message the film tries to transmit is the somewhat common motto \"Live each day of your life as if it were your last.\"","popularity":0.4577,"poster_path":"/eDAA2Lbn3M0Tnj74iwBd0wBe1kF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8161,"logo_path":"/vqB76m8bZtK9J0i01tzDfEPkfIv.png","name":"Ellipsanime
