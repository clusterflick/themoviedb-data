Sampling the earth, indigenous and collected plant species, and leftover foods, FORMations examines the constant evolution within an ever-shifting cultural and geographical landscape; the petri-dish environment makes visible the invisible by providing a medium of growth for the microbial and bacterial communities that naturally exist within food and our overall surroundings. This enclosed environment gives metaphorical and visual connections to the often ignored or erased narratives and the layered complexities of hybrid existences that many newcomer (human and nonhuman species) experience in their respective, evolving habitats.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FORMations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4449079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jude Abu Zaineh","original_name":"Jude Abu Zaineh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658a9799e039f156f8bdda6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
