In LA the done thing is driving, whilst in Amsterdam you get on your bike and in Tokyo the main means of transport is rail. In these two video works, Junebum Park hones in on two distinct forms of getting oneself to a new location: on foot or arriving by car.  Filmed from above, both works show the graphic patterns of urban planning in the form of the white lines of zebra crossings and parking lots, being used by city dwellers. Seen from this birds-eye view the humans become like bugs and Park plays with this scale further with the introduction of his hand, about ten times larger than the ant-like people, directing the action. As the viewer we see the scene from Park’s viewpoint, as the omni-present, all-seeing entity in charge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y92aC12K4YsWLiMlt2q88rMtRA9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"III Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Junebum Park","original_name":"Junebum Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65891bfd688cd0585084b54b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y92aC12K4YsWLiMlt2q88rMtRA9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTuB5ZqoHAlfFi5bSUlBgmpIEHz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hirMrLmmiG0ttglRH5e4pCG3H6o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Junebum Park, 3 Crossing","key":"CWtldqYcl_s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-03-28T07:55:02.000Z","id":"666be919a735a9617a9be85b"}]}}}
