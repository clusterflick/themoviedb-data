Video and audio by Dean Winkler, Glenn Van Alstyne, Tom Lucke, Elaine Lewis, and Brian Aitchison.  Chirp-1 / Quantel was created in two separate effects passes: At the RPI Video Synthesizer Lab an old porno tape (on stock that was donated to us) was processed using an analog Serge modular music synthesizer to sequence the sounds and control the colorization of an analog Hern video synthesizer. The sounds are also inserted into the video, which are the stripes you see, changing with frequency. The tape from the first pass was taken to EUE Video and used to seed an analog feedback loop around a Quantel 5000 digital effects device.","popularity":0.1653,"poster_path":"/f7Q6GbHYw60ytAqpmqbVr4PNXTl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216712,"logo_path":null,"name":"RPI Video Synthesizer Lab","origin_country":""},{"id":216713,"logo_path":null,"name":"EUE/Screen Gems Video Services","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chirp-1 Quantel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339583,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brian Aitchison","original_name":"Brian Aitchison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e1e325a5157bb01b7ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Lucke","original_name":"Tom Lucke","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e4e325a515827018658","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Winkler","original_name":"Dean Winkler","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e83688cd058ab842c17","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Winkler","original_name":"Dean Winkler","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e6a2dffd85bcc454728","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glen Van Alstyne","original_name":"Glen Van Alstyne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e5e072166685aa55b22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Winkler","original_name":"Dean Winkler","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e72ea7b0e60ac8f4c65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elaine Lewis","original_name":"Elaine Lewis","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e2a4da3d4644a41aacf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Winkler","original_name":"Dean Winkler","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e8d2dffd85b8a456eea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glen Van Alstyne","original_name":"Glen Van Alstyne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65880e7a4772155add435798","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29475135","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7Q6GbHYw60ytAqpmqbVr4PNXTl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
