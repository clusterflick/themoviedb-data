Photography and Cinema were no exception.  In succession of the Cult Epics release of the 1930’s, we continue our Vintage Erotica series with rare erotic films from the 1940’s, a time when half of the world was at war. Made in France, this collection starts out with a series of lesbian films, followed by XXX-rated parodies of Santa Claus and hospital nurses, as well introducing body painting, nudist camp films and spanking, which became very popular in the 50’s.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cult Epics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vintage Erotica Anno 1940","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
