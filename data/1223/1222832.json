On the walls of caves, on Hindu Temples, in ancient scrolls, humans have celebrated the sexual act. Cinema is no stranger to eroticism, but there is a mistaken belief that erotic cinema is an invention of the past fifty years. In order to dispel this myth, we present this archive of erotic images captured by our “grandfathers' camera.” Made in France, these films feature lush backdrops and exotic costumes with settings ranging from the Orient to the era of the Musketeers. Filmed by professionals as well as amateurs (like the mysterious Mr. X) these films prove that erotica cinema is as old as cinema itself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cult Epics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vintage Erotica Anno 1930","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
