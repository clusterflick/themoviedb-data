Whilst talking via headset, he tells his friend about the terrible day he has had working on the County Lines project and how a child drug mule almost died in front of him. As he loses hope, his friend tells him how what he does matters in more ways than he can ever know, equating his good deeds to the Butterfly Effect, calling him a Butterfly on the Beat. The Officer cheers up and the two enjoy the rest of the night playing games together and talking online before he has to get up and do it all again.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly On The Beat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Johannes Palmer","original_name":"Charles Johannes Palmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65883d2b4772155a0b43af05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leif Phelps","original_name":"Leif Phelps","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/lB6XmNArV0S4oJdyGvregJNCGvz.jpg","credit_id":"65883d5de295b4284a5801cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446391,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Bellingham","original_name":"Thomas Bellingham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65883d3f4772155a0b43af18","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Johannes Palmer","original_name":"Charles Johannes Palmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65883d32688cd057b284e79c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267121,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Cameron King","original_name":"Adam Cameron King","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65883d4c325a51582701909f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28774907","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Oxford Shorts","release_date":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"London Lift-Off Festival","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
