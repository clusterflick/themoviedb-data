Grainger is remembered as the composer of Country Gardens but there was much more to him than this well-known tune. He was a great pianist who hated playing the piano, a famous composer convinced his best works were neglected, a man of deviant behavior remembered everywhere with respect and love. His contradictory character is explored through his letters, interviews with those who knew him, film and archive recordings, and his music.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/1ejSoq8ea3DCIVlpgPUR5vJGlMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Noble Savage: Percy Grainger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barrie Gavin","original_name":"Barrie Gavin","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/vd9FnvkRUcz5HXY13kX6eLCuajv.jpg","credit_id":"658bdbff66eba776613fe033","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1583,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ejSoq8ea3DCIVlpgPUR5vJGlMj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
