Suddenly, unlike the common “stag” films of the time, scripts, multiple camera angles, and title credits were introduced into erotic productions.  These extended 15-minute films were intended for private viewing in the back rooms of stores, in homes, and at local brothels. The themes of many of these films were bondage and burlesque; images similar to those produced by Irving Klaw in the U.S. The main difference being that in France the filmmakers would show on-camera sex, and nudity. These films stand out, not only for being ahead of their time, but because they transcend the standards of much of what is being produced today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cult Epics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vintage Erotica Anno 1950","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
