In 2008, Jacqueline was hit by a car while crossing the busy intersection of Cambie Street and King Edward Drive in Vancouver, Canada. Having no memory of being hit, she details the moments leading up to the collision and the disorientated thoughts afterwards. Believed to be one of the pivotal moments in her life, “Give me a Break” is a story of transition and surrender: to pain, to body, to the limitations and creativity in our lives in which we can never predict. Created for BCSC 431: Advanced Seminar in Strategic Communication: Digital Storytelling. Winner of the 2021 Emerge Media Awards video short category.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2YRAmlMAGBiTpzcL8s0rQkANC4b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Me a Break","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4448148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Ohm","original_name":"Jacqueline Ohm","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589c555e295b478fa582743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4448148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Ohm","original_name":"Jacqueline Ohm","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589c932688cd0594d840574","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4448148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Ohm","original_name":"Jacqueline Ohm","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589c6de688cd057b285c5dd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1332,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2YRAmlMAGBiTpzcL8s0rQkANC4b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":888}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
