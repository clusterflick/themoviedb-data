The boy seems strangely withdrawn and depressed to her. Robert, whose behavior can be traced back to his parental home, which lacks orderly family relationships, disrupts the lessons with his defiant and rebellious behavior. All her attempts to investigate the causes of this behavior, however, only lead to increasingly serious misunderstandings. In almost hysterical exaggeration, provoked by Robert's tormenting behavior, she finally believes that he is trying to poison her and knocks the boy down during a break. The principal of the boarding school inadvertently witnesses this incident and dismisses Miss Giehse after a heated controversy. The teacher does not overcome the shame of the dismissal and the pain of her own actions and dies on the day she has to leave the boarding school on a trip with the school bus.","popularity":0.1429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7024,"logo_path":"/r59UjG4QqARcBYrTnEKc2YIOWSI.png","name":"Sender Freies Berlin","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Else Quecke","original_name":"Else Quecke","popularity":0.2566,"profile_path":"/8mPMNWVV6SUqyuQfROpH8y6Fyv8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fräulein Giehse","credit_id":"65888b92b0cd205249587901","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Rosengarten","original_name":"Thomas Rosengarten","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"65888baa4da3d463f5420444","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hirche","original_name":"Peter Hirche","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Kovall","credit_id":"65888bbc688cd058ab843c45","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Gerhardt","original_name":"Renate Gerhardt","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Roberts Mutter","credit_id":"65888bcdb7b69d23356d5cb8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ladislaus Somogyi","original_name":"Ladislaus Somogyi","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Roberts Vater","credit_id":"65888bece295b4703558008c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2091872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Rosen","original_name":"Martin Rosen","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Chauffeur","credit_id":"65888c0c5aba3266b0b9c51d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina von Porembsky","original_name":"Nina von Porembsky","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Fräulein Zuriel","credit_id":"65888c6a07216666d4a6333d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360143,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Hasenclever","original_name":"Walter Hasenclever","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"1.
