He delved into the farm-to-table gastronomy world after working as a cook for a Montessori school in Berkley. His mission is to introduce the regional and seasonal recipes of Northern Iran, learnt from his childhood to the North American public where its ingredients geographically match California. With his wife banned from the US and a lack of distribution of Iranian food ingredients due to sanctions, he travels back and forth between Iran and the U.S., attempting to bridge the personal and political to bring back a taste of home. Alongside other renowned food figures, Hanif aims to show the depth of a unique forgotten cuisine that is connected with nature, influenced by seasons, and defines the art of preservation techniques.","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Preserving Taste","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2607810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gelareh Kiazand","original_name":"Gelareh Kiazand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65886d9cea7b0e5f708f4592","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4122057,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lianne Turner","original_name":"Lianne Turner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65886dbcb0cd2052f657ed7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3401556,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saba Alizadeh","original_name":"Saba Alizadeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65886dc92dffd85b8a458663","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Sheffield Global Cinema Festival","release_date":"2023-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
