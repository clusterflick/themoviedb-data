Rupp integrated the University of Kentucky basketball program when sophomore Tom Payne stepped on the court for UK in the 1970-71 season and Rupp was one of the first coaches in the SEC or ACC conference to recruit a black player in 1964. However he is often derided by critics who through the years have accused him of being a racist, resisting integration, among other things. Rupp was the coach at UK through the pivotal era of the 1960's when integration, both on and off the basketball court, made great strides throughout the nation. He also happened to be the most successful coach in the history of the game at the time, and was a focal point of not only people looking for integration of basketball in the South, but also of people trying to resist integration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/umnHDt18hNHoLJC2gQUxnsGivG0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Setting the record straight!","title":"Adolph Rupp: Myth, Legend and Fact","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/umnHDt18hNHoLJC2gQUxnsGivG0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":681}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
