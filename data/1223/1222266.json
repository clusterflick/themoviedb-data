There, the narrator asks viewers to \"listen to their gossip\", before demonstrating the bird’s flight in slow motion. We see a polecat feasting on gull eggs, and then a man collecting the eggs for human consumption, with the film telling us that they are considered a “delicacy” in London. Indeed, according to the British Trust for Ornithology, around 300,000 gull’s eggs were sold every year in Leadenhall Market in London during the 1930s, when London Visitors was made.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pqXfQldPcy0Em0wRRtjW8cPSDfo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaumont-British Instructional","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Visitors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Blackheaded Gull","type":"Subtitle"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1345276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Field","original_name":"Mary Field","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/cibO9zQq9xFA0PsFNCy9mKamCUZ.jpg","credit_id":"6588c9aa4da3d463f54215d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver G.
