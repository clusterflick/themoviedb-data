His youngest son Fai is hauled to safety by the space station scientist and gains great power as the Moonlight Spaceman under his tutelage. Fai returns after six years with the mission to crack down on the ring. Flying Heroine Ma Chau-wan is sent as his backup by the understandably worried scientist. The spaceman approaches neighbour Ho Kei-ming's daughter Yuk-wah in order to probe into the father's dealings with the crime ring. Ma, meanwhile, charms her way into Detective Wong's investigation squad. Fai and the detective make a narrow escape from death but are dealt another setback, with Fai's mother and Yuk-wah abducted.
