A father who loves movies likes to take his son to watch movies together. The movie opens a window to the world for his son and engraves the man’s creed about cowboys and tough guys in his heart. The rebellion and reflection brought about by growth have forced the son to rethink the absence of his mother and the education of his father. When the boy finally grows into a man, the cowboy his son once admired seems to be facing old age and physical decline. The majestic and towering mountain he fears is also crumbling. Is it trying to change or try to reconcile?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/77jTEWi6bIY4CPMlP2tcyN21YNp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446653,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Junpei Wu","original_name":"Junpei Wu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65886f34c613ce1e49dc980b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446653,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Junpei Wu","original_name":"Junpei Wu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65886f3c688cd058508477a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77jTEWi6bIY4CPMlP2tcyN21YNp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Sheffield Global Cinema Festival","release_date":"2023-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
