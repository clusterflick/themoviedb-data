In a complex and ultimately tragic tale of destructive greed, desire and toxic social hierarchy, the innkeeper’s daughter Els is forced to confront the consequences of her murderous intent in what conductor Marc Albrecht considers ‘a work of exceptional quality, concentration and significance’. Following the huge success of Korngold’s Das Wunder der Heliane (Naxos DVD 2.110584–85 / Blu-ray NBD0083V), director Christof Loy continues his exploration of strong female characters and neglected 20th-century masterpieces with this highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper Berlin production.","popularity":0.1106,"poster_path":"/dqrvOZ9xU3ofbtSsyYDhBh3eoZ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Oper Berlin","origin_country":""},{"id":77605,"logo_path":null,"name":"NAXOS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Schatzgräber","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2514400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Johansson","original_name":"Daniel Johansson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elis","credit_id":"6588bf9e5aba326759b968c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabet Strid","original_name":"Elisabet Strid","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Els","credit_id":"6588bfbce295b4717e583c94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Laurenz","original_name":"Michael Laurenz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Der Narr","credit_id":"6588bfd2e295b41dfe57f5fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuomas Pursio","original_name":"Tuomas Pursio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Der Konig","credit_id":"6588bfede295b4284a581218","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doke Pauwels","original_name":"Doke Pauwels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Die Konigin","credit_id":"6588c014c613ce6371dcac0c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Johannes Mayer","original_name":"Thomas Johannes Mayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Der Vogt","credit_id":"6588c0314772155a6a4397d4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christof Loy","original_name":"Christof Loy","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6588c09f22e4807e62c1aa83","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424085,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Olaf Winter","original_name":"Olaf Winter","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6588c0d52dffd85c8f45066c","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636825,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Schreker","original_name":"Franz Schreker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6588c057ea7b0e5e4c902f38","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955984,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Johannes Leiacker","original_name":"Johannes Leiacker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6588c0ba325a51587e016e48","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Albrecht","original_name":"Marc Albrecht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6588c07c22e4807e62c1aa78","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fMySoXlcgwHBWX1Vmo3QAFcUQSW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jpeIx0W2D4ARgHIwZkra4jMxc20.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1271,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqrvOZ9xU3ofbtSsyYDhBh3eoZ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":847}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Blu-ray and DVD release","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Franz Schreker's Der Schatzgräber (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Marc Albrecht, Christof Loy)","key":"c9W8fUhT3tQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-06T00:09:44.000Z","id":"6588c575fad8e95d768e2183"}]}}}
