The more rejection she comes in contact with the more it drives her to keep going. Michele's aims to find success and the real love of her life but keeps competing for time and criticism with her family, lovers, school moms, and co workers. She keeps running up against failures by trusting the wrong people, giving them empathy, and being at times too trusting. Michele is a fireball of energy and emotions and when taken advantage of too many times can be reactive, but always apologetically responsible for her behavior and duty to be a good mom and person. She uses these mishaps to drive her into not stopping for a better life for her and her daughter, whatever that may be.","popularity":0.0636,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66681,"logo_path":"/nTeCp7XAtGXlSXywoBum6dBThoC.png","name":"ReKon Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":236150,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'ouest","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vengeance comes from those you least expect.","title":"Just Be","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1003061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krystal Ellsworth","original_name":"Krystal Ellsworth","popularity":0.2062,"profile_path":"/htDYbWlOUNF8N70iF44IZDOfk7w.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donatella","credit_id":"66b930eaa354f786239f0ec9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3651587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Manuel","original_name":"Ryan Manuel","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Adan","credit_id":"66b930f97d739ff29e9f0666","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Persephone Apostolou","original_name":"Persephone Apostolou","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/ctsGWiQ31nYATh8zInWlPrnWNWg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"66b9310e131e2bd3bd075d78","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880107,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danna Galeano","original_name":"Danna Galeano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b9313e20498c7964d59cf4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlyn Hardy","original_name":"Caitlyn Hardy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b9315458292b19c0f97838","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043985,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gareth Paul Cox","original_name":"Gareth Paul Cox","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b9318b382fc34d66aab9ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Koteles","original_name":"Sarah Koteles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b9311f8fc8d73d5d1a2d9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Garvey","original_name":"Malcolm Garvey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b93148d0423b3fbb6dd2c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777442,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matthew Liam Nicholson","original_name":"Matthew Liam Nicholson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b931712fb4036861255b1d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Paull","original_name":"Michael Paull","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b93128253f74721b6dd359","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Just Be (2020) | Lâ€™ouest Studio | Clementine Lea Spieser","key":"oxn3FbThR5U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-20T19:24:08.000Z","id":"66b930c5dfe1b8241e6dd25f"}]}}}
