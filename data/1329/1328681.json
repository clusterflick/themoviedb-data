How do you get in, get made and make money? And what happens when you get in too deep? THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO THE MOB answers all of these questions and more by turning to the ultimate authority: former Colombo family captain Michael Franzese. Michael grew up in this world, following in the footsteps of his father, Colombo family underboss Sonny Franzese, and he earned more money for the organization than anyone since Al Capone. Michael also did what no made man has ever done before or since: he publicly quit La Cosa Nostra -- without going into witness protection -- and lived to tell the tale. This fast- paced, two-hour special takes viewers on a step-by-step journey through the world's most famous criminal organization as lived by one of its most notorious members. You'll find out exactly how the mob works -- and wonder how Michael Franzese is still alive.","popularity":0.3662,"poster_path":"/ewuz1pASBYQTojz0LY1yWmvKCd6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Definitive Guide to the Mob","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1557898,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Franzese","original_name":"Michael Franzese","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"66b99d537016621fb072d922","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3831350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Cutler","original_name":"Jim Cutler","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/fxGkgAEQtmWlj0bO7ZvkUX77yCQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66b99d6b7f880eccc99f2cfa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian M.
