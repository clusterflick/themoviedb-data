Her life imitated art with all the hallmarks of a compelling novel. She had movie star looks, a brilliant writing career and a passionate, creative and tumultuous marriage to fellow Australian writer, George Johnston. Yet the sacrifice of security for the bohemian romance of life on the Greek island of Hydra with its famous friends, including Leonard Cohen; and the parties, the drinking, the love affairs and poverty, led to her early death.","popularity":0.2897,"poster_path":"/xn3CIxuAZp6ujqBlUsGLSNzoF5y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broken Hill
