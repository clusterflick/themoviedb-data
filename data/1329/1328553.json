After a sequence showing the recruitment of workers in Tunisia itself, other immigrant workers testify to the harshness of their living conditions in France. Underlining the continuity between the anti-racist struggle and the fight against exploitation, the film follows the hunger strikers to victory, celebrated collectively in an unbridled dance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jusqu'au bout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cinélutte","original_name":"Cinélutte","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b9212647193c2930a8f467","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
