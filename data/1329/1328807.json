These posts, some shared millions of times, show soldiers humiliating bound Palestinians, ransacking their homes, joking as they detonate schools and whole districts, and laughing as they launch high explosive ordnance into densely-packed areas. The award-winning team behind this Basement Films production traveled to Israel to interview some of these soldiers, who proudly defended themselves and their videos, some expressing callous disregard for Palestinians in Gaza. Through additional interviews with Israeli radical groups, politicians, and media figures, the film reveals Israeli Jewish society in the aftermath of October 7th, gripped by a vengeance and hate that puts into question any possibility for peace.","popularity":0.7714,"poster_path":"/alJlH8iKBdViW4zuNMeZDGIeRLw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basement Films","origin_country":""},{"id":236200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeteo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey through Israeli society after months of mass violence in Gaza.","title":"Israel's Reel Extremism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inigo Gilmore","original_name":"Inigo Gilmore","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/6TQVVV6y7vKs9pyU45UJxR0AodB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Reporter / interviewer","credit_id":"66c25d2e6fcd6f5d03bf7e3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inigo Gilmore","original_name":"Inigo Gilmore","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/6TQVVV6y7vKs9pyU45UJxR0AodB.jpg","credit_id":"66ba2cc900a67f92eeb762ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Hardie Buckley","original_name":"Kate Hardie Buckley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c25c27a77c37b428d549bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892998,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kiran Alvi","original_name":"Kiran Alvi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vXZLZ7HvrLfU4wXlZGX8E0Tb6cJ.jpg","credit_id":"66c25e5ef2416017bfd0c54b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2309920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehdi Hasan","original_name":"Mehdi Hasan","popularity":0.1755,"profile_path":"/puPHraN41ytkhlP6ab0buLnIcey.jpg","credit_id":"66c25dbb214e2242e9923885","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2461577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben de Pear","original_name":"Ben de Pear","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cTF75yZpzYOFbAiefc0NyaW3406.jpg","credit_id":"66c25de25688dec13bc84649","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33319500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w4mCL4Z22cMAvwpDtZWMmISKThQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2962,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/alJlH8iKBdViW4zuNMeZDGIeRLw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":6092,"name":"army"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":14796,"name":"destruction"},{"id":176834,"name":"social media"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":275377,"name":"gaza"},{"id":296754,"name":"hate"},{"id":330961,"name":"idf"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zeteo (paid subscribers only)","release_date":"2024-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Watch the trailer for Zeteo’s new documentary: 'Israel’s ‘Reel Extremism'","key":"i9xXGqPkIYk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-01T18:29:41.000Z","id":"66ba286ab2a998faf1912731"}]}}}
