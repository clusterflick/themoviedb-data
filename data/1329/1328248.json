Here, a vintage recording of Debussy's Nocturne played by Walter Gieseking becomes the vehicle by which four lovers of the humanities hover together in a cold post-apocalyptic shack of sandbags to mourn weekly over lost art and loves gone by. Barnes, who must be considered among the greatest filmmakers ever to work in the educational world, forcibly illustrates, through flashback sequences and close-up shots, how the humanities --- music, painting, literature, and theatre --- are perhaps the most enriching of all human endeavors. Their ultimate and devastating loss may have never before or since been shown with such terrifying passion.","popularity":0.2117,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Portable Phonograph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gwynn","original_name":"Michael Gwynn","popularity":0.3691,"profile_path":"/pyklvVKyfDM1JVD1LSVrIu5U05y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Music Lover","credit_id":"66b82e2ffaf52a3506f2bf34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Squire","original_name":"William Squire","popularity":0.2202,"profile_path":"/k3HPWslxIahGKovuQLgvk3CuB8i.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Actor","credit_id":"66b82e48888b43bc4972e004","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Locke","original_name":"Philip Locke","popularity":0.4317,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Book Lover","credit_id":"66b82e68abccf76c2aaaac01","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Buck","original_name":"David Buck","popularity":0.3849,"profile_path":"/ruU1fqPWT4lvaBTyrUlne1H2Dkz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Musician","credit_id":"66b82e7f53be0481152641c8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1260595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John W.
