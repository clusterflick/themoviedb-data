I became chronically ill around halfway between these two works, and this new film can now be seen in a different context, beyond the playful, whimsical gesture for which it was originally made. This new version comments on invisible illness, grief, disappearing in plain sight, isolation and dissociation, common daily states for someone living with chronic illness.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/qe0sW0LFnMNtg8pSdiwqN6KEp8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pneuma (Revisited)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sop","original_name":"Sop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b789a890c390b24c0732a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qe0sW0LFnMNtg8pSdiwqN6KEp8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RestFest Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
