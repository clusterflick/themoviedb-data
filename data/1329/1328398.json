From there, he was sent to Mauthausen and finally to the Gusen camp, where the prisoners were forced to work for the German armaments industry under inhumane conditions. For a long time, Stanisław Zalewski, like many other victims of Nazi terror, remained silent about his painful experiences. It was only after forty years that he began to talk about it, at events, memorial services, and in schools, and he continues to do so to this day, even at the age of 99. Now, for the first time, he tells his stirring life story in a film as a deeply impressive ‘ambassador of remembrance’.","popularity":0.2864,"poster_path":"/qbJHIvzie6kjArjgFmLjXVeHuG6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236125,"logo_path":null,"name":"CEE Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ambassador of Remembrance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Botschafter des Erinnerns","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Ambasador pamieci","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanislaw Zalewski","original_name":"Stanislaw Zalewski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66b8b089ad6516b18374c47d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Zelasko","original_name":"Magdalena Zelasko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b0e8806c124c0cf6ed91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Zelasko","original_name":"Magdalena Zelasko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b0c220817ac8afaab9fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879628,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michal Koziol","original_name":"Michal Koziol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8d7821771b6558ea7dd15","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Zelasko","original_name":"Magdalena Zelasko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8d76d664dbd1625aabb55","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879634,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Lohvin","original_name":"Ivan Lohvin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8d7b7fd140196efd748a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879628,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michal Koziol","original_name":"Michal Koziol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8d79e664dbd1625aabb62","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32985851","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4mhSBS4HNyDFv4SjDLGl7HeQU0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0QQ0RYdncfJPlX2TTlWWETIzJE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9kPRFNksM5wY9rSYxdlPA6PZzJs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9YL9wwyq83v72sdX5p7EWnNTZP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7WzeHJ44mG3R33jOY7vHAC9QmW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Nqswj54lsFREEDpzDfrY9grnT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kpHVcWnj9eXVfHq5w6ep1a7TwWL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":920,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/wfOfpeyoEYUQh47VF21lvEEah6j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":651},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qbJHIvzie6kjArjgFmLjXVeHuG6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":188293,"name":"remembrance"},{"id":298724,"name":"survivor"},{"id":336023,"name":"contemporary witness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"AA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
