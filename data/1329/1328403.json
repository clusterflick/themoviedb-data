She does not get on with her peers, some of whom are prejudiced against individuals with special needs, whilst her mother makes sure all the others are kept at bay. The mother, a successful lawyer, has little patience for her daughter and her sort. One weekend, the pair head off to the countryside where Osnat’s grandmother lives. Uneducated and superstitious, Osnat’s mother is every bit as disdainful of her own mother as she is of her daughter. When a magician passes through the village, for a brief moment it seems as if the relationship between the three generations of women is about to turn a corner; however, the magician ends up disappearing as cryptically as he had appeared, leaving mother, daughter, and grandmother to find their own path to happiness.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1993-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Touch of Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezra Dagan","original_name":"Ezra Dagan","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/4wEfV3uegO3o8tpKPQ4BWVZLe16.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Magician","credit_id":"66b8b509dfe1b8241e6dceca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Fliedel","original_name":"Edna Fliedel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Grandmother","credit_id":"66b8b51a579e9174ff6dced0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aviva Ger","original_name":"Aviva Ger","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"66b8b52b7df034b9c41a264a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osnat Bar-Net Sand","original_name":"Osnat Bar-Net Sand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Osnat","credit_id":"66b8b5395b96d9a5cff2c3b0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baruch Dienar","original_name":"Baruch Dienar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b548d2ba3a679f74c4b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435615,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Savyon Liebrecht","original_name":"Savyon Liebrecht","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b56d758d41940c0766ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katriel Schori","original_name":"Katriel Schori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b57e65a0a0968a1a2a51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noemi Schory","original_name":"Noemi Schory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b592fc291244686dced6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vyacheslav Ganelin","original_name":"Viačeslavas Ganelinas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hEgJWniEMftL2ci1CTcABMaIl7b.jpg","credit_id":"66b8b5b8e72f60481caab90b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65664,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amnon Salomon","original_name":"Amnon Salomon","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b5d91f0b415555bd9dd9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101761,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rachel Yagil","original_name":"Rachel Yagil","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8b5fad16b7a7363f2c3a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29415686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
