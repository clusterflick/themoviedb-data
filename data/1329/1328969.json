Viswanatha Nayak (Krishna) is the son of Nagama Nayak (Sivaji Ganesan), a successful General of Srikrishnadevaraya (Krishnam Raju) of the Vijayanagara Empire. Chola King Veerasekhara Chola invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposes the Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan who was under the protection of Srikrishnadevaraya. Due to this, an enraged Srikrishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan.
