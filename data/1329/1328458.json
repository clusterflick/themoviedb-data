Today, just one VHS copy remains. Originally titled The Fresh Prince of Everywhere, this vandalised tape now goes as The Fresh Prince of Nowhere - and where it picked up its new name, no one knows. Seemingly resonating with an uncanny relevance to the present day, the documentary is an eerie yet meaningful lesson in love, fame and failure. In 2024, the world knows a different Will Smith to the one we knew on the cusp of the millennium. But the story of this VHS tape is a timeless reflection on the cycles of triumph, adversity, and the cost of fame.","popularity":0.2729,"poster_path":"/wmeho2nhr1bdiXxWcGcRlaFdr9e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The future is now.","title":"The Fresh Prince of Nowhere","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Smith","original_name":"Will Smith","popularity":6.8302,"profile_path":"/1QqaRZ8neYlqLx7ODZC4as47wUV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66b8db3686f5391f4fa7e3c1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4879612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny McMahon","original_name":"Danny McMahon","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8db45044d0fdee872ba51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4879612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny McMahon","original_name":"Danny McMahon","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8db5315605b765072ba4d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4879613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Bright","original_name":"Adam Bright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8db60a354f786239f0c35","department":"Writing","job":"Story Developer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1468711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Pugsley","original_name":"Dan Pugsley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8db6a758d41940c076879","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5112037,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Noble","original_name":"Matt Noble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758efe0a6347ac4d38739d6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPUP70sPdV9l0otMf23lFNng0nF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wmeho2nhr1bdiXxWcGcRlaFdr9e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1875}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
