These forests and rivers, together with heath-lands and moors, are home to a diverse fauna. Martens, badgers, wild boars, hares, roe deer, red deer and wild boars, even black grouse and hazel deer find shelter in these parts. Wolves have also have a dominant presence, not to mention those who live underground, such as lizards, bats, and snakes. Accompany us on a journey where we explore every corner of this rugged land. Climb underground into the Bergisches Land, through the vast hidden cave systems that sprawl far beneath the forests. There is also much to be discovered in the water, dive with us in crystal clear streams and rivers with their diverse flora and fauna.","popularity":0.5962,"poster_path":"/w9NeMvPXXYOXxQnMFAuiG8UqIgq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tesche-Dokumentarfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":229584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westdeutscher Rundfunk","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Germany's Mystic Forest","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bendelow","original_name":"Paul Bendelow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66b7fcb27f880eccc99ee325","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300206,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigurd Tesche","original_name":"Sigurd Tesche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7fd046297e5cefc1dbad3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3331119,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beatrix Stoepel","original_name":"Beatrix Stoepel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7fc8ff44005314c07398f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gl5xYwN3ygQ5uElGT8HHXLwAwON.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w9NeMvPXXYOXxQnMFAuiG8UqIgq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":238997,"name":"fauna"},{"id":241221,"name":"wild life"},{"id":251893,"name":"national forest"},{"id":257318,"name":"threatened ecosystem"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":274835,"name":"ecosystem"},{"id":305903,"name":"animal documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 5","release_date":"2024-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
