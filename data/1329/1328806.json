Nearly 700,000 curious people go there every year. To attract even more people, PAL is embarking on gigantic work with the construction of an extraordinary hotel. This new high-end accommodation is based on a very fashionable concept: sleeping close to the animals. We also follow the reception of white rhinoceroses, the difficult integration of giraffes, and the births of baby wolves, but also, extremely rarely, that of a baby elephant.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/edpdCGq5J7ExbLXm5BoJ1tQTRwm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141651,"logo_path":"/w4KmmdBeikYNCkl4r2O3mRd28ho.png","name":"RMC Story","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Pal : au coeur du zoo le plus insolite de France","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Le Pal: in the heart of the most unusual zoo in France","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4881178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Bennet","original_name":"Arnaud Bennet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66ba2502758d41940c078d74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4881215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérome","original_name":"Gérome","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66ba2790382fc34d66aadc34","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3100426,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Guillaume Comtet","original_name":"Guillaume Comtet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ba257ee66eef8ea06c4d14","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4881161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier LUPCZYNSKI","original_name":"Olivier LUPCZYNSKI","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ba233b07f47d9e32539df1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3100426,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Guillaume Comtet","original_name":"Guillaume Comtet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ba237620384dfcff30a308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4881161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier LUPCZYNSKI","original_name":"Olivier LUPCZYNSKI","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ba2596d5cf262af6258422","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3lWw176Laq7IngsMmYxhPRjJJv6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edpdCGq5J7ExbLXm5BoJ1tQTRwm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
