Atop, as a separate layer, comes the filmmaker’s voiceover where she shares a recipe for Central Asian cultural food in her broken German language. Through the lens of food and language, addressing white European feminist perspective, the film delves into the intersection of personal history and cultural identity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hS6MfmnDeFLhxlP84kyj71Ke3gQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hazm kardan dushvor ast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazira Karimi","original_name":"Nazira Karimi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b8d33c395589ffab171463","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1095,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hS6MfmnDeFLhxlP84kyj71Ke3gQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
