The narrative will always grow bigger than the film. The film is limited by its frame and duration, but the narrative is not. The most important part of the story will always stay out of the film. Even if 'Émigré' film has a narrative, the author of the film wouldn’t want to know it. Using reality, 'Émigré' is creating its own fiction.'Émigré' is emitting the sound of political silence, there is something to be said, but it’s better to keep silent over such things. There are words that wanted to be outspoken, but it’s not yet possible to pronounce them. However, despite the will of the film, the character’s statement is developing through the scenes and is to be outspoken. The more 'Émigré' resists the narrative, the more narrative persists and finally reveals itself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Émigré","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasha Vetkin","original_name":"Yasha Vetkin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ba626f9c2e19b0d81ad8d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4881805,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Gershtein","original_name":"Michael Gershtein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ba6616d65975cd9c05fcb6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Émigré","key":"156914567","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-02-26T23:45:32.000Z","id":"66ba65f8b2a998faf19128fb"}]}}}
