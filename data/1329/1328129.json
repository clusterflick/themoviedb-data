She's a senior at local high school. She's dreaming of entering university. The final exams are approaching, and this has even bigger meaning for her than to many others, because after the graduation she is obliged to move out from the orphanage. Geri starts to go through her past with her stepbrother; the domestic violence behind the breakup of the family. She would love to know why her mother abandoned her and why she was not given to a foster family but had to grow up at the orphanage. She hesitates should she invite the mother to her prom. Geri also had a boyfriend who wanted her to quit the school and emigrate to Germany. He returns for the prom. The prom night is wonderful, full of hope and joy, but there are new twists of fate looming around the corner. Can Geri overcome her past or repeat the family's old mistakes in different form?","popularity":0.1011,"poster_path":"/cUtUZZ0WAzJBHitYO1ZHUwj3IcC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making Movies","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":114919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soul Food","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geri's Wish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Stanishev","original_name":"Alexander Stanishev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d9ff016b7bdc10f29e55","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Stanishev","original_name":"Alexander Stanishev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d98929785eceea596836","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonislav Hristov","original_name":"Tonislav Hristov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/o3ixE85DWd1XFHtg1dxWMiMInjQ.jpg","credit_id":"66b7d96c0c5cb94fe0283594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191656,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Momchil Bozhkov","original_name":"Momchil Bozhkov","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d9a88fd5b6a19aa8c9ed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191664,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Veselin Zografov","original_name":"Veselin Zografov","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d9b49b475ea0e111cd4d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176270,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Stanoeva","original_name":"Andrea Stanoeva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d9e8025af75b0a76e335","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Petar Dundakov","original_name":"Petar Dundakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d999fb1d735878a7bc98","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kaarle Aho","original_name":"Kaarle Aho","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7d9dbafaf2cf51e596791","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1900057,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todor G.
