These lines, usually hidden by the projector gate, are revealed as subject matter and as a means of dividing the screen into as many as four very wide images, stacked one above the other. They represent many places, and a few people. My intent was to find ways to allow the images to interact in ways not usually possible. The track includes some Irish fiddle solos and intense recycled dialog.","popularity":0.0551,"poster_path":"/yt4rVOvMzMIg8tfYrVB9ClzvLY1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horizontal Boundaries","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat O'Neill","original_name":"Pat O'Neill","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/AaS3vp38O3zxHWZhGbG4EO9pmRu.jpg","credit_id":"532b65fdc3a3684bce00012c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0161674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yt4rVOvMzMIg8tfYrVB9ClzvLY1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3vC74LL0NYXkuVbiovMt03nliEH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
