Clara's father was a Communist who fought the Nazis in Argentina and possessed a list of the top Nazi exiles and their contacts. Through a former lover, Clara -- a successful broadcast journalist -- begins to see her Jewish roots (and the leftists) in a whole new light. Meanwhile, the political storms sweeping through Argentina are setting the stage for the Peronist government to come.","popularity":0.3969,"poster_path":"/9jYfoXrCCcNFC2B8Pmzp7fGpjCM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raúl de la Torre
