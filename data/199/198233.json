I just killed a lot of people. It's not good. This medal is for the people who couldn't return their homes, not for me.' Even many soldiers who received the decoration still have deep scars in their hearts now. He is the veteran of 442nd Regimental Combat Team in WW2 composed of Japanese Americans, who were at first seen as the problem because of their race, but later seen as problem solvers because of their splendid achievements on the battle field. They had to fight not only the enemy but also prejudice. This is the story of the 442nd and their veterans now and then.","popularity":0.3244,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live with Honor, Die with Dignity","title":"442: Live with Honor, Die with Dignity","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"442","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"442 Live with Honor Die with Dignity","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Inouye","original_name":"Daniel Inouye","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/zgr3fd4x3OLYTPCq1Lvpn6nfAQd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d749251416c91116a99","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Junichi Suzuki","original_name":"すずきじゅんいち","popularity":0.6503,"profile_path":"/wuDq6aKAMo5nfw7Mm4xsrNMxqlJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d749251416c91116a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178624,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shigeto Terasaka","original_name":"Shigeto Terasaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d749251416c91116a89","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178626,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toru Mihara","original_name":"Toru Mihara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d749251416c91116a95","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178625,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Masashi Kobuchi","original_name":"Masashi Kobuchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6002853b1c635b0055efe9b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1653647","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":13065,"name":"soldier"},{"id":18441,"name":"japanese stereotype"},{"id":181089,"name":"japanese american"},{"id":186212,"name":"medal of honor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
