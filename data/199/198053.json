In his opinion, the steep mountain pastures are not suited for agriculture. Most of the villagers agree. However some begin to cultivate. Even after all his fellow farmers have given in and have started to plant cops, Tanner continues his opposition and ignores all letters and instructions. This leads to a series of reprimands, for instance, some of his hay is seized and his wife cannot buy at the local grocer's since the family won't comply with the government policy.","popularity":0.2303,"poster_path":"/nUsWGbm3OW1zTgSqNzpenjEe8q7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1986-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tanner","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Kartoffelkrieg","type":"video"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Betschaft","original_name":"Susanne Betschaft","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Leni Tanner","credit_id":"52fe4d6c9251416c91115839","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Moor","original_name":"Max Moor","popularity":0.2309,"profile_path":"/yoD7vQ5MDeYP5KvcP99DQsAnAe3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d6c9251416c9111583d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliana Heimberg","original_name":"Liliana Heimberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anna Tanner","credit_id":"52fe4d6c9251416c91115841","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietmar Schönherr","original_name":"Dietmar Schönherr","popularity":0.2693,"profile_path":"/qfRHRZfuOYJAcWfJS6cve9cBbt2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Steiner","credit_id":"52fe4d6c9251416c91115845","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Steiger","original_name":"Renate Steiger","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Agnes Tanner","credit_id":"52fe4d6c9251416c91115849","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Mächtlinger","original_name":"Otto Mächtlinger","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tanner","credit_id":"59dabab4c3a36861a304b4fe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Volker Prechtel","original_name":"Volker Prechtel","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/kBNe9UD2doAGhWeNWSdFTlFMM3r.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59dabac3925141250504abb6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gempart","original_name":"Michael Gempart","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/r6VggY2FEkiD2OLxEzYWYQnjKH1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59dabad0925141250504abc7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2065784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Rieck","original_name":"Eva Rieck","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":"/7nEQ7fYntuaZvxI6zS3VgtNTCS2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5b24e92ac3a36841f30048e8","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Koller","original_name":"Xavier Koller","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/jDpThZNrm6vMOE6MHu8UDq5FrSw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d6c9251416c91115835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0143860","wikidata_id":"Q18604472","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nUsWGbm3OW1zTgSqNzpenjEe8q7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
