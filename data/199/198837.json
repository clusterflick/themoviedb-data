Anastasio is rumored to have died after an incident with a mirror and a violent confrontation after literally crowing as a cock amongst his chicken followers. The afterlife is shown as a casino where Anastasio strong-arms his way into heaven. Divination is used to find the next dictator, and a sailor and his black, peasant sidekick find themselves attempting to start a revolution with an organ, dragging it through the countryside, as the movie explores the country, culture and music.","popularity":0.1727,"poster_path":"/6oEIhcxb3lhbT4Np45R5HmulVi5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
