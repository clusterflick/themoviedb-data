Seeking out a rich uncle, the idealistic nephew is rejected by his miserly relation, and he goes on to get involved with a shady woman and a band of gun runners who supply arms for the revolution of the week. Charles and his new girlfriend head for the border after a shootout with federal troops, and a kindly railroad worker hides the couple in an abandoned copper mine. Charles is later thrown in prison while the girl becomes a concubine, but her violator is killed when Charles escapes to rescue her and exact revenge. A pretty harrowing composition could be written by the young couple on \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation.\"","popularity":0.4028,"poster_path":"/nfgR7VhrqwMjgxZd5X1ra7vUcOA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Franco London
