Ironically, the doctor's life is not a very happy one either, and his boast has a hollow sound. For one thing, although he seemingly has a \"happy divorce,\" in which he, his ex-wife and her new husband are all great pals, it's not true. He wants his wife back. All sorts of complications arise out of these lies and distortions.","popularity":0.5306,"poster_path":"/lfEoDPt7ROYLgQiKylrBxX51eF8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7248,"logo_path":null,"name":"UGC Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1975-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Happy Divorce","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"En Lykkelig Skilsmisse","type":"Dansk"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"A Happy Divorce","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Rochefort","original_name":"Jean Rochefort","popularity":0.5365,"profile_path":"/wyvdO0ih9mwLE3UHCy8GudqnKTK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean-Baptiste Morin, læge","credit_id":"58125a42c3a368798d018127","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bulle Ogier","original_name":"Bulle Ogier","popularity":0.5224,"profile_path":"/lS4b8sdG6u2IBo7cBPTqNSqAq2O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marguerite, Morins tidligere kone","credit_id":"58125a63c3a3687477017787","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Dussollier","original_name":"André Dussollier","popularity":0.5342,"profile_path":"/rw3J5sNFr7VYvTKAPak9d14F7R6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"François Winter, journalist","credit_id":"58125a7cc3a3687a9d01b3ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","original_name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":"/7jp7HehQgxpG8GknoKIIBrZIxow.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Antoine, skuespiller","credit_id":"58125a96925141568001b264","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Lise Gabold","original_name":"Anne-Lise Gabold","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/id0KzSokFWCUaayj0dFHGpJJLiz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sylvie","credit_id":"58125aacc3a3687b18018d04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Étienne Bierry","original_name":"Étienne Bierry","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/mXEdhcN563xDdC9qDiLN9lrZycZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"58125ac6925141571e01afa0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Lafont","original_name":"Bernadette Lafont","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/eN4yXWW69DE0XpfKG09pziQclJ4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jacqueline, klinikdame","credit_id":"58125adfc3a368798a01a7ac","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236991,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benny Andersen","original_name":"Benny Andersen","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/mH6WdTm7i1HUIt4aS3fe7sQ3c0h.jpg","credit_id":"621fe1266f43ec006d52314c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henning Carlsen","original_name":"Henning Carlsen","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/tuDZNAEGJkwOiI6N5YALsm1yEk7.jpg","credit_id":"621fe12f77b1fb006cfe7454","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henning Carlsen","original_name":"Henning Carlsen","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/tuDZNAEGJkwOiI6N5YALsm1yEk7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d7f9251416c911183bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125384","wikidata_id":"Q4657248","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/44iL3aBa2N5sTDSqk7qz93TJk1W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lfEoDPt7ROYLgQiKylrBxX51eF8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bVYjuSScEMemuQpdFnQ9C0m7Dre.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":230201,"name":"lykkelig"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
