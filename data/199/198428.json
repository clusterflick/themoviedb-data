Exquisitely photographed and filled with archetypal figures to create a poetic look at nature's revenge against those who would exploit her.

But for every tree planted, the rapacious state destroys many more for firewood and lumber.","popularity":0.1333,"poster_path":"/tivE9fdgTmp8SzFaE8HdunCrjgf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8492,"logo_path":"/wYhNCpXIThYDXevad6n90vsMXZ2.png","name":"RTP","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":187080,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministère
