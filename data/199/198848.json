With the death of his father-in-law and the illness of his wife, Morev becomes the new owner of \"Nicotiana\" and rules with an iron fist, resulting in massive labour strikes and murder. He ropes Irina back into his life, first as a mistress and later as his second wife, but his ambitions still come first as he plans on emerging as the biggest tobacco seller once the war is over. Irina’s love for Boris is fading and she finds a lover in one of the Germans Boris is trying to strike a deal with. Set against the backdrop of World War II and communist partisans fighting against the Nazi-allied Bulgarian monarchy, the film is a screen adaptation of the Bulgarian classic novel \"Tobacco\" released in 1954.","popularity":0.4591,"poster_path":"/xAGj96FNr2iaQnyQkvC0NwrgfzB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana
