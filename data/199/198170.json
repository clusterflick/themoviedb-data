The film conjures her with a phantasmagoric seance in the suite at the hotel Waldorf Astoria in New York where she lived in the 1950s. Her presence is reproduced by three algorithms: the camera becomes her eyes, a computer reconstructs the prosody of her voice and a robot recreates her handwriting. The dead is incarnated in an image.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marilyn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Parreno","original_name":"Philippe Parreno","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d719251416c9111638f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
