Mattia Pascal is a downtrodden average man, treated like trash by his fiancée, scorned by his associates, and cheated out of his inheritance by contemptuous relatives. The dispirited Pascal heads to Monte Carlo, accruing a fortune and also assuming the identity of a less fortunate gambler who killed himself. The \"new\" Pascal is treated with a dignity and respect that overwhelms him--and nearly kills him.","popularity":0.9421,"poster_path":"/5QuLt0Y7BDdS6ljz0NzVHf33Yxn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1042,"logo_path":"/cv8uj3G9fhe7vifZB6yjTzqI45V.png","name":"Cinecittà
