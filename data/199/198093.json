She prefers to convince her students with arguments rather than punishments. But it can also be very specific: For example, when it comes to averting the advances of her problem student Niklas. He has fallen in love with her, much to the grief of his girlfriend and classmate Lisa. On a school trip, the situation comes to a head, Andrea feels increasingly pressurized by Niklas. Her husband Michael is not much help in this situation - the dentist has just started a new job and only his research in mind. Jealous Lisa tells in school that they do have a relationship, which makes their marriage very much tested.","popularity":0.3796,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stille Post","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Karven","original_name":"Ursula Karven","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/3IVP7lmpcm1EM9m20cUdQVyd7Wq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Andrea Jahn","credit_id":"54f5ba779251412ba90021fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Milberg","original_name":"Axel Milberg","popularity":0.256,"profile_path":"/eK1Kkda8rOZMgo5BYBUVeYenOwj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michael Jahn","credit_id":"54f5ba88c3a36835000024f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Gastdorf","original_name":"Johanna Gastdorf","popularity":0.3667,"profile_path":"/bIUOlSi3YDLFY5Xncdhl9tqPQGk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ingrid Hoch","credit_id":"54f5baa7c3a36834f7002375","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrin Sass","original_name":"Katrin Sass","popularity":0.5823,"profile_path":"/qvFBCUkcG9FKk9b7U9l6yFffDXp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gwendolyn Scherbach","credit_id":"54f5bab89251412ba4002328","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergej Moya","original_name":"Sergej Moya","popularity":0.3144,"profile_path":"/rOTaoIk2jhVLyjtsAtbbiQ5zmuQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Niklas Matuschek","credit_id":"5a692e069251414a2b0083be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Breite","original_name":"Oliver Breite","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/fHHHzkGvrQ0lc9g1WsH0EuUpnq1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Roland Häcker","credit_id":"5a692e1b0e0a260d7b008a8a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isolda Dychauk-Ott","original_name":"Isolda Dychauk","popularity":0.3069,"profile_path":"/u2pVocAgoj1xmHfbsLwhOfNZqC4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lisa Benz","credit_id":"5a692e270e0a260d7b008a9b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hanemann","original_name":"Michael Hanemann","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":"/l8YfICea0iskfIP8NfIQslyuIZB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Karl Matuschek","credit_id":"5a692e3fc3a3685a79007dc1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pleva","original_name":"Anton Pleva","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Benno Tielsch","credit_id":"5a692e4e9251414a2e008332","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Morten Uhlenbrock","original_name":"Tim Morten Uhlenbrock","popularity":0.1427,"profile_path":"/5vbQRQNpM4nMNlEp2k77xQgdCX2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rainer Stegmüller","credit_id":"5a692e699251414a2800808c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Tiefenbacher","original_name":"Matthias Tiefenbacher","popularity":0.2499,"profile_path":"/bBAMTanhB6sEo8De4r3PuXNtFG2.jpg","credit_id":"54f5ba649251412bb60022fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Oliver Walendy","original_name":"Thomas Oliver Walendy","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce40a85c3a3683bd81e4fa9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1298608","wikidata_id":"Q105758294","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
