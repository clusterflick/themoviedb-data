At nine o'clock in the morning, José Luis waits at the Atocha station for his girlfriend, Mari Carmen. The couple has deceived their families, who have told that they will eat in the Faculty. The journey is eternal and the stay in the city, rather than surprise them, as they expected, immerses them, even more, in the monotony in which they live. Without friends, without relatives and without university partners, the couple will spend twelve hours in Toledo, half a day of tenderness in the rain and the December sun that will help them to know themselves better.","popularity":0.3643,"poster_path":"/tuTF3Lk4hNczzKcNp8gy04NXMlF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jet
