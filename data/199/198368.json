Jason \"Worm\" Truitt has a young daughter that he loves dearly - and a beautiful girlfriend that he feels is out of his league. Worm is always doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, taking odd jobs for shady men, and even breaking the law from time to time. He is constantly tailed by the local Sheriff, and constantly berated by his own Father and friends. The film plays out as a Southern Neo-Noir of sorts. A modern day \"whodunit\" tale told using a chest-mounted Snorricam. The audience journeys with Worm as he tries to clear his name and make safe the ones he loves. Along the way, he is entangled in a small town crime syndicate and nearly loses the people that mean the most to him. Did he commit this heinous crime? Will his past sins catch up to him? Only God knows.","popularity":0.5448,"poster_path":"/2MZM5veQQwhYgYt9DV2QY330O0p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60014,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Small Instrument Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":60013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highway 7 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Worm","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Bowser","original_name":"Andrew Bowser","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/t2SkfyenBNq28GXLu4Rl3WEuQdW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Worm","credit_id":"52fe4d7b9251416c91117957","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2128839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Pollock","original_name":"Drew Pollock","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maverick","credit_id":"5ea5208ddb72c00026bd3f6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rett Terrell","original_name":"Rett Terrell","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Miller","credit_id":"5ea521c2713ed4001f53f694","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keir O'Donnell","original_name":"Keir O'Donnell","popularity":0.6228,"profile_path":"/3s08QlRwgqhd2YWLHzTfnjlLNlv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dustin (Voice)","credit_id":"5ea5230ea2d2e90021ddb338","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Bowser","original_name":"Andrew Bowser","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/t2SkfyenBNq28GXLu4Rl3WEuQdW.jpg","credit_id":"55c221de9251410f780050a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067112,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle De Long","original_name":"Michelle De Long","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea5252ea2d2e9001adda94e","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Bowser","original_name":"Andrew Bowser","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/t2SkfyenBNq28GXLu4Rl3WEuQdW.jpg","credit_id":"5ea52468713ed4001d53f097","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Bowser","original_name":"Andrew Bowser","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/t2SkfyenBNq28GXLu4Rl3WEuQdW.jpg","credit_id":"5ea52414a2d2e90018ddbf24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2543930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2MZM5veQQwhYgYt9DV2QY330O0p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Worm - Teaser Trailer (2013)","key":"OoxQrD94xmY","published_at":"2013-05-15T08:39:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"55bf668fc3a3686526006578"}]}}}
