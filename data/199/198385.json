The star surgeon Prof. Gerhard Harrer works here. Katrin has known and admired the professor since her assistantship. But then her heroic image of Professor Harrer begins to falter. The young doctor seems to be the only one to notice that the luminary apparently has an alcohol problem. But nobody believes you. When Harrer finally collapses in the middle of an operation, he is suspended from duty. Katrin stands by him, but more problems are waiting in the clinic.","popularity":0.5409,"poster_path":"/5Fh96z2LdZB4mOxkpQwYIphb0bX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vollnarkose","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klausjürgen Wussow","original_name":"Klausjürgen Wussow","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/bca6bui8cuyAQKshbr87wMQ9MFA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Professor Harrer","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne von Borsody","original_name":"Suzanne von Borsody","popularity":0.3729,"profile_path":"/c9cODGouFyrkMuVZCdV5SdFDRAw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Klein","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Jäger","original_name":"Julia Jäger","popularity":0.31,"profile_path":"/2XzL2aVhY0oIMRTcemlj9NTJNxW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anja Matthes","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c1d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Strecker","original_name":"Rainer Strecker","popularity":0.2541,"profile_path":"/hvqymg1NJfuLa3ZlWFYfPspLr14.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"David","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Bergmann","original_name":"Tim Bergmann","popularity":0.1419,"profile_path":"/fiG7mlE61ySNaPxV3W5XlfhbvBN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Schöne","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c25","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gudrun Ritter","original_name":"Gudrun Ritter","popularity":0.2795,"profile_path":"/oUF2RCYPNStagb1kdalCkEEKLnA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Birte","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c29","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunter Schoß","original_name":"Gunter Schoß","popularity":0.2087,"profile_path":"/nuc2jxGdLAJWlFEy5Cip9AAkQJK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dr. Radke","credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c2d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Probst","original_name":"Peter Probst","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":292198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bodo Fürneisen","original_name":"Bodo Fürneisen","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d7c9251416c91117c0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0134233","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/tNzvsIMZwu1cIJbrJP0ZjcTrNI1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5Fh96z2LdZB4mOxkpQwYIphb0bX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11612,"name":"hospital"},{"id":208788,"name":"medical drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
