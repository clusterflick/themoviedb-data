On his way to the hotel in Tel Aviv after landing at the airport, the son Mike (Seymour Gitin) gets invited to spend some time with the cab driver's family. Before he has time to experience jet lag, the unwanted attentions of a female in the hotel send Mike packing. He ends up with the cabbie's family, a mixed group presided over by an authoritative matriarch (Batya Lancet). She sees no reason why one of her marriageable daughters should not hook up with this millionaire Mike, but Mike has already lost his heart to a model on a magazine cover -- quite a sticky wicket.","popularity":0.3351,"poster_path":"/nyRROJLCDX4mn9JqDxtSjScG9ue.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1961-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Like Mike","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Batya Lancet","original_name":"Batya Lancet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Yaffa Arieli","credit_id":"534fbe9d0e0a267ea1000cf1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gideon Singer","original_name":"Gideon Singer","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Benjamin Arieli","credit_id":"534fbea80e0a267ea4000d21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeev Berlinsky","original_name":"Zeev Berlinsky","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":"/lickxvcpsTSvwuKyocJMVo2rmrY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yaakov","credit_id":"534fbeb80e0a267eab000c5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Topol","original_name":"Topol","popularity":0.3141,"profile_path":"/Ah6ZOrg9AmeqPU04qUGF5eon2Fv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Micha","credit_id":"534fbee50e0a267ea4000d2f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilana Rovina","original_name":"Ilana Rovina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tamar Arieli","credit_id":"6536ac6b8cfcc700aa039a0f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meira Shor","original_name":"Meira Shor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tzip Arieli","credit_id":"6536ae6ec14fee00c6eefdaf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seymour Gitin","original_name":"Seymour Gitin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"6536af09c8a5ac00c50b0225","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geula Nuni","original_name":"Geula Nuni","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nili","credit_id":"6536af7fc8a5ac00e2b817b5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Frye","original_name":"Peter Frye","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/AdLZvD8bFR3QVtp48ijrUvoe2Nx.jpg","credit_id":"534fbe590e0a267eb9000cfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310686,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aharon Meged","original_name":"Aharon Meged","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534fbe7a0e0a267ea1000ce9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Frye","original_name":"Peter Frye","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/AdLZvD8bFR3QVtp48ijrUvoe2Nx.jpg","credit_id":"534fbe890e0a267eb6000c80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0137009","wikidata_id":"Q5977971","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/nyRROJLCDX4mn9JqDxtSjScG9ue.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":721}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
