Moving Pictures opened them to a mass audience for the first time and remains the biggest selling album of their career. It also went to No.1 in Canada and went quadruple platinum there while hitting No.3 in both the UK and USA. Rush members Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart talk us through the making of the albums, together with original producer Terry Brown via interviews, demonstrations, archive videos and use of the original multi-track tapes.","popularity":2.2875,"poster_path":"/3lHI8Ko59dXoKabttbD2XwDvwuD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":14519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isis Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: Rush - 2112 & Moving Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Lifeson","original_name":"Alex Lifeson","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/7daAAB0ZXXsq82IxdBPoCFcyoOz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geddy Lee","original_name":"Geddy Lee","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/raaVKa1Dr29hLCZhY7ryOsaNSqx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Peart","original_name":"Neil Peart","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/q5VO9FDmiG7iz36SBfj5m1UfH33.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Hawkins","original_name":"Taylor Hawkins","popularity":0.2962,"profile_path":"/cQPUR6JrhXvCFDPTHhf1q9SQPs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Brown","original_name":"Terry Brown","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/isB3PzBO5uwbv6mQKR4tJC6Qh5L.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb605","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031801,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andy Walter","original_name":"Andy Walter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb601","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Longfellow","original_name":"Matthew Longfellow","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick De Grunwald","original_name":"Nick De Grunwald","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102304,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joss Crowley","original_name":"Joss Crowley","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/sYot63RgsT6fuyFMdMqFpws4tlg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49089251416c750bb5f5","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":995506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin R.
