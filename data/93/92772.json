His new assistant, Shirly Mai, is an attractive and conscientious woman who embodies a quality of virtue that her boss gave up a long time ago. They have both been assigned to solve a series of gruesome murders that have been taking place in Berlin's drug and prostitution ganglands. The prime suspect is George Miskowski, a pusher who supplies Berlin's brothels and hookers with cocaine and heroin.","popularity":1.2542,"poster_path":"/4zTbPAUy2klgyWGWraM07JMvU76.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81480,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.S.
