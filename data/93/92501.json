In the name of promoting safe driving in teenagers, these films became notorious for their gory depiction of accidents to shock their audiences to make their point. The film also covers the role of safety films of this era, their effect on North American teenage culture, the struggle between idealism and lurid exploitation and how they reflected the larger society concerns of the time that adults projected onto their youth.","popularity":0.8578,"poster_path":"/jERpn7kbYxv6WIrwXtjqBNganj6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Livin' Man Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell's Highway: The True Story of Highway Safety Films","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John P.
