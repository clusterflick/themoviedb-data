To overcome these dreary thoughts, she decides to find out about him and the other men who danced with her during a ball that was a turning point in her life, many years ago. She pays a visit to those forgotten acquaintances one after the other; Christine is not only surprised to see how they have fared, but also discovers the impact she had, unknowingly, on the feelings and the destiny of these persons.","popularity":0.445,"poster_path":"/9cSKDlW2zatHjzXH786pCCXOTLw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions
