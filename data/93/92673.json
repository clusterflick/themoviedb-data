These sons quickly overrun the city of Tuleda and take prisoner Princess Bianca, though young Prince Alessio escapes. Hercules comes to the rescue of Bianca, winning her freedom in a tournament in exchange for becoming a slave himself. Forces from the West soon come to re-take Tuleda and Hercules -- freed from his bonds -- helps to dispatch Genghis Khan's three sons while again saving Bianca and reuniting her with her young brother.","popularity":0.6981,"poster_path":"/dC1UoLpV71l8CpBRL3mjD61YasE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jonia
