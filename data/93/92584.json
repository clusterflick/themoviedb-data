It opens with a dramatization of her first, amateur recording session, with young Lauren Frost playing a part described in the credits as \"Young Girl,\" though Streisand later refers to her as \"mini-me.\" Frost doesn't get too far before being joined by Streisand herself on a stirring version of \"Something's Coming\" from West Side Story. The rest of \"Act One\" traces Streisand's career from her club days to her movie performances. \"Act Two\" has less of a narrative structure, though it is equally autobiographical, with Streisand displaying and commenting on videos of herself performing with other stars and building up to the stroke of midnight with a combination of old, recent, and new specially written songs. At 57 that night, Streisand remains in good voice.","popularity":1.8407,"poster_path":"/luVzc7YGkz7m2b3i2CxOV4yAAw2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Music
