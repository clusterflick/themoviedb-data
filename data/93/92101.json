That’s right. Made in 1995 by the band when Jack Irons was drummer and filmed over the course of their 1995 Far-East tour in Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand…it’s half tour documentary and half movie. This movie was apparently scrapped by the band at the final mixing stage for some unknown reason, seems completely unedited/uncut. It full of really wild and weird little skits by the band (like Ed and Jack acting out some strange Godzilla attack on the beach, Mike McCready's stage strip-tease), airplane, backstage & soundcheck footage of all the band members, the band on the streets & taking in the culture of the countries they’re visiting.","popularity":0.5135,"poster_path":"/67H5T8BuhL39LS3yKzMSBlStPmW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pearl Jam: Sponsored By No One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pearl Jam - Sponsored By No One","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pearl Jam: The Movie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pearl Jam: Vitalogy tour","type":"alt"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Vedder","original_name":"Eddie Vedder","popularity":0.5308,"profile_path":"/26yDfC30UvaYHwVvfl61q3dokYo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48f09251416c750b8329","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stone Gossard","original_name":"Stone Gossard","popularity":0.1746,"profile_path":"/eOzop1Yhx1vVXA7xkuksPPAAks6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48f09251416c750b832d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Ament","original_name":"Jeff Ament","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/uPavu55MOQEEqgjA0rVpsoKlZDB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48f09251416c750b8331","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike McCready","original_name":"Mike McCready","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/dVz5KWgeifIfJwlmhGBA7OixXoE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48f09251416c750b8335","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4121008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Irons","original_name":"Jack Irons","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":"/e57vASpj5yh8aj4yuof5bPPpjRm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67de01931fee87c1bc7a8c48","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4365806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Sharp","original_name":"Duncan Sharp","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67de0385d68104527969aeb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32235,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shane F.
