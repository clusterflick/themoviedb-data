Arthur hopes to find blueprints and maps drawn up by Tihonovetsky on how to make his way into space, floating down the river. In the place of the former manor there is an abandoned house of culture and a monument to the muscular proletarian pointing to the sky. Arthur finds the oldest man in the village, capable of at least something to tell. From him, he learns a story about a treasure, which has long been shared.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/VJ3khtQp0bvDQ3xXnkTUN19est.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2018-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Nice Good Brass Band","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nash milyy, khoroshy dukhovoy orkestr","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Isachenkov","original_name":"Arthur Isachenkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5bf80b120e0a264cfc01444b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandr Moroz","original_name":"Alexandr Moroz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5bf80b809251417c1d07f0c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Petrochenko","original_name":"Mikhail Petrochenko","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5bf80bb80e0a26265e0fcded","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2163124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Prusak","original_name":"Olga Prusak","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3VrGOk8xymyGisqsnLoYTo0qsQv.jpg","credit_id":"5bd57d720e0a2622c8029a29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2163124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Prusak","original_name":"Olga Prusak","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3VrGOk8xymyGisqsnLoYTo0qsQv.jpg","credit_id":"5bd57dcb92514103960273af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2163132,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Evgeny Vrublevsky","original_name":"Evgeny Vrublevsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd57ef20e0a2622d102bb35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2163132,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Evgeny Vrublevsky","original_name":"Evgeny Vrublevsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd57efd0e0a2622bf029889","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2163132,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Evgeny Vrublevsky","original_name":"Evgeny Vrublevsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf8081d9251417c1d07ebd2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dTCrVtF7QRcDoH4AQuPSd26esFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/VJ3khtQp0bvDQ3xXnkTUN19est.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2018-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
