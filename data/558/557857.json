When the re-emergence of old friends and the mounting pressures of family obligations impinge upon their daily lives, they soon discover that loneliness is not synonymous with isolation, and that true abandonment comes in many forms. Directed by Jay McRoy (Acts of Contrition, 2009), Abandon explores the relationship between human memory and personal history. In the process, Abandon reveals that the “stubbornly persistent illusions” which Albert Einstein once posited as separating “the past, present, and future” are far more precarious and easily shattered than we would care to imagine.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abandon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2164855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay McRoy","original_name":"Jay McRoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd89f770e0a262c9a00ffb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Released worldwide through Vimeo in 2012","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
