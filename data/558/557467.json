This question is now getting serious attention from scientists who study animal senses. Humans rely on smell, sight, taste, touch and sound; other animals have super-powered versions of these senses, and a few have extra senses we don't have at all. From a dog that seems to use smell to tell time to a dolphin that can \"see\" with its ears, discover how animals use their senses in ways we humans can barely imagine. But it's not just the senses that are remarkable -- it's the brains that process them. NOVA goes into the minds of animals to \"see\" the world in an entirely new way.","popularity":0.253,"poster_path":"/lvVYAMpScBQeseTVi6THyup5JqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Animal Minds","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Lewman","original_name":"Lance Lewman","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/bFU3Blay4gA8UvAQCJFWCBuvhW6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5bd642b10e0a2622cc037e7f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Barrett","original_name":"Matt Barrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd6427dc3a368210003e83d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3531184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lvVYAMpScBQeseTVi6THyup5JqX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q3w1B37NTMxjK0OU5lzFD3N9u72.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1265}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15162,"name":"dog"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
