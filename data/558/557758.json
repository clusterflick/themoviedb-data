This imaginative, experimental work investigates the growing feminization of the global economy and its impact on Mexican women living and working in the area. Looking at the border as both a discursive and material space, the video explores the sexualization of the border region through labor division, prostitution, the expression of female desires in the entertainment industry, and sexual violence in the public sphere.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/6PHxftA9Wh8GheRpISIWcXxKY05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Performing the Border","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1837914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ursula Biemann","original_name":"Ursula Biemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd805919251417f6e005bf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1837914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ursula Biemann","original_name":"Ursula Biemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd8059b9251417f5a005f9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6744378","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PHxftA9Wh8GheRpISIWcXxKY05.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive","release_date":"2000-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
