The journey leads from South Sudan and Ethiopia to Malay sea nomads and Brazilian Indians in Mato Grosso, who have started to defend themselves against the destruction of their natural habitat.\r The result is a film that captures intimate and unadulterated encounters with sumptuous photography – while also serving as an appeal for the preservation of indigenous cultures, which will surely perish unless we rethink and act accordingly.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/78LocRPoBfZXpBaHndh6IB01z3E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmtank","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey to the last indigenous people on earth - visually stunning, touching and thoughtful.","title":"At the Fringes of the World","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Tielsch","original_name":"Thomas Tielsch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd8651b9251417f6e00ac49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2164700,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Markus Mauthe","original_name":"Markus Mauthe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd8657ec3a368214200d004","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Tielsch","original_name":"Thomas Tielsch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd8650f9251417f6e00ac41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9266172","wikidata_id":"Q56756092","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2544,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/78LocRPoBfZXpBaHndh6IB01z3E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1797}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
