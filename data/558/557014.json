One day he has (at least that is what he thinks!) a bright idea : he asks Sonia, his cousin living in Poland but staying in Paris at the moment, to seduce Hubert. In these conditions, how could Lucienne not fall into his arms again? Unfortunately for Archibald, things do not go (at all!) according to plan : he himself falls for Sonia while Hubert manages to reconquer Lucienne! Dispirited, Sonia decides to return to Warsaw.","popularity":0.3193,"poster_path":"/d1WwrRDIp7R2xtB4d1sw1trq9hK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1931-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Cousin From Warsaw","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvira Popescu","original_name":"Elvira Popescu","popularity":0.1611,"profile_path":"/797mN0xnRLduGxnZC3AFBJUTM82.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sonia Varilovna","credit_id":"5c6c6d64c3a3686fb6de7bbc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Roanne","original_name":"André Roanne","popularity":0.1494,"profile_path":"/pi78rbeZIL7QaRmO3Y2uIOPJWQQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hubert","credit_id":"5c6c6d75925141250a0df6b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Lambert","original_name":"Madeleine Lambert","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lucienne","credit_id":"5c6c6d85c3a368745eeb6930","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustave Gallet","original_name":"Gustave Gallet","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Archibald Burel","credit_id":"5c6c6d960e0a261aaf9e0ba2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29548,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Curt Courant","original_name":"Curt Courant","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f8b991dcf875008acb7b3f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Gallone","original_name":"Carmine Gallone","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/xBzyQuhLtL7YDg2V4TQhcKWQqQO.jpg","credit_id":"5bd3fbd30e0a2622d10108d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henri-Georges Clouzot","original_name":"Henri-Georges Clouzot","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/lKljbdReVkqhwTsjBcuqt1Uwiiq.jpg","credit_id":"5c6c6e30c3a3684f97e9ff57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0454887","wikidata_id":"Q3273495","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":2213,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d1WwrRDIp7R2xtB4d1sw1trq9hK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1616}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
