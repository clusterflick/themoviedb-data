A mythological microcosm and science's answer to the Tower of Babel, with its many thousand employees as an indispensable element among cables and computers. The researchers speak the same esoteric and nerdy language. But their physical trials are not the only experiments in the human anthill. CERN is also a utopian experiment in collaboration across cultures, where the world's most advanced technology meets the world's sharpest—and some of the quirkiest—minds.","popularity":0.4404,"poster_path":"/mh3ARFUSJdrwMUf2QKILFw5eTp1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2163884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna de Manincor","original_name":"Anna de Manincor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd6e720c3a368211203ab45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271854,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roberto Beani","original_name":"Roberto Beani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c967fa09251416b41f36b67","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925981,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Massimo Carozzi","original_name":"Massimo Carozzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c967f8e0e0a264ccebeda2f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8283556","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPCGhOdjlRuq7HiWmDWkl9Q9puh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mh3ARFUSJdrwMUf2QKILFw5eTp1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1985}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6012,"name":"physics"},{"id":6282,"name":"workplace"},{"id":10124,"name":"laboratory"},{"id":234169,"name":"cern"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nyon Film Festival","release_date":"2018-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
