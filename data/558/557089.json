It is a tale of passion and fear, set against a backdrop of revolution and violence. The film is what most people remember, but the story of the writing of the book has more twists, intrigue and bravery than many a Hollywood blockbuster. In this documentary, Stephen Smith traces the revolutionary beginnings of this bestseller, to it becoming a pawn of the CIA at the height of the Cold War.","popularity":0.4313,"poster_path":"/yLQ99nEUm7fgXM1LVJc2fM9nI9n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Doctor Zhivago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Smith","original_name":"Stephen Smith","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/gipaPABt8s8vXGaG0n2TZ6qtpRK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5bd471cd92514103a0016899","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Cathro","original_name":"George Cathro","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd471f50e0a2622c8017a4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kristy Jane Breetzke","original_name":"Kristy Jane Breetzke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd4720a0e0a2622cc016e40","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul McCaffery","original_name":"Paul McCaffery","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd47237c3a368210e01334d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Cathro","original_name":"George Cathro","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd472589251410387015d04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7609514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yLQ99nEUm7fgXM1LVJc2fM9nI9n.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a2je2WiwSk1Ryj4Fd3itFlMKrfA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10703,"name":"tragic love"},{"id":41278,"name":"russian politics"},{"id":158620,"name":"russian revolution (1917)"},{"id":220470,"name":"broken romances"},{"id":233147,"name":"russian literature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
