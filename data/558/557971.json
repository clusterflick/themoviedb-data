JUNE BRIDE: REDEMPTION OF A YAKUZA is a feature-length documentary about Tatsuya Shindo, a former mobster turned preacher, who seeks forgiveness for a life's worth of disappointment and crime in his makeshift church - June Bride - at one time a smoke-filled bar. Hanging on Shindo's every word is his loyal congregation, an eclectic mix of tattooed ex-convicts and wayward souls who want to start over. Through his journey from the criminal underworld to a mission from God, Shindo declares, \"Loyalty to my yakuza boss is the same as the one to God.\" But will his faith cost him more than just his finger?","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/9OpKdIocSvYkajZRiRd7aXCZTcO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Criminally Inspirational Story","title":"June Bride: Redemption of a Yakuza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuya Shindo","original_name":"Tatsuya Shindo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bd9340f925141155f006c95","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135812,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Derek Shimoda","original_name":"Derek Shimoda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd93436c3a3683ce3006512","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rintaro Sawamoto","original_name":"Rintaro Sawamoto","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":"/8WNiVrCSYmHjgJUoSI9YO82tzaY.jpg","credit_id":"67d850fc6457803689f14ca0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3815388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9OpKdIocSvYkajZRiRd7aXCZTcO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":694},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vylK8xOOsgEgLo79c5J65ZcsCR3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
