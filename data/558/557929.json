He has always found pride and joy in the company of his wife, son and daughter. He suddenly finds himself enthralled by the advances of a gay young woman siren, who lives in the same apartment house as he does. So marked an influence does she have over him as time progresses that at last he quite forgets his home ties, neglects his family, and goes the way of many other men who have forgotten the meaning of paternity and blood ties. The story is advanced through many scenes enacted with the accompanying notes of New York's night life, and the denouement comes when the faithful wife discovers her husband's infidelity. At this time the mother's mind nearly loses balance, while Jane, the beautiful daughter, crazed by the grief of her mother, determines to take part in the tragedy. With revolver in hand she steals up to the apartment of the woman, but her frail nature is overcome by the temperamental anger of the woman and her mission fails.","popularity":0.8986,"poster_path":"/kArZ9z1cPKwrfF3Vtz4rcCkZWxZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of the Sexes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Single Standard","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Crisp","original_name":"Donald Crisp","popularity":0.2368,"profile_path":"/MEPq09iLEwJVrxw1T97qOILhk6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frank Andrews","credit_id":"5c6a039dc3a3684fabe48b3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jane Andrews, the daughter","credit_id":"5c6a03cf0e0a266daca4fefa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Andrews, the son","credit_id":"5c6a03fdc3a368745ee5982a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Alden","original_name":"Mary Alden","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/q17Y3cJppoRVSiAo5RHafRj2DuO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Frank Andrews","credit_id":"5c6a042f9251417aa205b9e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cleo's lover","credit_id":"5c6a04590e0a261aaf985562","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay Tincher","original_name":"Fay Tincher","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/nxXKXXvJWo9aMV8Q6U6DfF9IATv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cleo","credit_id":"5c6a0474c3a368745ee59957","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.E.
