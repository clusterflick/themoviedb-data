The film is characterized by a twisted plot and alternating main suspects until, at the end of the film, the viewers are presented with a strikingly different version of the story.

time.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/akppuRnxJdOaZGRkUN2ypIeasiD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Munis
