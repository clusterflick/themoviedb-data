Fred has fallen for Annette, a comely cabaret bartender. He proposes to her, much to the horror of his family, which considers Annette and her unsophisticated father far below their caste. The family convinces Fred to give up the girl in exchange for increased position and income in the company. But Fred's lapse is momentary, and he again pursues Annette. But she, by this time, has learned of his erstwhile agreement and has agreed to marry someone else.","popularity":0.2011,"poster_path":"/w4gWev38WNUDep2tQW5E3YN6vOb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1931-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Highness Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Tréville","original_name":"Roger Tréville","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/fDli2Li2BfvI7AxrOJmrMylUMr9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fred Leroy","credit_id":"613f1386149565008e982b58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annabella","original_name":"Annabella","popularity":1.2405,"profile_path":"/gsuec04s5ymZrvvzCSWkxngl7pF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Annette Weber","credit_id":"613f139f006b010063eb3e78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Laure","original_name":"Marie-Laure","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"la grand-mère","credit_id":"613f13cae27260002a9c27c8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Péguy","original_name":"Robert Péguy","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd52a50c3a368211202169f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Schmidt","original_name":"Erich Schmidt","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd52a5a925141038d023b81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe May","original_name":"Joe May","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":"/ei4gbYU3KepGJo3kv200TYGhtOZ.jpg","credit_id":"5bd52a640e0a2622cc024bee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191479","wikidata_id":"Q3490009","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w4gWev38WNUDep2tQW5E3YN6vOb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
