Hartford seems to have had a low-profile and low-budget jazz department, and the same goes for this film, which clocks in at just over half an hour, and barely scratches the surface of the subject matter. Still, what is here is engaging and a surprisingly candid portrait. McLean is shown practicing in his apartment and - briefly - playing with his quintet, but most of the running time is spent at Hartford in the classroom - and what classes they must have been. McLean's stream-of-consciousness lectures run from Sun Ra to JFK's assassination to how he learned Giant Steps, and the students try their best to keep up. A fascinating glimpse into the mind of a jazz musician.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3fbujTl0a5vFRflPW8AJ5e1WaFb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jackie McLean on Mars","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie McLean","original_name":"Jackie McLean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f193406a6d931003785d97e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Woody Shaw","original_name":"Woody Shaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f193616519bbb0035701122","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Levis","original_name":"Kenneth Levis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f193508db952d0034985223","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Levis","original_name":"Kenneth Levis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f193539447f9c00343641ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Levis","original_name":"Kenneth Levis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f193555a6d931003785e05e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0189618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3fbujTl0a5vFRflPW8AJ5e1WaFb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
