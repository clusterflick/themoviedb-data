The little they earn goes into drugs and slot machines. She was raised in Los Angeles and he spent his life in gangs, which left him with a bullet wound in the head that sometimes affects his memory. But all the wounds, the drugs and the gambling cannot help them forget that at one time they were a real family with a child they loved tenderly, until the day the Tijuana authorities took her away. Time goes by and Weraâ€™s love for Topo becomes nothing but a bitter memory that accompanies her in her descent to hell.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/g2rdvDbOvEQDywwmJPg9PcBuO4x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topo y Wera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Charles Hue","original_name":"Jean-Charles Hue","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c046e109251417e2e0669b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g2rdvDbOvEQDywwmJPg9PcBuO4x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
