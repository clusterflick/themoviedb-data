When little Darla is selected to choose the winning ticket, she draws her father's number. The crowd reacts angrily, thinking that the drawing is a fraud, forcing the child to choose another number. This one turns out to be her own ticket, after which a third drawing yields her mother's ticket. While pandemonium erupts in the audience, some gangsters arrive and raid the theater. A chase follows, resulting in the eventual capture of the crooks.","popularity":0.7668,"poster_path":"/pVncICAXmZ1HMDzmTN7HOWwMacZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neighborhood House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Charley Chase","credit_id":"5c24541a0e0a26309af1cd84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosina Lawrence","original_name":"Rosina Lawrence","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/vJZMJdGNZWRA0zJw9KIp2KXVis3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rosina Chase","credit_id":"61d4c3ae12197e0065814a50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darla Hood","original_name":"Darla Hood","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/nXqxSjQig8asRbeoqD9CCAC4k5u.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Chase","credit_id":"61d4c3ba52dc7f006b0267f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Meeker","original_name":"George Meeker","popularity":0.3186,"profile_path":"/AoJtJAJGAdCYGnPiCxipob9skxE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Adolph, Theatre Manager","credit_id":"61d4c3c71b722c00413119a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Taggart","original_name":"Ben Taggart","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/541DUYjjgla2ihxPa9aSRTr1CJb.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Cop","credit_id":"61d4c3d2e10f46008e73d4c5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Elliott","original_name":"Dick Elliott","popularity":0.4177,"profile_path":"/4v08cvtoM8hjpZh2s9uIJZh75WD.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Perkins - Charley's Boss","credit_id":"61d4c3dfbb26020085096b78","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Bowen","original_name":"Harry Bowen","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zKALgIQV6JTdRCkFEkGR42f3HkY.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Irate Movie Patron","credit_id":"61d4c3ed66a7c30069d9ebcf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bess Flowers","original_name":"Bess Flowers","popularity":0.4188,"profile_path":"/oErbIo6a2QPYZSqfdzU6vlDTD8i.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Irate Moviegoer (uncredited)","credit_id":"629a3b7b1e9225006424a6e2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"(uncredited)","credit_id":"629a3b8e7ad08c00662ca91c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34171,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Flournoy","original_name":"Richard Flournoy","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d4c396a84ff70041ffb018","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","credit_id":"61d4c37fbfeb8b0066bebe08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Law","original_name":"Harold Law","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d4c38a52dc7f00a4f708f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Law","original_name":"Harold Law","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d4c38566a7c30042ada382","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur V.
