At the same time as these images, some characters dialogue. A couple and a young girl - their daughter? - who remains mute. A dialogue of a great platitude where it is literally question of the rain and the good weather. We then realize that the mute daughter is staging - on the beach - the mother who refuses her desire and the father who makes it impossible. At the end of the film, we see the \"parents\" at the water's edge leaving the girl alone again.","popularity":0.1021,"poster_path":"/vkURE86vG7AaqPpQi6YWitT2hCP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S'il vous plaît... la mer?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Presle","original_name":"Micheline Presle","popularity":0.2774,"profile_path":"/l3JEGPsntAwicRgZaNelmVoYGmg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6457bf57156cc7013ff0c369","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2206442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maud Rimbaud","original_name":"Maud Rimbaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6457bf5e156cc7011eff3f2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Marié","original_name":"François Marié","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6457bf6afe077a01398c0593","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Loublier","original_name":"Jean-Paul Loublier","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/khaQ2qLDgYWXfaHMmZFc1QDvl10.jpg","credit_id":"62adc1dd0d9f5a00630e6003","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1768296,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maurice Giraud","original_name":"Maurice Giraud","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc1d055c1f40051911bac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847169,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Brotons","original_name":"Anne Brotons","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc1d5944a5703e4f6b13e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martine Lancelot","original_name":"Martine Lancelot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c04a19592514113290b7213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234643","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vkURE86vG7AaqPpQi6YWitT2hCP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
