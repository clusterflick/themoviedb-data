A man walks toward the shore, looking for something. A bunch of illegal immigrants from northern Africa are hiding in the bushes. The man works for the local mobster exploiting the immigrants. They will work at a local mine as modern slaves. Among them is somebody who is not supposed to be there. Sometimes inner conflicts come to the surface. This is the moment to take a look where nobody does, where modern hypocrisy turns other humans into misfits, and not only people from the third world.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Next Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomaso Mannoni","original_name":"Tomaso Mannoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c03e883c3a36869ae0b1f58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Terre di Confine Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"EuroAsia Shorts","release_date":"2016-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
