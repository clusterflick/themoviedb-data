What makes this little film fascinating is it was one of the earliest color broadcasts on television and happily is one of the few early color productions for TV that can be seen in color now. Early color television productions seem to have had a limited color capability much like the early 1930's attempts at Technicolor. This actually adds to the charm of this little Christmas story giving in an \"old time\" feel.","popularity":0.3145,"poster_path":"/nyFXuyTE5KS8YnDxV1dLgCnjhIS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Park Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A String of Blue Beads","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Jourdan","original_name":"Louis Jourdan","popularity":0.5524,"profile_path":"/pHLHxUSvj1usU8jVAADGKDO5PZ7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Antique Shop Owner","credit_id":"5c070aa4c3a368647610e17d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen-Cobb Hill","original_name":"Ellen-Cobb Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marilyn","credit_id":"5c070acd9251417e55094668","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Hamilton","original_name":"Margaret Hamilton","popularity":0.4937,"profile_path":"/e2tJi7ziy5HCNO6pnpAXoxhnlfg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Loomis","credit_id":"5c070afb9251417e2e09674a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Lynn","original_name":"Elaine Lynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Barbara May","credit_id":"5c070b2b0e0a26360e0f294c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Lynn","original_name":"Christine Lynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Barbara's Sister","credit_id":"5c070b3c9251410b920e3a21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Michael","original_name":"Mary Michael","popularity":0.2013,"profile_path":"/8cB5d8t41G7wQRMK3rrUSyAiFJw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Anderson","credit_id":"5c070bbe92514111160d5286","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Orrick McDearmon","original_name":"David Orrick McDearmon","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Stark","credit_id":"5c070bce9251417e55094747","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Dinehart","original_name":"Alan Dinehart","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/61xlajAGLWffJOBasrKXgB0E6g2.jpg","credit_id":"5c070a76c3a3685a4b0e572d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Greendale","original_name":"Alexander Greendale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c070c0fc3a3685c370e5f85","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83906,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fulton Oursler","original_name":"Fulton Oursler","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c070c010e0a265b280fb5ce","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96276,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Don Malkames","original_name":"Don Malkames","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db43188d40d4c0012f9f47e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1308161","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nyFXuyTE5KS8YnDxV1dLgCnjhIS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2005-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1953-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
