Their story becomes a fascinating case study of Vancouver power relations: how police corruption, racism, homophobia, and a covert \"whites-only\" immigration policy, conspired to maintain the status quo of this colonial port city. Told in four parts, by three separate directors, the film is a hybrid of film forms including drama, documentary and musical.","popularity":0.0953,"poster_path":"/nidolWaOorQ5Tt4AXhKe5a7ptHM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rex vs. Singh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Greyson","original_name":"John Greyson","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/eFxjwKtUOjRE6lKPIfD7ggZVk7K.jpg","credit_id":"5c0468900e0a26486a07f03c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"5d1d0b0694d8a831163ca3bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1302855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Fung","original_name":"Richard Fung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6sVJR9nb4rE9tISZH32USSprk9i.jpg","credit_id":"5d1d0ac74da3d4001228c626","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1323538","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nidolWaOorQ5Tt4AXhKe5a7ptHM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
