Its original title remains unknown—the year of its initial release was probably 1917. “Susie,” the recurring heroine of the series (played by Leatrice Joy) is the wife in question; fed up being married to an impecunious writer, she leaves him a note (“As a writer you are a flivver [jalopy]. I'm off to get a six cylinder start”) and flees to the city. Her husband secretly follows her, enduring a great deal of symbolic punishment along the way.","popularity":0.1315,"poster_path":"/zXM0umTmyzVUlHiKkhn3mM5EykM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Neglected Wife","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Susie","credit_id":"5c06e2b6c3a3685c370e297e","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1005,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zXM0umTmyzVUlHiKkhn3mM5EykM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1917-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
