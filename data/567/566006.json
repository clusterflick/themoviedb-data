These were not happy years for me and they are not happy films. They were all conceived as silent films and I was very consciously working out my ideas about visual rhythm and visual/musical form. When I had them transferred to digital I had the opportunity to see how they would work as sound films - How hard would it be to compose musical tracks for them that would complement their spirit without detracting from their purity as silent film compositions? I had lots of fun in the process and have learned a great deal from them about the interaction between the two modalities as kinds of musical expression. I will leave it to others to decide if they are successful or not.\" -DB","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zqo3bugyk6EKNThsseED3klxFIj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead End, Dead End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Barnett","original_name":"Dan Barnett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02dbce0e0a2633a609b46c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9437286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zqo3bugyk6EKNThsseED3klxFIj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iNnz0nhcNFxgLYkpIlIanXh3vja.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
