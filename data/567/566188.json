Isaac and his faithful wife, Rachel, deplore that in America their children are forced to work on the Jewish Sabbath. Leah and Sam are not so strict as their parents and the old customs pall about their more American spirits. Sam is employed in a cloak house and secretly loves his employer's daughter, but she refuses to recognize him. Leah is loved by the handsome gentile floorwalker, and despite her father's objections, she marries him. Isaac orders Leah from the house. Later, the daughter of the cloak manufacturer marries an admirer and Sam is invited to the wedding. He drinks and disgraces himself, and returning home, is turned out by the heartbroken rabbi. He leaves, telling the old man that he will return when the father celebrated the Christian Christmas.","popularity":0.1075,"poster_path":"/fESyVwbQ73otAxKXjFbTFNEAs3z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21844,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rex Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jew's Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillips Smalley","original_name":"Phillips Smalley","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/wqmmEk0TPELGnDgVOSXGM8YYzJ2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Isaac - the Rabbi","credit_id":"5d5c2c50f29d66001518d4a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lois Weber","original_name":"Lois Weber","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c6YcUHNxlP9Fo5cxbJJQi3xAdGF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leah - Isaac's Daughter","credit_id":"5d5c2c538d22fc001718abb2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lule Warrenton","original_name":"Lule Warrenton","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/cKT15bHW6ysYEHryH2gqrhRWbRW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rachel - Isaac's Wife","credit_id":"5d5c2c59f29d66001318d68c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Hall","original_name":"Ella Hall","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/67A99kOrIVe7CaP7JqxmfWi7qFj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eleanor - Isaac's Granddaughter","credit_id":"5d5c2c5f8d22fc001818ab3c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lois Weber","original_name":"Lois Weber","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c6YcUHNxlP9Fo5cxbJJQi3xAdGF.jpg","credit_id":"5c040010c3a3685a4b0ac89e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillips Smalley","original_name":"Phillips Smalley","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/wqmmEk0TPELGnDgVOSXGM8YYzJ2.jpg","credit_id":"5c04001e92514116540b4d02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lois Weber","original_name":"Lois Weber","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c6YcUHNxlP9Fo5cxbJJQi3xAdGF.jpg","credit_id":"5d5c2c688d22fc001818ab4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003028","wikidata_id":"Q104470063","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zIbrQC5vCvIJbmN65zljBO7tzRD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fESyVwbQ73otAxKXjFbTFNEAs3z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
