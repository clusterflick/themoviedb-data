This work is a correspondence of two information fragments of different origins and times that met by accident. Cinema transforms into a three-dimensional landscape--utilizing data that is based on an archaeological misinterpretation. Zuse Strip is named after Konrad Zuse’s first digital computer. It used discarded 35mm movie film from the German UFA as a medium to read and write 8-bit binary code data with a hole-punch system. The work was inspired by Lev Manovich's text “Cinema by Numbers”, as well as “The Deciphering of Linear B\" by linguist/archaeologist John Chadwick.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/xDiACRZfiX0mILWc0NDttVNGPx9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zuse Strip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caspar Stracke","original_name":"Caspar Stracke","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c05851e0e0a265b280dbe12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28707305","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.619,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xDiACRZfiX0mILWc0NDttVNGPx9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":928}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
