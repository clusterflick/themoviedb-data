Their anger peaks after watching renowned writer Toussaint's overt machismo and commercial pandering during a televised book launch. In a bold move against his phallocratic image, they kidnap him, expecting to expose his true nature. However, as events unfold, Toussaint gradually reveals a sensitive, conflicted side that challenges his public persona. Humor and satire drive this escapade, critiquing traditional gender roles and societal expectations.","popularity":0.3374,"poster_path":"/eD9mOrZ0CScKwp12ExOnOqTXuVv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du
