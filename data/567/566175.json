A former actress living in a beautiful, spacious home, Billie shuffles around her indoor pool and feeds her dog. But she's lonely for affection. Enter Golden Love, an over 50 dating site where she gets a message from a man named Michael3490 and quickly begins imagining a new life. Brennan's film offers a delightful mix of the melancholic and the dreamy, highlighting the vulnerability of non-tech-savvy users in our digital age, while also charming us with Billie's innocence and hopefulness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9370426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
