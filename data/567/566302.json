The first video assist rule is that the image one sees in it has to be more interesting than what one sees outside. Nothing is left to chance. It helps to preview the shot, organise space, arrange the scenes, move the actors and light the set. And it provides it all with a meaning depending on how the camera is used. It is the space-time before the shot, where it is sketched.","popularity":0.2198,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anteroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luís Miguel Cintra","original_name":"Luís Miguel Cintra","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/cdFwM3XffJAarnt355yWCxMvEnH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e12d2fa8741c400143dbc7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catarina Ruivo","original_name":"Catarina Ruivo","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e12d30dd64ac2001865eb7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Batarda","original_name":"Beatriz Batarda","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/gDlPG1CivHUuSpFI9rSy3p33Ogo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e12d314fc5f06001590b8bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112003,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Acácio de Almeida","original_name":"Acácio de Almeida","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/yB1mU5Sj7CYKOtXTstMQ8MwWMx8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e12d31d8741c400143dbc8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcello Urgeghe","original_name":"Marcello Urgeghe","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/qg8Nw0hGDA0ccuIxwyP4mZNyf3Y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e12d3269020120018b76a80","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Nunes","original_name":"Miguel Nunes","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/sKGvhpt2P2O9XjriVYWUFk3vjFF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e12d32f9020120015b7100b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Cramez","original_name":"Jorge Cramez","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/kkIjtDkhqrWiEZJPeYVGiyqIGZ7.jpg","credit_id":"5c046c750e0a262cfb0b3528","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9427430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
