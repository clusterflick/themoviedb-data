Whatever potential there is for heightened drama – the suicide of a husband, a cult massacre, abandoned children – it is diffused by the familiar rhythms of everydayness. This attention to the everyday must be understood within the context of death, which plays a significant role in all of Koreeda’s films. It is death that deepens our sense of life and makes even the most mundane moment seem profound.","popularity":0.1652,"poster_path":"/qnRFlhlWOv4tToS7EQlD0YqhqlS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World According to Koreeda Hirokazu","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Richter","original_name":"Max Richter","popularity":0.3414,"profile_path":"/keYPSx2YlyRCk8KY7YaZ81fZ1Y3.jpg","credit_id":"61265060944a57002cd0fd16","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kogonada","original_name":"Kogonada","popularity":0.3211,"profile_path":"/4CgKbtqDRPr7tCCWqjXeikZXTFi.jpg","credit_id":"5c055f1b0e0a2636ce0d606f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kogonada","original_name":"Kogonada","popularity":0.3211,"profile_path":"/4CgKbtqDRPr7tCCWqjXeikZXTFi.jpg","credit_id":"5c055f120e0a265b280d85e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7958222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bYyOvnIm3gwI8qyPbnmFvMaFAU1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a65MxL8z5nGykRsggrLOP6gNaDj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnRFlhlWOv4tToS7EQlD0YqhqlS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ysTY96iJi9gfFhUd1qlaqfkHlfm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The world according to Koreeda","key":"Hu5YAuZ0Nyc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-10-26T15:35:39.000Z","id":"612650e6d7059400957d2ce7"}]}}}
