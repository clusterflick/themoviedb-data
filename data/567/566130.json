But the director was disappointed by the encounter with the woman who had been her great role model. Instead, she set out to discover what life means to Egyptian women by visiting her female relatives. Her mother, aunts, and neighbors talk about life as a married woman, about the traditional clitoridectomy of girls, about love and sexuality. The result is a very impressive and extremely personal film.","popularity":0.273,"poster_path":"/5Uc65YYPPL2wCzoeEMI173UpqWa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hidden Faces","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nawal al Saadawi","original_name":"Nawal al Saadawi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c03ad590e0a2633a60ac5f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Safaa Fathy","original_name":"Safaa Fathy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c03ad67c3a36869ae0ad54e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Hunt","original_name":"Claire Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd318999251412236272e6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Longinotto","original_name":"Kim Longinotto","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/u5tB6AkfkgZ3nk3EBtWPlp0WigN.jpg","credit_id":"5cd318a6c3a36840cfe07470","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2152640","wikidata_id":"Q123289082","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Uc65YYPPL2wCzoeEMI173UpqWa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11718,"name":"feminist"},{"id":158651,"name":"realism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
