This (very hot) summer Engel can't bear it any longer and she goes to a doctor, but even he can't think of a cure. He asks the help of a scientist who is familiar with her disease (Plato's syndrome), but the scientist only sees her as a freak. Meanwhile the doctor has become very interested in Engel.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoenzucht","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
