Others insist on cleaning and tidying rooms that will be gone the next day. Collapse and resistance coexist. In A punto de despegar we witness the disappearance of San Agustín, the last town that survived the era of the great haciendas of Lima. The expansion of the airport causes the eviction of the entire place and with its demolition comes the end of several traditions and ways of life. Modern Peru is a one-way train where the archaic has no place. A respectful camera preserves the faces, gestures and words of those last days. A film built after a decade of friendship with the neighbors. A farewell that radiates affection, intimacy and uneasiness in equal measure.","popularity":0.0895,"poster_path":"/Aq2rRSMmHsnGwrL1TZuQ8UYCH8J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2015-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A punto de despegar","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robinson Díaz Sifuentes","original_name":"Robinson Díaz Sifuentes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02d6d4c3a36869ae09b842","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorena Best Urday","original_name":"Lorena Best Urday","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02d726c3a3685c37095a7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9627600","wikidata_id":"Q110965340","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aq2rRSMmHsnGwrL1TZuQ8UYCH8J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
