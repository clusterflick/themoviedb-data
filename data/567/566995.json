She's finishing getting ready, so she introduces him to her dog, which loves to fetch a small red rubber ball with blue stars. He tosses the ball to the dog a few times, somewhat distractedly, looks through a book (\"Do I have to be me?\") on her coffee table, opens the French doors to her balcony, sits down and continues to toss the ball. It takes a deadly carom, but when she emerges from her bedroom ready to go, he stays mum. Outside the building, a crowd has gathered. Will he tell her what happened, or leave it for her to put together? Is there any way out for him?","popularity":0.464,"poster_path":"/5fpDembjDS9bqfdgdxlzxW6s6X2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1998-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fetch","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Day","original_name":"Matt Day","popularity":0.4524,"profile_path":"/2elQ6hUC5cSlw5yzJE1tHEXhKAh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dff8b019824c80013e22b39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":240289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Frith","original_name":"Rebecca Frith","popularity":0.1427,"profile_path":"/uVzsQj994ZVAqMpFWWY10qJDQEs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dff8b0ad236e600128eef30","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin McGrath","original_name":"Martin McGrath","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce7d017b5ef04e6b3c564","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508759,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Heidi Kenessey","original_name":"Heidi Kenessey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce7de12aabc0e4225d91d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan MacKinnon","original_name":"Susan MacKinnon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce7eb63d9370092b9d38a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn-Maree Danzey","original_name":"Lynn-Maree Danzey","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dff8b1bd236e600108efe35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Judi McCrossin","original_name":"Judi McCrossin","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dff8b2726dac1001462f8df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0157632","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":897,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5fpDembjDS9bqfdgdxlzxW6s6X2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":598}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"1998-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
