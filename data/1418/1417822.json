It shows how the once powerful anglophone community is now questioning its very survival. It discusses some of the motivating forces behind Québécois nationalism. The film concludes by asking if the Canadian nation can survive if neither of its major language groups is welcome in the territory of the other.","popularity":0.1803,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under New Management","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":242414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Massey","original_name":"Walter Massey","popularity":0.2877,"profile_path":"/m21hh2nlcEfnhXuKLMbgMMjN0ft.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"678741648d49c44fa5bb0a91","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Viljoen","original_name":"Tina Viljoen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6787414bbd793c03544f1ac3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458729,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Symansky","original_name":"Adam Symansky","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678741cfbd793c03544f1bdd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Viljoen","original_name":"Tina Viljoen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678741d884160ff0a47af0c2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie Howells","original_name":"Barrie Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wl9j33wHjYwssXlzwnlDwjyFBRX.jpg","credit_id":"678741e6601acfe7bd4f9c36","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boyce Richardson","original_name":"Boyce Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678741f2601acfe7bd4f9c47","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Knight","original_name":"John Knight","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678742048d49c44fa5bb0b30","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0224321","wikidata_id":"Q123287571","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":336216,"name":"québec"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
