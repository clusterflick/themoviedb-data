Keenan and his extended Jiu Jitsu family for a foundational introduction to the art of Jiu Jitsu.  Filmed at his Verde Valley BJJ academy in Cottonwood, AZ, this seminar offers insights into the preparation before the plunge. Keenan and his team discuss the development of stabilizing muscles and myelin connections that will help you bridge the seemingly un-traversable gap between where you are now and where you could be if you choose to embrace and immerse yourself in this incredible confidence-building, puzzle-solving martial art.  Hopefully this film will assist in making that first step less daunting.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/e6LGF2n1nHIw74OB9b6Exn5zb5q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Introduction to Jiu Jitsu","title":"The Great In Between","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e6LGF2n1nHIw74OB9b6Exn5zb5q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
