Kirchin scored many classic films in the 1960s including Primitive London, The Shuttered Room, I Start Counting, Negatives and The Abominable Dr Phibes. His subsequent two albums, Worlds Within Worlds are now highly sought-after cult classics; his work was cited by Brian Eno as having discovered “a whole new area of sound”.  Mind On The Run features interviews with those who knew and loved him, including Jonny Trunk, label boss Warren De Wolfe, music writers Richard Williams and Bob Stanley, pioneering improviser Evan Parker, saxophonist Alan Barnes, Sean O’Hagan of the High Llamas and many more as well as previously unheard commentary and music by Basil himself, together with newly discovered photos from Basil’s personal archive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mind on the Run: The Basil Kirchin Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Stephenson","original_name":"Matt Stephenson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abadd1e09d6c9190b082c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Jones","original_name":"Alan Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abadfb47051c54beb0c5c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28717376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
