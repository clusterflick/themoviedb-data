With a recurring motif of the doppelganger, inspired by Dostoevsky, and themes of Sartrean existentialism, the film presents a raw and unflinching look at the ambiguity of an authentic existence. A slick and evocative style of black and white cinematography is employed to further this, leaving the audience in a state of questioning, and catharsis based on Rafael's drive through his circumstance of skulduggery.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4T9vEF2qhdHekHhc3IZD0lQgMdq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Truth Blurs...","title":"ANTIDOTAL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Phoenix","original_name":"Ethan Phoenix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rafael","credit_id":"6787004794fc87ef487b7e67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siena Cox","original_name":"Siena Cox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Girlfriend","credit_id":"67870053136e157cf27baf13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Williams","original_name":"Olivia Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6787005ff38b5d3338baf613","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Phoenix","original_name":"Ethan Phoenix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6787007b94fc87ef487b7f45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Phoenix","original_name":"Ethan Phoenix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6787009994fc87ef487b7f52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Phoenix","original_name":"Ethan Phoenix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678700a5b50c71db5c4e5554","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Phoenix","original_name":"Ethan Phoenix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678700b494fc87ef487b7f66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179970,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ignacio Nordenstahl","original_name":"Ignacio Nordenstahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678700d0601acfe7bd4f9602","department":"Crew","job":"Transportation Captain"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179971,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zohayr Altaf","original_name":"Zohayr Altaf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678700f08d49c44fa5bb03c8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35397497","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4T9vEF2qhdHekHhc3IZD0lQgMdq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
