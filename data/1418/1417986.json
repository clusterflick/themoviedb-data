They know firsthand the struggles and vulnerabilities of addiction, as well as the challenges of reintegrating after treatment. For many addicts, returning to neighborhoods plagued by drugs and abandoned houses that serve as drug dens makes relapse almost inevitable. Through their nonprofit, Gemini Reliance, the Rollins brothers purchase dilapidated homes and transform them into safe, sober living spaces for those in recovery. Their efforts have proven effective, yet sobriety remains a constant battle.  The story of HEROINOHIO begins as a profile of these two brothers but soon unfolds into a raw account of a fight against the powerful grip of addiction, revealing the relentless resilience required to reclaim oneâ€™s life.","popularity":0.3601,"poster_path":"/5CT8H8rvKNW1dRqan5VV9VdumxP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HEROINOHIO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5185159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Rollins","original_name":"Mike Rollins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"678a38e3dbfe50aa3d1d1c3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5185160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Rollins","original_name":"Chuck Rollins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"678a38eddbfe50aa3d1d1c4a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5180686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan C.
