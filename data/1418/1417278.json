All but Canada were neutral before World War II. Today, only Sweden has not joined a military alliance, but with American and Soviet military forces in the northern seas, even its lone neutrality is at risk. Archival footage from the two world wars, animated maps, and interviews illuminate the historical shaping of each country's stance on neutrality and approach to its own defense, and how these positions work for and against the countries. The film's thesis is that a non-aligned north is the key to separating the superpowers and attaining world peace.","popularity":0.1154,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harder Than It Looks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gwynne Dyer","original_name":"Gwynne Dyer","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":"/1QDDOgbkPPkkxXW2NirUtaduK8A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6785ed7e1fc0ec7f087afdca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Viljoen","original_name":"Tina Viljoen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6785ed1cc81acaa63dbc1f48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie Howells","original_name":"Barrie Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wl9j33wHjYwssXlzwnlDwjyFBRX.jpg","credit_id":"67873f398d49c44fa5bb0856","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie Howells","original_name":"Barrie Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wl9j33wHjYwssXlzwnlDwjyFBRX.jpg","credit_id":"67873f441fc0ec7f087b2c9f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gwynne Dyer","original_name":"Gwynne Dyer","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":"/1QDDOgbkPPkkxXW2NirUtaduK8A.jpg","credit_id":"67873f501fc0ec7f087b2ca3","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Viljoen","original_name":"Tina Viljoen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67873f581fc0ec7f087b2caa","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099076,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephan Steinhouse","original_name":"Stephan Steinhouse","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67873f69db4fe022ad4eb726","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3327303,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Guy Normandin","original_name":"Jean-Guy Normandin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67873fa61fc0ec7f087b2cdf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152507,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Drouin","original_name":"Jacques Drouin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67873fb384160ff0a47af037","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099076,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephan Steinhouse","original_name":"Stephan Steinhouse","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67873fc11fc0ec7f087b2d15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025905,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julian Olson","original_name":"Julian Olson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67873fcd84160ff0a47af048","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Savas Kalogeras","original_name":"Savas Kalogeras","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67981bc83ae355c4788f4e37","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068485,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kent Nason","original_name":"Kent Nason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fujgwp9srNvqZJn0FR9V7hkjrHo.jpg","credit_id":"67981c7ddf4b0191ce2b1cdb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barry Perles","original_name":"Barry Perles","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679824bc9a30a85b2724054f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223428","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
