Dr David Vaughan has been studying corals his whole life, but until eight years ago, could only watch the crisis unfold. After an accident one day in the lab, Vaughan discovered a secret of coral reproduction, and is now working to replant dwindling coral reefs at an astonishing rate. The Atlantic visited Dr Vaughan in the Florida Keys to uncover how the process works and understand how much hope there is to revitalize our reefs.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":"/hzAWq8Bh7ojHq0Zebk6PxO0iBqK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Coral Reef Revival","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Price-Waldman","original_name":"Sam Price-Waldman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678685e5fe294a0b474e7b57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5529892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hzAWq8Bh7ojHq0Zebk6PxO0iBqK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3343,"name":"coral reef"},{"id":191509,"name":"news"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
