Combative twin musicians hunt for their dying poet father, in an improvisation performed by the director’s own family, in a single unbroken shot through the streets of San Francisco.  One brother seeks love and excitement, while the other seeks to disappear into his music. But as night falls and their father remains missing, their frantic safari leads them from the secret haunts of the Beat poets into the heart of their family. The journey becomes a universal story about the difficulty of letting go of the people we love, and a testament to the power of music, brotherhood, & the lifeblood of a city - experienced by the viewer in real-time.","popularity":0.5798,"poster_path":"/852gxenWteTCrsf8YqFebdTA8eH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This then is a song.","title":"Brother Verses Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Gold","original_name":"Ari Gold","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/amDEDdy8XOM8iR1EgLpa3V4YxAZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ari Gold","credit_id":"6786df1f2b1e40e83fbb233a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587779,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ethan Gold","original_name":"Ethan Gold","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ethan Gold","credit_id":"6786df2b136e157cf27bab21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Louise","original_name":"Lara Louise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lara Louise","credit_id":"6786df4bcaa53e90987aed1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tongo Eisen-Martin","original_name":"Tongo Eisen-Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tongo Eisen-Martin","credit_id":"6786df58b50c71db5c4e52ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":187214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Bell","original_name":"Brian Bell","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Brian Bell","credit_id":"6786df65caa53e90987aed2b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Gold","original_name":"Herbert Gold","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/hPkYm8sL3T3OzFGK5ChQNy3AgsY.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Herbert Gold","credit_id":"67ce9c82d95e411dd02a6a19","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Gold","original_name":"Ari Gold","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/amDEDdy8XOM8iR1EgLpa3V4YxAZ.jpg","credit_id":"67919c7b749b2bc5b546f176","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4517512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle G.
