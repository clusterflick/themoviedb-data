The story begins with Marina, a homeowner who, along with her husband and two children, built her dream home on Sadovaya Street, 17, in Vuhledar. This house was a symbol of love, family, and stability, filled with the warmth of daily life and celebrations. But when war struck in February 2022, their home became a place of unspeakable sorrow, and their lives were abruptly upended. Olexii’s story provides a harrowing account of survival. Once an IT graduate, his life took a drastic turn when he was captured by Russian forces and held as a POW in the basement of Marina's home. His journey is one of starvation, injury, and suffering, but also of a miraculous rescue and, ultimately, hope.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Number 17: My House of Horrors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Goryanov","original_name":"Андрей Горянов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786da1f601acfe7bd4f8e09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179660,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dmytro Vlasov","original_name":"Дмитров Власов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786da9c2b1e40e83fbb20f1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3693794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertram Hill","original_name":"Bertram Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786dac2b50c71db5c4e5150","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5179662,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ned Davies","original_name":"Ned Davies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786dae5b50c71db5c4e5169","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5179668,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Kuryshko","original_name":"Diana Kuryshko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786db26b50c71db5c4e5190","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4593798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsiana Yanutsevich","original_name":"Tatsiana Yanutsevich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786db5c136e157cf27baa0d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3693791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktoria Arakelyan","original_name":"Viktoria Arakelyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786dbe7136e157cf27baa25","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3255487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Preobrazhenskaya","original_name":"Татьяна Преображенская","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786dbf48d49c44fa5bb0025","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
