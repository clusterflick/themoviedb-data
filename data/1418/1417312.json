In this work, I used Vnspeech robotic voice engine to read the story, then mix this with music from \"Kids with guns\" by Gorillaz. Afterwards, I made a 3D model based on Vietnamese propaganda posters to insert into Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The work addresses the duality between history and fiction.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tfwW1k3dRuyT8zwcGK5ewPW7Diz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A fierce childhood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5178491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Le Bac Tan","original_name":"Le Bac Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67861d9aee84fa4def7bb90b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfwW1k3dRuyT8zwcGK5ewPW7Diz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1001}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
