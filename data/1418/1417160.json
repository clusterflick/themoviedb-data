Its legend has been woven into our artworks and stories for thousands of years from the ancient Egyptians to young children today fascinated by the idea of the fastest land animal on Earth. Yet now the wild cheetah population is on the brink. In the last century, their population has collapsed by over 90%, and the Masai Mara in Kenya is one of the cheetahsâ€™ last remaining strongholds. Even here they are in decline. By speaking to researchers and conservationists this film seeks to highlight their plight - from natural vulnerabilities, to the introduced threat of mass tourism and human-wildlife conflict - while at the same time showing that when people come together with the common goal of conservation there is hope for these magnificent predators.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ixzenAA8TSaFAHHmqG9VYv9U4T3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Cheetahs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5177796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Clarkson","original_name":"Daniel Clarkson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678598891431e0591abbc924","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5177797,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Clarkson","original_name":"Daniel Clarkson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67859896db4fe022ad4e69c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5177798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Dyer","original_name":"Laura Dyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678598a3db4fe022ad4e69ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ixzenAA8TSaFAHHmqG9VYv9U4T3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
