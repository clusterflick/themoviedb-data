But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.  What led to that first groundbreaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.","popularity":0.5728,"poster_path":"/lSU85MrxOtlrvtiRlI9GTPBGiwK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":209856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Exhibition on Screen (GB)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn of Impressionism: Paris 1874","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2479475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Ray","original_name":"Ali Ray","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6785a922c81acaa63dbc17ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6785a931bd793c03544ee47e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35397631","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sBtuuQ2MPliv76mjckkfwB3mNNO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lSU85MrxOtlrvtiRlI9GTPBGiwK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/fzt4GWqg1WIQVw74tLyQgoNYJin.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2493,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8VZYxgaGe09cPO5vH29CgYSN37e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1662}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207928,"name":"19th century"},{"id":252194,"name":"french impressionism"},{"id":303954,"name":"art documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"ahXVMZenea0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2025-02-11T11:34:37.000Z","id":"67dc36b49f358f4a137fb288"}]}}}
