It is abandoned time after time in this shocking, utterly compelling exploration of the profession’s collusion with state sponsored torture over the past 70 years. Director Stephen Bennett untangles a web of secrecy, denial and complicity to explore the legacy of Scottish-born psychiatrist Dr Ewen Cameron and the experiments that helped devise systems of torture employed across the globe, from Northern Ireland to Guantanamo Bay. Experts, victims and families provide chapter and verse on fundamental violations of human rights.","popularity":0.2249,"poster_path":"/t0BJlLIAZrVp7OuFqf5zC9pRrha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":146877,"logo_path":"/xdxXUXaOlu9HRJk4cQfZvmPeYfM.png","name":"Sideways Film","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":13788,"logo_path":"/dNLCLFvMac9l8xIBhKOyJKfef7u.png","name":"Hopscotch Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eminent Monsters: A Manual For Modern Torture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moazzam Begg","original_name":"Moazzam Begg","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c7c886bc3a36843ed177d5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4775417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewen Cameron","original_name":"Ewen Cameron","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"666cb0df6ef49c8aae1888b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4775418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Corbett","original_name":"Christine Corbett","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"666cb10c28c1e66ab738b154","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Fallon","original_name":"Mark Fallon","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"666cb120e3d5d47c1e38b0d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3326363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Mitchell","original_name":"James Mitchell","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"666cb1bec0879d16e352281b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4775424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Reisner","original_name":"Steven Reisner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"666cb1e315a6654c4d2d09dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522040,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mohamedou Ould Slahi","original_name":"Mohamedou Ould Slahi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"666cb1eefb1667415d522864","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Bennett","original_name":"Stephen Bennett","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7c88450e0a26322b0dea42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t0BJlLIAZrVp7OuFqf5zC9pRrha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":997,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/t91jJtrZE8H4ccSV4AoyrjAWAoz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":681}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eminent Monsters - Official Trailer","key":"5P3RPWahMwk","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-07T16:47:33.000Z","id":"6147c49170309f008b9b8f4d"}]}}}
