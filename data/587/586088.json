It is this memory which is said to bind a parent and a child, a husband and a wife or any other intimate relationships. The film explores Shatarupa’s search for her father in Kolkata. She finds the voice of her father in a young man. The paternal traits draw her towards him, but she finds herself trapped elsewhere between emotional complexities and simplicity. The film also draws a parallel with Hindu mythological tale of Lord Brahma, who was attracted to his own daughter Shatarupa","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/7QrF9N4dXy5J0tS5GcU1DLKxuVe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runanubandha - The He Without Him","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priyanka Ghosh Roy","original_name":"Priyanka Ghosh Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Shatarupa Biswas","credit_id":"5c7ce18a92514175a247274e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Michael Hementa Biswas (voice)","credit_id":"5c7ce19e0e0a2631f80e612c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256902,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Swastik Choudhury","original_name":"Swastik Choudhury","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bhola","credit_id":"5c7ce1af9251417db2471cf6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjita Mukherjee","original_name":"Sanjita Mukherjee","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lolita","credit_id":"5c7ce1c29251411e7346ede8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5c7ce0bfc3a36843ed17f128","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5c7ce0e6c3a36843ed17f161","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256902,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Swastik Choudhury","original_name":"Swastik Choudhury","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7ce10e0e0a2631f80e60aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256903,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kisaloy Roy","original_name":"Kisaloy Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7ce124925141737f47242d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5ccbe6f30e0a262fb300af7e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Amartya Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/zq8tMOZjfY67MdHNKDGtU4BYrRb.jpg","credit_id":"5ccbe6f8925141046126a487","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8384842","wikidata_id":"Q65084736","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7QrF9N4dXy5J0tS5GcU1DLKxuVe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kolkata International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Runanubandha (The HE without HIM) | Official Trailer | An Amartya Bhattacharyya film","key":"bzKa_mjOeqA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-18T18:00:29.000Z","id":"5ccbe73cc3a36836b0dacace"}]}}}
