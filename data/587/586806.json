Two cameras film in alternation this derelict facade from two changing viewpoints. They pan in opposing crossways movements and develop a picture view that appears to extend beyond the edges of the screen. The durations and sequencing of one shot in relation to another are not pre-scripted; the shooting patterns take the form of a space-time game where a new movement or action on one camera provokes a corresponding reaction from the second camera.” –William Raban","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fXOL5KCVeLBhPvITcV07hPQBueR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Stepping","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Raban","original_name":"William Raban","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/4aQQfFizVMjdkkLkhQedcXe4YoA.jpg","credit_id":"5c81ae850e0a2643105f3253","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXOL5KCVeLBhPvITcV07hPQBueR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
