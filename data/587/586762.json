Life is wonderful by the glistening sea, but winter is coming and the newcomers know nothing of its perils.  Ulla-Lena Lundberg’s Ice was awarded the 2012 Finlandia prize and has become the most cherished Finnish novel of the decade. It has attracted much interest from theatres, but the Finnish National Opera is the first to get permission to adapt it for the stage. Juhani Koivisto’s libretto follows the key events and characters of the novel, with music by Jaakko Kuusisto that rings with the changing seasons and the ever-present threat of ice.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/twiozmDCX5RhuNyPWFLiZkWuB9U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice - Kuusisto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ville Rusanen","original_name":"Ville Rusanen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c814a65c3a3684e9bd62a48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjukka Tepponen","original_name":"Marjukka Tepponen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c814a6bc3a3684e9dd65cea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sointu Wessmann","original_name":"Sointu Wessmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c814a720e0a2643035eaf7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Groth","original_name":"Markus Groth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c814a78925141277d1b2d9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jussi Merikanto","original_name":"Jussi Merikanto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c814a7f0e0a26430a5ebc8a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3416726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jaakko Kuusisto","original_name":"Jaakko Kuusisto","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62011ac5d34eb3009d255cfe","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Kelo","original_name":"Anna Kelo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c814aaac3a3684e8cd63325","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2501,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/twiozmDCX5RhuNyPWFLiZkWuB9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
