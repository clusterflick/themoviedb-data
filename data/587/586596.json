The film tells about the daily life and dreams of the youth community and a mute fish, the so-called commune T17. The community lives in a non-landscaped building, so its occupation is a real challenge. The house is located under the paspārns of the association \" Free Riga \", whose movement is based on a responsible attitude towards nature and the careful use of resources. Here, the community is motivated by the conviction that so few resources in everyday life should be consumed in the urban environment. The film follows the everyday life of the community members, who use their lifestyle to use the resources of nature, material, culture and time.","popularity":0.2858,"poster_path":"/lam02WIdFu7GfQT2mc6AUs1fuBW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23992,"logo_path":null,"name":"On the Road","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brīva vieta - Lastādija","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Brīva vieta - T17","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2259020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selga Stūris","original_name":"Selga Stūris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c80134d0e0a26430a5cc273","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2259022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dzintars Briedis","original_name":"Dzintars Briedis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c801372c3a3684e8fd42c14","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2259023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mārcis Rubenis","original_name":"Mārcis Rubenis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c801384c3a3684e92d4650f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1931686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aija Bley","original_name":"Aija Bley","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/9IHVdi96Ke784ScEVXWNBUgaOhA.jpg","credit_id":"5c80139ec3a3684e92d46531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749698,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dainis Juraga","original_name":"Dainis Juraga","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc933db470ead0013984e74","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777839,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artis Dukaļskis","original_name":"Artis Dukaļskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc933fa99259c665e7b5a94","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454891,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marta Bite","original_name":"Marta Bite","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc934296c0e4f00133d092a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454890,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lāsma Ābele","original_name":"Lāsma Ābele","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc93418470ead0013984f51","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1931686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aija Bley","original_name":"Aija Bley","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/9IHVdi96Ke784ScEVXWNBUgaOhA.jpg","credit_id":"5fe6ac405be00e003fa59c0d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lam02WIdFu7GfQT2mc6AUs1fuBW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c5aNtmV4qj5ZUQQZN6BfYt14vP9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":260611,"name":"urban tribe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
