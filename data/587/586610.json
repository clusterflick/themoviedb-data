Dreier to the performer Josephine Baker. The video, Insistence (2013), created by Andrea Geyer and recently acquired by MoMA, reveals a massive network of women who laid out the cultural landscape of modernism. This network is exposed by weaving together stories about the periodâ€™s unsung heroes: women. These stories highlight the everyday lived experiences of the women featured on the postcards, and their commitment to the arts at large. The continuous stacking of their portraits alludes to the fact that their influence is far-reaching, underrepresented, and an ongoing process that deserves further consideration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ubihd8hq3KSlYqNDCUwLN9CqNsE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insistence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Geyer","original_name":"Andrea Geyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8027f4925141277a194f8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ubihd8hq3KSlYqNDCUwLN9CqNsE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1046}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
