At 7.30pm, Nancyâ€™s husband Jim called the police.\r What followed was one of the biggest manhunts the nation had ever seen. More than 52 years later, the manhunt continues.","popularity":0.06,"poster_path":"/uf0552OX8HOQNoDaUURUFqwUWtB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46814,"logo_path":"/b3sb5sFRj0EEpMHlNtFBO0fQKSw.png","name":"Seven Network","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Really Happened to the Beaumont Children?","title":"The Beaumont Children: What Really Happened","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gareth Harvey","original_name":"Gareth Harvey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c82dc55c3a3684e9bd874cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7950360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wccTN3TRr0tMHAHvfgVOoZZZ5lV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uf0552OX8HOQNoDaUURUFqwUWtB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
