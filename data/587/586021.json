Stored in a permafrost deep-freeze for years, these remains are in pristine condition and represent an unprecedented window into the life of the Pleistocene Epoch. John finds a passion for bones and for collecting, assembling over a hundred thousand specimens from his mine site, â€œThe Boneyard,\" and invites a team of expert paleontologists to study the collection. As the scientists wade into the mud, and peruse the boxes of the collection, discoveries are made that could potentially re-write the history of North America.","popularity":0.1033,"poster_path":"/hvDHsKyg13xABUXkrlMXNTYHy36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115514,"logo_path":null,"name":"GlacierFilm, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boneyard Alaska","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Boneyard","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Reeves","original_name":"John Reeves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c7c5f0a0e0a2632130dad4f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Andrew Lawrence","original_name":"Paul Andrew Lawrence","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7c5f700e0a2632290db440","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hvDHsKyg13xABUXkrlMXNTYHy36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mDgS7hZxZp1ccY4wDiEby0F39Q3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Austin, TX","release_date":"2019-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Boneyard Trailer","key":"euJmNI4wftE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-01-17T21:50:04.000Z","id":"5c7c603692514137d74688e7"}]}}}
