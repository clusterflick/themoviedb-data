Just then, as Leon is taking the necklace out of his pocket, Mrs. Errol arrives with Barbara, her cousin and Barbara's fiancee. Mrs. Errol decides to give the necklace to Barbara as a wedding present. Leon tells Rita he will retrieve the necklace and return it to her that night. That Leon ends up getting chased by a guard dog and accused by Dorothy of philandering and Rita is a crook is a foregone conclusion.","popularity":0.5202,"poster_path":"/slJb27quqrXjpQkVq3yEYkztHVF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'll Take Milk","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Errol","original_name":"Leon Errol","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/8jV6d5rKmmXn69TRbm4Ndehdrpr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7dea820e0a2642fb5960f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7dea8c0e0a2642fe595e34","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrna Dell","original_name":"Myrna Dell","popularity":0.1859,"profile_path":"/qzAmIJL3jh24x29HfQAJPd6dLrt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7dea940e0a2642fb596138","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Warren","original_name":"Phil Warren","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7deaa0c3a3684e95d0d3f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Carleton","original_name":"Claire Carleton","popularity":0.6203,"profile_path":"/flBJkYz97lG0EYa31FUNBlNiB6q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7deaaec3a3684e95d0d3ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Robards Sr.","original_name":"Jason Robards Sr.","popularity":0.3321,"profile_path":"/bTAO5oYzTCYc62FJ27Ivei0KAAl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7deab9925141277a160f35","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Frederick","original_name":"Lee Frederick","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7deac6c3a3684e8cd0d124","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257618,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Russ Green","original_name":"Russ Green","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7dea680e0a264303595efa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163076,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Bilson","original_name":"George Bilson","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7dea4f9251412769160e27","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Yates","original_name":"Hal Yates","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7dea3ec3a3684e92d0dda1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/slJb27quqrXjpQkVq3yEYkztHVF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qbhaS9SQdXpDnUwNU93rXwYVCmF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1946-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
