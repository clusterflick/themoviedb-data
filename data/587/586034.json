Rather, it offered an exclusive, \"behind the scenes\" look into WWE and its talent, both in-ring and otherwise.[1] The show also periodically broke kayfabe and used professional wrestling slang. Confidential was discontinued in 2004 and was replaced with The WWE Experience, a more traditional weekly summary show.","popularity":1.5363,"poster_path":"/8ZrjnP2mKtaH8OZ700QOk4c9fSQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WWE: The Best of WWE Confidential, Vol. 1","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Stratigeas","original_name":"Patricia Stratigeas","popularity":0.314,"profile_path":"/5ZlHcnJxU0cHIa0e7IwCoFpoGRm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7c754ac3a3684a951771fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Okerlund","original_name":"Gene Okerlund","popularity":0.2952,"profile_path":"/cnm3CRU5pv4xNqmhcjjLz6rBmVv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02cb409251416876bad10b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57342,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vince McMahon","original_name":"Vince McMahon","popularity":0.7395,"profile_path":"/3m4Z7YwnTqgLlQWP7A7TgYOJrj7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02cbb6c3a368431e1f2eb2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bret Hart","original_name":"Bret Hart","popularity":0.6607,"profile_path":"/hwGt7DD0he5GFGB1utzk7fegyhp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7c7540c3a3687117175f88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hickenbottom","original_name":"Michael Hickenbottom","popularity":0.5753,"profile_path":"/dZ77iyoHzPZoQn8Tfr5wHHjFCb6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c92b9829251413c0d5dd17c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hulk Hogan","original_name":"Hulk Hogan","popularity":0.9661,"profile_path":"/i27iSeP7hhtlFOeVnthRQ9Ox2m4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02c9a7c3a368445b26ee1f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Angle","original_name":"Kurt Angle","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/b6KDyo7Xq2TNjAL3Flv0R22hejs.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02cc5b0e0a26615bcb8cb6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Orton","original_name":"Randy Orton","popularity":0.7329,"profile_path":"/efN2loWLhV0x0HIfyZP7Kio8Qp8.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02cc7c92514163d1ba180b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bischoff","original_name":"Eric Bischoff","popularity":0.2227,"profile_path":"/4IHs3B0cYouILSGpTnk0YKeK6Kk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7c752c925141737f46a0da","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57342,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vince McMahon","original_name":"Vince McMahon","popularity":0.7395,"profile_path":"/3m4Z7YwnTqgLlQWP7A7TgYOJrj7.jpg","credit_id":"5d02cbd6c3a3687b571eb72f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57342,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vince McMahon","original_name":"Vince McMahon","popularity":0.7395,"profile_path":"/3m4Z7YwnTqgLlQWP7A7TgYOJrj7.jpg","credit_id":"5d02cbe2c3a368489e1fb765","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bq6dTGXsgpWwelrLm8ZGFxMQWHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ZrjnP2mKtaH8OZ700QOk4c9fSQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WWE Confidential: The Death of Miss Elizabeth","key":"d5dnzNTikXU","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-03-02T04:05:09.000Z","id":"5d02c8d1c3a3687b571eafaa"}]}}}
