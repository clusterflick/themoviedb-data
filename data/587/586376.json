The main character wakes up and realizes that he has spent over 50 years in a coma, but has not aged at all. Nobody knows what happened to him. Fragments of memories lead him to a remote village, far away from civilization, where he had traveled half a century ago to study a mysterious radio signal. There is now a research station there that studies strange local anomalies. The main character starts his own investigation and gradually uncovers the events of the past. Many years ago, local residents discovered a crashed alien spaceship a few kilometers away from the village. The ship contained alien bodies inside sarcophagi. It turned out that the ship’s technology slows down the aging process, and the village residents started worshipping the dormant aliens, believing them to be gods.","popularity":0.1827,"poster_path":"/ebUKDjz4daUAw2IdaLeB712Z9kI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinodanz","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Zabytyye bogi","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2217042,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandr Kurinsky","original_name":"Alexandr Kurinsky","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7e79d0925141276616cb65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Boguslavskiy","original_name":"Александр Богуславский","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/i7zTQNNxssW8jKjBPYhfBTvgEEW.jpg","credit_id":"5c7e7990c3a3684e8fd1a027","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790720,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Viktor Denisyuk","original_name":"Viktor Denisyuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7e79c9c3a3684e92d1cdf3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1790721,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evgeniy Melentev","original_name":"Evgeniy Melentev","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/5It9kLZLYn3zpwVqIkfYaWO4lTW.jpg","credit_id":"5c7e79c1c3a3684e9bd19f42","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Timofey Dekin","original_name":"Тимофей Декин","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7e79a20e0a2642fe5a2e0f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/vyMyuwV1e5HhE6g0ZfbHCWIQAYR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ebUKDjz4daUAw2IdaLeB712Z9kI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
