That’s where the ATF’s National Tracing Center handles roughly 8,000 active traces per day — all while inside a government-mandated technology time-capsule that makes searching a database of gun owners impossible. This is nothing like those cop shows you watch. With more gun stores in the U.S.A. than McDonalds, Starbucks, and supermarkets combined, there’s a lot of paperwork to manually sort through. And it's truly a sight to behold.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zVUW1Eo6j6sncj6Qg4B8iw8s0zQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An American paper trail.","title":"Guns Found Here","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Freid","original_name":"David Freid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a87f8ce0e0a26400b04e94b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8005982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVUW1Eo6j6sncj6Qg4B8iw8s0zQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
