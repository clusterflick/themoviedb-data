The film uses a fictional narrative with period reconstruction and is supported by archival material to illustrate the changes in health policies over time. The film's language adapts to the predominant media of each depicted period, such as newspapers, radio, black-and-white TV, color TV, and finally, the internet.  It was produced through the initiative of the Secretariat of Strategic and Participative Management of the Ministry of Health, in partnership with the Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde (OPAS) and the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF). It is intended for free distribution, especially focusing on Health Councils, educational institutions, and social movements. A version with Spanish and English subtitles is under discussion to expand its reach.","popularity":0.1056,"poster_path":"/tONoNogjfJJgUqJdhbOa5vhuv4f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Health Policies in Brazil: A Century of Struggle for the Right to Health","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1649396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renato Tapajós","original_name":"Renato Tapajós","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/1TdehrzrxzmiKtA2a8jOuVjxSrG.jpg","credit_id":"5a830c06c3a3684ce2013669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eEM7oyZPyONBn17r7eiZ29XD85i.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hRTzC6RbIm71nZaAOiGO6axbB1v.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJqoFPmunbDpOZeSQ49LNlGY5U3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6WPaGeTXqXrp7QsM8jqyeYoSidR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/tONoNogjfJJgUqJdhbOa5vhuv4f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1413,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/4PhJaBYYF7u6r44lMKiAcBWBKdH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":942}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
