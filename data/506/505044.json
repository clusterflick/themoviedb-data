Riots on the street, old-Etonians in government, a workforce on strike, \"Downton Abbey\", \"The King's Speech\", the royal wedding and vajazzling. In this one-off special, Frank Skinner is joined by comedians Micky Flanagan, Roisin Conaty and Miles Jupp to assess whether class is still relevant in the 21st century. Probing analysis meets comedy chat, as our comics become intrepid reporters, examining the subject through their own unorthodox reports.","popularity":0.9229,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Class Dismissed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Skinner","original_name":"Frank Skinner","popularity":0.2587,"profile_path":"/nL047BSNBR9PYnJxXoSkqLf9Tqe.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5a832999c3a3682ddf0001e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micky Flanagan","original_name":"Micky Flanagan","popularity":0.2827,"profile_path":"/penlJ1yX8WJt1VdSKj6ycufIXG7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5a8329ab0e0a26400e00022c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Jupp","original_name":"Miles Jupp","popularity":0.2476,"profile_path":"/xVNI6kPi16lpIce0WQfS3DnIspT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5a8329c1c3a3682db6000254","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1653876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roisin Conaty","original_name":"Roisin Conaty","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":"/xWNKOCqrkOTQlGrXReq4liFGKXW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5a8329cf9251417590000271","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1523248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Gompertz","original_name":"Will Gompertz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3UGlhNFS1ZdN17ypt36qJeInKjw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5a832c450e0a26400e0005a7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1220428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Colin Swash","original_name":"Colin Swash","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8329e0925141759f000281","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan Swimer","original_name":"Dan Swimer","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8329ec0e0a26401c0002d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geraldine Dowd","original_name":"Geraldine Dowd","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a832a0b92514175930002af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Derek McLean","original_name":"Derek McLean","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8329ff9251417599000262","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Wicks","original_name":"Ben Wicks","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a832a1c0e0a26401c000310","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11935,"name":"working class"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2011-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Micky Flanagan Takes On Modern Art - Class Dismissed - BBC Two","key":"fz5uwMZUKlg","published_at":"2011-12-12T17:06:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"5a832b39925141759f000404"}]}}}
