In 1971, he bought a house in Tangiers where he settled down a few years later, at the age of 51, for a cosy and opulent retirement. “My Sweet Little Ass” is the account of his personal life, which Jean Neuenschwander clearly takes delight in recounting. He is a likeable hedonist who manages his affairs and his pleasures with considerable skill. From this somewhat comfortable existence, Simon Bischoff subtly extracts a group portrait of the homosexual subculture of Tangiers, which for some has the power of myth, particulary when frequented by characters such as Paul Bowles.","popularity":0.1131,"poster_path":"/fVm0TJVAw1yaDT4hIlYOxvQBcd9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1998-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Sweet Little Ass","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Mein süßer kleiner Arsch","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":266350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Bowles","original_name":"Paul Bowles","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/uZkA2913FoM9BP3YFXc00xn00Dv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a86481b9251417599031202","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Mynott","original_name":"Patricia Mynott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a864832925141759303243e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Neuenschwander","original_name":"Jean Neuenschwander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a864839c3a36863e702e617","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Bischoff","original_name":"Simon Bischoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640e581b7c59006b121860","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Bischoff","original_name":"Simon Bischoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640e3aed2ac2003951bde1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Bischoff","original_name":"Simon Bischoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640e43d6d64d005458be2f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":43882,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Buzi","original_name":"Sergio Buzi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640e6404863800281fe11f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Bischoff","original_name":"Simon Bischoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a86480bc3a368620702e39d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0177008","wikidata_id":"Q66712811","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swO2xgqQ0YI5tm4JGxoKVQYPjUv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":824,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/fVm0TJVAw1yaDT4hIlYOxvQBcd9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/NyCPxoIyTp1uy8CMFK0WW9OjAL.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1175,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/1nJierkFtWFM7c95SKKyKnrEl4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":783}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
