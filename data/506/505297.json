Accurately recounting the energy and rawness of the era, this drama follows their tumultuous and ill-fated journey on the rocky road to success. It takes three long years of unpaid performing for Reena, her lover Jessop, bassist Joe and drummer Petie to make a name for The Dead Patriots. Just as they are about to find real success, internal difficulties arise that leave each of them suspicious and mistrustful of the other.","popularity":0.8663,"poster_path":"/chYJTihJDvaBtLacxB17wvEDaoS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Bus Home","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Ryan","original_name":"Annie Ryan","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/7qHqYiVfhyS6fc8nlfxLuWeIKBY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reena","credit_id":"5a850f7e0e0a2653db01abe8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brían F.
