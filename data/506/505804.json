Turkey still denies it ever happened. Laurence Jourdan examines massacres of Armenians in the decades leading up to the mass murder, and the geopolitical situation both before and after the genocide. Contemporaneous reports and documents written by Western diplomats stationed in the Ottoman Empire describe the methods used and the deportation routes. These accounts are mixed with personal stories from the living survivors and archive footage from Ottoman authorities.","popularity":0.4759,"poster_path":"/hksFx9jeqXRpxTvgzAAdtY1NV7s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":80138,"logo_path":"/sfVmSNU1aq6g6zZ7DsdPYIHqZ3R.png","name":"CPB Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Armenian Genocide","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1909993,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arnaud Mansir","original_name":"Arnaud Mansir","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbefaacffeed0164c0129e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Louis Valéro","original_name":"Jean-Louis Valéro","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbef94e194b001844eaf57","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Faudel","original_name":"Sophie Faudel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbf0bf6dc5070149b17e89","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4535018,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Boulège","original_name":"Françoise Boulège","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbf053cffeed014abfa020","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Jourdan","original_name":"Laurence Jourdan","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a887d170e0a2653b3055be2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0885533","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Xo6UX6sk8CzVDVMa8IcceFmFK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hksFx9jeqXRpxTvgzAAdtY1NV7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1128,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1YFkfvnpfl8ZiY2ffUsJlAkTZ7T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":752}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5733,"name":"turkey"},{"id":6520,"name":"armenia"},{"id":9281,"name":"ethnic cleansing"},{"id":14900,"name":"genocide"},{"id":184996,"name":"armenian genocide"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"History Channel","release_date":"2014-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"DVD","release_date":"2005-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Arte","release_date":"2005-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PBS","release_date":"2006-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
