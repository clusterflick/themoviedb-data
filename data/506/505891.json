Even Richard's own family no longer relates to him, and has been consumed by their own inexplicable, unavoidable anger. All around him the news screens report society's growing chaos, mass protests, riots, and controversial video footage of prisoners left to die in solitary confinement. In desperation, Richard quits his job and leaves his family, trying to escape the growing danger of the city, only to find himself in a face to face collision with his own fear and anger.","popularity":0.0638,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flammable","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1980457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Bennett","original_name":"Neil Bennett","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"5a88e12f0e0a2652ab05b7db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Plante","original_name":"Samuel Plante","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a88e0f6925141759305caac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Plante","original_name":"Samuel Plante","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a88e1090e0a2653db0620e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2217966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
