Anchored by a buoyant electronic soundtrack by British composer Delia Derbyshire (known for her groundbreaking work with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop), the filmmakers brought Derbyshire to Amsterdam for the shoot, so that they might create ideas together and so that she could experience the rhythms of the city. The film explores different ideas of work, connection and positioning: a bridge means something different to a builder, an architect or someone walking over it.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/wfXp2Zuou1J0hJb3ncPugF0MXw1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Bridges","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Plug","original_name":"Marian Plug","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a83c8f1925141759300a2ee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551869,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elsa Stansfield","original_name":"Elsa Stansfield","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a83c8bfc3a36862e1004eb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madelon Hooykaas","original_name":"Madelon Hooykaas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a83c8cec3a36862a7004ac5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Delia Derbyshire","original_name":"Delia Derbyshire","popularity":0.1988,"profile_path":"/22TpzX17ZuIBcm0SH9H2rTmWQHQ.jpg","credit_id":"5a83c8dd9251410ac4004ba6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wfXp2Zuou1J0hJb3ncPugF0MXw1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
