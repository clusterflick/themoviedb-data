Heartfelt pathos blends with over-the-top comedy when the driving force behind a controversial theater group dies. Frank David Niles was the heart and soul of the \"In Your Face\" theater company, and now his friends and colleagues are determined to give him a proper send off. In addition to marking Crisp's final full-length feature performance, Red Ribbins also marks the return to the big screen for former The Devil in Miss Jones star Georgina Spelvin.","popularity":0.1216,"poster_path":"/xzBI08O5aVoxRSlyBXmTGfiqWWG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Ribbons","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quentin Crisp","original_name":"Quentin Crisp","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/9kp2xAPdUtZnmSTmpiNxoBQz5Tj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c25a0e0a26401100b595","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Parker","original_name":"Robert Parker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c2699251410aae004782","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":103769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgina Spelvin","original_name":"Georgina Spelvin","popularity":10.976,"profile_path":"/3nVkG9o5H8GYc5FNnhEMsSN3iLU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Niles","credit_id":"5a83c2750e0a26540c0043d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Princess Sandlin","original_name":"Princess Sandlin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c2839251410ac40044fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Burgess","original_name":"Victor Burgess","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c28c9251410aae0047b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Sharmat","original_name":"Lee Sharmat","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c29c9251410aae0047c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen O'Neill","original_name":"Colleen O'Neill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c2a10e0a2653b3004754","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022795,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Nahmod","original_name":"David Nahmod","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c2af9251417593009c79","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa DeCarlo","original_name":"Elisa DeCarlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a83c2b90e0a26401100b60b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Ira Needleman","original_name":"Neil Ira Needleman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a83c2359251410b01004214","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244755","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xzBI08O5aVoxRSlyBXmTGfiqWWG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
