George details the rise of Fluxus following a sensationalized tour of “concerts” in Europe in 1962, and continuing in New York for most of the 1960s and ’70s. During this time Maciunas was converting the dying industrial buildings of Soho into a network of artists’ lofts, creating one of the first official real estate co-ops of artist-owned buildings. Maciunas’s life and legacy—as recounted by artists of his generation, including Yoko Ono and Jonas Mekas—ignited debates that remain pivotal to artists working today.","popularity":0.2267,"poster_path":"/fqetUStaIo7mW1glGjY3X1YwKsx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jeffrey Perkins Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of George Maciunas and Fluxus","title":"George: The Story of George Maciunas and Fluxus","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"George - The Story of George Maciunas and Fluxus","type":"new title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"George","type":"original title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"George: The Story of George Maciunas and Fluxus","type":"new title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Ono","original_name":"Yoko Ono","popularity":0.4298,"profile_path":"/j254dQthJu2rR1DRXqRkvo1oUqN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bf43a679251415cc1096702","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bf43a70c3a368189f0a3ce0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Maciunas","original_name":"George Maciunas","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/yfid3TlAVPwHbt7fTuFW3BgENUx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5bf43eb29251417c1d02ebc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5c0fd32e0e0a2638cc0e53e0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Perkins","original_name":"Jeffrey Perkins","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a908f1b9251413359003dd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2179426,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jessie Stead","original_name":"Jessie Stead","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf442019251415cd1099bb7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Perkins","original_name":"Jeffrey Perkins","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8e1f868289a00021cbeeae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6515522","wikidata_id":"Q104898349","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5foVTaOWgVq1FSKlJpzbU1xxObd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fqetUStaIo7mW1glGjY3X1YwKsx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":546},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4rB8lQkz0SIuitGA2HSLuMlyyXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"MoMA Documentary Fortnight","release_date":"2018-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York City, New York","release_date":"2018-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"GEORGE: THE STORY OF GEORGE MACIUNAS AND FLUXUS trailer | BFI London Film Festival 2019","key":"9nmoolpEhGk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-09-25T12:53:14.000Z","id":"5d8e1f5b8289a00021cbedb9"}]}}}
