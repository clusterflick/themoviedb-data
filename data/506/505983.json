An immobile ferryboat. The characters are lonely passengers unconsciously seeking the feeling of belonging. Through what seems to be a moment of accidental physical contact, a new language starts to form between them. The film replaces words with gestures and it navigates around the structure of a relationship. The minimum amount of contact that takes place, becomes an alphabet. All the fragments of their encounter get mentally amplified by each one of them and end up forming a game.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tactilis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kleoniki Stanich","original_name":"Kleoniki Stanich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8993c60e0a2652ab065444","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
