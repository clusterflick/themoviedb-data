Mary Lee gets the facts, while Vera gets a prudish fairytale version. Their lives separate after graduation, Mary Lee becomes a nurse who falls in proper love with a Doctor, whereas Vera follows her mother's advice and seeks to marry a rich man, but falls for the unlawful and syphilitic charms of a wealthy cad. Mary Lee and her Doctor rescue Vera and help her get proper care after a series of revelations showing actual patients of the loathsome disease. Finally, Mary Lee and her new husband volunteer to help our boys fighting the Huns in France.","popularity":0.32,"poster_path":"/owP9Npb6Su6C4uXivyBDIEVOBcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101116,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.S. War Department","origin_country":""},{"id":101117,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Social Hygiene Association","origin_country":""},{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bennett","original_name":"Richard Bennett","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/c5nP1JoOMAikC2zPrW9yu6okrh0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"5a89496b9251410b4d05c825","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Adams","original_name":"Claire Adams","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/2My48FqA4jYmwBjA6gsNbIF9rkV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Lee","credit_id":"5a89497cc3a3686316065977","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1980565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Fair","original_name":"Joyce Fair","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/vVLcq85ghmFszfP0qpsLCkfVmL9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vera Lynch","credit_id":"5a89498f925141759905f10e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond McKee","original_name":"Raymond McKee","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/isrYJkY4zSGk8lLYa2CQikf3m53.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a894999c3a36862e1061975","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maude Hill","original_name":"Maude Hill","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/gKZ2d90rDzvjxlDyGworqk2Oyrr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a8949a59251410b4d05c862","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cain","original_name":"Robert Cain","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/aBGtUfw3WZo0iF0y5EaYCoIIpz2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a8949b30e0a26540c05e383","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Housman","original_name":"Arthur Housman","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/2fPg5nQenEcivr5yAHDafZP76h9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a8949bcc3a36862e106198e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Brady","original_name":"Alice Brady","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":"/v9XVx9jV7ntUKog525jrYkSnq3n.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5a8949c5c3a368637c060f6b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Ferguson","original_name":"Helen Ferguson","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/iUdYOBg85MKCIE6vQk7vnIYIddq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Maid","credit_id":"5a8949d09251410a1f05f109","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467164,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katherine Bement Davis","original_name":"Katherine Bement Davis","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623124ab904f6d0046bc9d00","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467164,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katherine Bement Davis","original_name":"Katherine Bement Davis","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623124a47390c0001bc66a54","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":253066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward H.
