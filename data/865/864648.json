The idea of creating the tape was born in the process of working on films about Andrey Bitov and Boris Grebenshchikov. Then the director came up with and shot the frame \"Outgoing Youth\", which turned into a fairy tale about a man's dream: to gain additional freedom and ride a virgin. In 2002, the film participated in the program of the Film Festival \"Literature and Cinema\" in Gatchina and was awarded a special jury prize.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Will Be No Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1583227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Tikhomirov","original_name":"Виктор Тихомиров","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61237f6f6f53e10046b366dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
