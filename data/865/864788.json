Too often these debates have fallen into simplistic battles between those who claim that media images directly cause violence and those who argue that activists exaggerate the impact of media exposure.  Based on interviews conducted with George Gerbner before his death in 2005, the film urges us to think about media effects in more nuanced ways. In contrast to behaviorist models that see media violence as causing real-world violence, and limited effects models that question the impact of media altogether, Gerbner encourages us to move outside the frame of this debate to consider how the repetitive stories media tell constitute a pervasive cultural environment - a landscape of ritualized, often violent images that have the power to cultivate how we see and understand the world.","popularity":0.1874,"poster_path":"/coBeHEwGsR6vq61JDJGJn3Fctqz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":"/6kSyzXASYqFyD7HVPg32rTsprjd.png","name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Media Violence & the Cultivation of Fear","title":"The Mean World Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3209834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gerbner","original_name":"George Gerbner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6123e36f0102c9005db98ec5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Earp","original_name":"Jeremy Earp","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e2f40102c90024075adb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741790,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Morgan","original_name":"Michael Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e3106f53e10046b3e05c","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315298,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Scott Morris","original_name":"Scott Morris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e319e194b00044ca049b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315279,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Killoy","original_name":"Andrew Killoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e3220f2fbd00619ab3e6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loretta Alper","original_name":"Loretta Alper","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e33b6f53e10073b4740c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2098692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Killoy","original_name":"Andrew Killoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e343d6590b005d832a2c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2284246,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Young","original_name":"Jason Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123e3506f53e1002fffabed","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"65569dc353866e00ababbaa8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Earp","original_name":"Jeremy Earp","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6556ae127f0540011cc209df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/coBeHEwGsR6vq61JDJGJn3Fctqz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Mean World Syndrome Trailer","key":"16742175","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-11-11T20:06:43.000Z","id":"61eb8a0d31644b004529457e"}]}}}
