She finished actors’ studies in Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre and was about to start acting in Russian Drama Theatre. But a war started in Ukraine and she decided to go there. Joan collects and transports materials for the soldiers to the battlefield in Ukraine. Joan tries to keep balance between being one day in war, another in peace. The film is a journey from one world to another and the line between these worlds is not clear. You must reconsider the meaning of “reality”. Everything is mixed up: the war is “there”, but it could be “here” anytime.","popularity":0.0788,"poster_path":"/eNbmE8qC6jbjgOQaM916V8dLh5u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158003,"logo_path":"/58rlz0a17BkLfJKDPEvngC3O4DB.png","name":"Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2015-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The actress who chose the war instead of stage.","title":"Joan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","title":"Joan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2033568,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paulius Ivanauskas","original_name":"Paulius Ivanauskas","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122444cfcf90700469790db","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208033,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Donatas Bakonis","original_name":"Donatas Bakonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612244792dc44e0045c5c184","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170340,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Narvydas Naujalis","original_name":"Narvydas Naujalis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pZKAZkvxOgjtn5Ubxth4CNztRgo.jpg","credit_id":"612243b63a96500046e9a6d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2886579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vytautas Valiunas","original_name":"Vytautas Valiunas","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61224458d4b9d9005b48145c","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965966,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dagnė Puodžiūnaitė","original_name":"Dagnė Puodžiūnaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612243df3a96500046e9a710","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giedrė Žickytė","original_name":"Giedrė Žickytė","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/bXh9IOpFKRv5vcIIygK9WKCnSep.jpg","credit_id":"612243d1d70594005c00ae99","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Živilė Mičiulytė","original_name":"Živilė Mičiulytė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122439b0f2fbd006198350d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Živilė Mičiulytė","original_name":"Živilė Mičiulytė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612243edd6590b0045a81009","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Živilė Mičiulytė","original_name":"Živilė Mičiulytė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6145fd9bb5bc2100614a7272","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6090002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"%C5%BDana-Joan-1602125013439357","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eNbmE8qC6jbjgOQaM916V8dLh5u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":759,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i2eCEm6EwYXJ6lYZqTnmAjsMku0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER „Žana“ (\"Joan\")","key":"142217897","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-10-13T05:35:30.000Z","id":"612246a0fcf907002d330c51"}]}}}
