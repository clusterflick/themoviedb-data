With the help of classical documentary tools, such as interviews, narratives of experiences and statements made by the Romanies and the permanent residents of these regions, we are presented with an insight into the complex relationships between the Romanies and their neighbors and the attitudes of distance and derision, but also of sympathy and tolerance taken by the surrounding inhabitants. It is a tale without finite answers or truths. The answer is both close and yet far away, just like the eternally migratory people - the Romanies.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1Q0wnZ6suHpcTLZXT3tmwOIfRp8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viba film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":159490,"logo_path":null,"name":"AS Filmske alternative","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opre Roma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Filip Robar Dorin","original_name":"Filip Robar Dorin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6268142f7cffda009c302a20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Filip Robar Dorin","original_name":"Filip Robar Dorin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121282d595a560075e109de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Q0wnZ6suHpcTLZXT3tmwOIfRp8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sl","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
