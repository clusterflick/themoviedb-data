Meira Paibis are loosely structured groups of women from each locality who volunteered to vigil through the night as a peace-building effort.  ‘Fireflies’ takes us through the journey of these women in their struggles to protect their community from atrocities committed by the State. It explores the role of women in the conflict-ridden, male-dominated society of Manipur. Through powerful testimonies, this film looks into how gender identities are negotiated during the time of conflict and violence.","popularity":0.2159,"poster_path":"/lHDRto9cq9ecSqxKaO78YUnG85J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fireflies","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3207711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johnson Rajkumar","original_name":"Johnson Rajkumar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ysrrr5R3k6kFrnxhjy6uTCiuinv.jpg","credit_id":"6121d8fed4b9d90045b703b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438260,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Akash Basumatari","original_name":"Akash Basumatari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121d93ed70594002ee3eb25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3207714,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimbo Ningombam","original_name":"Jimbo Ningombam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121d955d70594005c004e5e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3207712,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andy Tourangbam","original_name":"Andy Tourangbam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121d9123876510045faf11b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3207711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johnson Rajkumar","original_name":"Johnson Rajkumar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ysrrr5R3k6kFrnxhjy6uTCiuinv.jpg","credit_id":"6121d9229f0e190028e120a4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8011806","wikidata_id":"Q117843103","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lHDRto9cq9ecSqxKaO78YUnG85J.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1746}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":284143,"name":"manipuri"},{"id":284144,"name":"manipur"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"Manipuri","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fireflies - A Manipuri Documentary | Trailer","key":"HoeoEOb6p0s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-12T14:59:17.000Z","id":"6121daca3a96500046e935eb"}]}}}
