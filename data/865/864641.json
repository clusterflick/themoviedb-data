Лев Толстой","overview":"The director tells the story of Boris Grebenshchikov through the image of Leo Tolstoy. According to Viktor Tikhomirov, both heroes are similar \"in their delusions and achievements\". The film has a lot of chronicles and, of course, Grebenshchikov's songs sound, and George Gunitsky described the tape after its premiere at Pushkinskaya 10: \"A completely untethered and insanely surreal film in a good way. And it is gratifying that all this postmodern film improvisation is involved on a cool aquarium basis. We need to look at the picture again once or twice, get a better understanding of it. And savor it. A very worthy work.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B.
