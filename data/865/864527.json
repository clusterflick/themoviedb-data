But Olga and Igor are not like that. They are honestly engaged with children on the slide, play, freeze, but fulfill their duty. Although, to be honest, they are a little bored. And they willy-nilly begin to look at each other, gradually drawing in their heads each their own image of the other. They already really want to start communicating, but upbringing, stereotypes and a story invented by everyone about a vis-a-vis prevents them from taking the first step. It already saddens them, because they really liked each other. Suddenly, children loudly reveal family secrets. It turns out that Igor is not a father, but a brother, and Olga is not a mother, but a grandmother in general. And both of them are free.","popularity":0.1776,"poster_path":"/7ejW87fQEstwy37OsiRa8BVcBxP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio 12","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moskovskaya Gorka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80999,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fyodor Bondarchuk","original_name":"Фёдор Бондарчук","popularity":0.907,"profile_path":"/uj63LFvCWAipD0UlTed8i8snE6b.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ангел 1","credit_id":"619f2f6466362700627c6942","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Smolyakov","original_name":"Андрей Смоляков","popularity":0.7744,"profile_path":"/AcuDKPIUa6xD3LYGqDr7gqEj3o9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ангел 2","credit_id":"619f2f6c4f9a990098d6d5d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoliy Belyy","original_name":"Анатолий Белый","popularity":0.3551,"profile_path":"/cQupz7e1lPQyAIfFlncdgYQUzXH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Игорь","credit_id":"619f2f731283e90061668118","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktoriya Tolstoganova","original_name":"Виктория Толстоганова","popularity":0.3876,"profile_path":"/8oljgQ3UjdddEvZSozjzLrrw11g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ольга","credit_id":"619f2f7be2ff320026ecead9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radda Novikova","original_name":"Радда Новикова","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122f18fa80236002fd6a80d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1933127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aleksandr Tsypkin","original_name":"Александр Цыпкин","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/cEvJKtQc9PUsWV5kVvpmBrPopGO.jpg","credit_id":"619f2fde15794a0044043192","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2024780,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Vladimir Kuptsov","original_name":"Владимир Купцов","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/l0xVw1tr4c7EfC2tfbX2F2Vrfvo.jpg","credit_id":"619f3004bc2cb30064324da3","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2265930,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mariya Wiemken","original_name":"Mariya Wiemken","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619f300ee2ff320026eceb82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2530524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anzhelika Pashkova","original_name":"Анжелика Пашкова","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619f2fb6d71fb40061fb06f8","department":"Production","job":"General Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324031,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Kim-von Den Driesch","original_name":"Julia Kim-von Den Driesch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619f2fd435db45002c5515a3","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065249,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olga Livinskaya","original_name":"Ольга Ливинская","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619f2fec310325008f5e2bb5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14968524","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1544,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ejW87fQEstwy37OsiRa8BVcBxP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
