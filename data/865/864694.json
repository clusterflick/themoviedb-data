Picking the viewer from the beginning to get introduced to the background story by evolving a continuous raising tension. Ariane's visa gets declined, and even with a 90-day permit to stay, she gets refused to enter New Zealand. Tin is at that time already in Christchurch with a bought camper. They figure the only possible solution is to change the entire plan to South America. After a two-year long-distance relationship, the couple is facing again incredibly difficult situations. Several local confrontations and a broken car strengthens their bond and accelerates the year in the wild into an immersive experience. Passing the small ridge between a nature-travel documentary and a story which lets your blood run cold, White Spot makes you wanna break out of the system and travel the world.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/rbAjTjl5sVYvrgJO7K7Tt2iSYWz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Spot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3209504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tin Brendel","original_name":"Tin Brendel","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61239ca46f53e10046b37ee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3209506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ariane Figueiredo","original_name":"Ariane Figueiredo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61239d446f53e10073b40989","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8742566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1411,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rbAjTjl5sVYvrgJO7K7Tt2iSYWz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
