When few women walked the road alone, she hitchhiked the continent. A poet searching for the lands promised by her childhood books. Over time, she discovered that going somewhere very close could be as intense an adventure as those trips. The secret garden accompanies the poet on the journey that she makes every end of the year, from Buenos Aires to an island in Paraná. There, surrounded by the nature of the delta - in that place where the garden of the house merges with the mountain - is the place where she writes. \"Writing is also a vertigo - she says while, with buckets, she removes the mud left by the flood -. But the beautiful thing is to have the vertigo and the return. Writing pushed me far and out, and brought me back.\"","popularity":0.0885,"poster_path":"/h2qjMzc5iIMq0QvE2USnDHfH8QN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2012-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary about the poet Diana Bellessi","title":"El Jardín Secreto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Bellessi","original_name":"Diana Bellessi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6123b2912dc44e0045c7dd7b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3209572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristián Constantini","original_name":"Cristián Constantini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123b2c1bbcae00045cd3774","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2002907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Panich","original_name":"Diego Panich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123b2d2c439c0005ce36e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Prado","original_name":"Claudia Prado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6123b2e7886348002c535d7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandro Listorti","original_name":"Leandro Listorti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nleOXNPJfJ2Z1AvCJ6yTztgtnF5.jpg","credit_id":"6521a03607216600c56ae298","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandro Listorti","original_name":"Leandro Listorti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nleOXNPJfJ2Z1AvCJ6yTztgtnF5.jpg","credit_id":"65219f4774507d011c11c344","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandro Listorti","original_name":"Leandro Listorti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nleOXNPJfJ2Z1AvCJ6yTztgtnF5.jpg","credit_id":"6521a03c74507d00c57be717","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1086,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/h2qjMzc5iIMq0QvE2USnDHfH8QN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El jardín secreto - documental sobre la poeta Diana Bellessi (completo)","key":"qV3-kFNEV20","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-09-11T03:28:59.000Z","id":"6123b35e0f2fbd00818e98ad"}]}}}
