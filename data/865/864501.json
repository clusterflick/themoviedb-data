It’s difficult to imagine that a man who lived with horse drawn carriages and sailing ships would foresee our massive 21st century global market exchange, much less the relationship between markets and morality. But Adam Smith was no ordinary 18th century figure. Considered the “father of modern economics,” Smith was first and foremost a moral philosopher. The revolutionary ideas he penned in The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, changed the world.  Norberg explores Smith’s insights regarding free trade and the nature of wealth to the present, where they are thriving and driving the world’s economy.","popularity":0.5001,"poster_path":"/aVgJ0zrJ7K8bnUVJwYwL92bpA2Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Adam Smith: Ideas That Changed The World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208563,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Brown","original_name":"Roger Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122d5e2bbcae0002ba1689e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Norberg","original_name":"Johan Norberg","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/oRiTR9JoTTsU01j3MVsu5u8tX51.jpg","credit_id":"6122d631886348007e361a2e","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Taylor","original_name":"Jim Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122d6086f53e10073b2f3f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Skinner","original_name":"Thomas Skinner","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122d61ed6590b002c834cb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Potter","original_name":"Barbara Potter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6122d5f2d2c0c1002c375872","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5591022","wikidata_id":"Q27043728","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVgJ0zrJ7K8bnUVJwYwL92bpA2Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":593,"name":"globalization"},{"id":2304,"name":"market economy"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":3681,"name":"economy"},{"id":10329,"name":"wealth"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":188950,"name":"corporation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
