Their task is to weave the finest robes for the temple’s Buddha images. All robes must be finished by dawn otherwise they are considered ‘stale’. Cheered on by large crowds and an orchestra of pulsating drums and high-pitched oboes, the teams of dedicated female competitors work the handlooms frenziedly back and forth in a feat that celebrates Buddha’s own foster mother, Gautami, who is said to have woven her son a robe in a single day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Million Threads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383443,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thu Thu Shein","original_name":"Thu Thu Shein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61214809d70594005cff2b37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pe Maung Same","original_name":"Pe Maung Same","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121482085c0a20046429965","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383443,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thu Thu Shein","original_name":"Thu Thu Shein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121482a9f0e190073443623","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383443,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thu Thu Shein","original_name":"Thu Thu Shein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612148322e0697005da73374","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3207155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lay Thida","original_name":"Lay Thida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6121483fd70594002ee2cf4d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
