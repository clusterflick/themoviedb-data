Archive photographs from the collection at the Henry Moore Foundation complement the artworks, newly filmed across Britain, in France and the USA. Many of the artist’s most significant sculptures are featured, from the earliest models of the 1920s to the monuments of his final years. Drawings from each stage of his career, including the famous tube shelter sketches made during the Blitz, are also included. The specially recorded soundtrack is drawn solely from Moore’s words in interviews, articles and letters.","popularity":0.1827,"poster_path":"/4hC9kKk4ufJN1ae3roS6yB5B3cc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Henry Moore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wyver","original_name":"John Wyver","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":"/yHuOcIl8fCdfpHJlkEHT85cnssX.jpg","credit_id":"6570b742dcb6a300c7f163bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4416452,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ian Serfontein","original_name":"Ian Serfontein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6570b795dcb6a3011ebd4024","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4416466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Flynn","original_name":"Sam Flynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6570b8744539d00138f13013","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1594979","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQAuxN3F3Ubrf95mvkXzoYo7nzH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4hC9kKk4ufJN1ae3roS6yB5B3cc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
