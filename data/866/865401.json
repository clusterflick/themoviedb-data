Well paid, striding with the big guys, enjoying power in the fame-hungry rock world, Peter lives life on the A Side. But sometimes his spin-master talents clash with his kindred moral code, and he feels a nagging sense of unease. Still, he is the head CYA -- and he likes it on the A Side. And then he meets Nina. She needs a good man to do a dirty job. In a shockingly short time, well-ordered Peter degenerates into an unsavory man compulsively in love and tied-in with the Irish mob. His life in chaos, he crashes onto the B Side. His moment of truth comes in London where he faces a life-threatening decision: redemption or death. Peter maneuvers to once again become the spin-master...but will he survive?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost on the B Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0860452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
