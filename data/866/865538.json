This forced her mother Rita, an overseas Filipino worker in the Middle East, to go on an emergency leave to take care of her only daughter who was severely affected by the incident.  In the following days, strange things start to happen to Mina at home and at school. Her nose bleeds endlessly, a python appears in their home, and she sees the spirits of her ancestors come to their house. A healer, an old woman from the next barrio, is called to treat Mina’s strange afflictions. The old woman surmises that Mina’s ancestors had come to tell her of an important message but Mina is stubborn and continues to ignore the signs communicated.","popularity":0.133,"poster_path":"/Aa7GQaDHbF3wXJSRiFq2pLEEjR9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57619,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Commission for Culture and the Arts","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":159770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Negros Cultural Foundation, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mina's Family History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lean Emgil Galsim","original_name":"Lean Emgil Galsim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6127c9dc1bf8760042133f21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilconida Ambat-Vandoorn","original_name":"Gilconida Ambat-Vandoorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6127c9f332cc2b002a44aa5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Ora","original_name":"Oscar Ora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6127c9fa6c449c002047000d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shiella Paragas","original_name":"Shiella Paragas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6127ca091bf876002a5e4aba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Kaye Lomboy","original_name":"Carole Kaye Lomboy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6127ca1e5ed9620092e6b5d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2951228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua De Guzman","original_name":"Joshua De Guzman","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/qGyMs1eUNY1BNVdJpBUnc5TEdDL.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"","credit_id":"62e38416e25860005fb8a111","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlyn Ora","original_name":"Marlyn Ora","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"6127ca42373ac2002a8c238b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Andrie Santos","original_name":"John Andrie Santos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"6127ca501bf876008b4caef0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay-Em Serapion","original_name":"Jay-Em Serapion","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"6127ca5d957ce5006611569f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Ceralde","original_name":"Noel Ceralde","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"6127ca666c449c0042939aee","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carla Pulido Ocampo","original_name":"Carla Pulido Ocampo","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/jV8YGAtOiDOCmOqnlZptiahR9jo.jpg","credit_id":"61264957ad59b5006137dca7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marvin Agulan","original_name":"Marvin Agulan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612649444e67420044bee1b5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212055,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Adrian Adan","original_name":"Adrian Adan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612649674e67420064ab0c3b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Gozum","original_name":"Christopher Gozum","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hg0wlzJX09uuUsNIyDrX7siUuHy.jpg","credit_id":"61264920fe077a0091aa6704","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Gozum","original_name":"Christopher Gozum","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hg0wlzJX09uuUsNIyDrX7siUuHy.jpg","credit_id":"61264936fdf8b70093e7515d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213207,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marichu G.
