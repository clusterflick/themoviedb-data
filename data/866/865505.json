Though the image produced and edited creates a split-second moment of violence for the viewer's pleasure, Crashing Waves uncovers the months of labor, training, and danger that the stunt involved, contingent on capitalist, patriarchal hierarchies in the film industry. The film meditates on the stakes of the real in the dominant culture's production of images and emphasizes the importance of the ethics of care.","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":"/a8smi1d0aygHi4jSv0FXjq5xRnS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crashing Waves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Kerr","original_name":"Lucy Kerr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612634a10257640029bdfcbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Kerr","original_name":"Lucy Kerr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61af7d63a6c1040041bf6fb1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339305,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kārlis Bergs","original_name":"Kārlis Bergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61af7d7f13af5f00896bff42","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1583701,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jessica Harbeck","original_name":"Jessica Harbeck","popularity":0.1861,"profile_path":"/mFO31DDgcp80E0vbEPC6NWn817Z.jpg","credit_id":"61af7d8fa2423200606be80f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Kerr","original_name":"Lucy Kerr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61af7d5b35c30a0042bd616c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15104626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a8smi1d0aygHi4jSv0FXjq5xRnS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crashing Waves Trailer","key":"505854792","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-28T21:19:30.000Z","id":"61af96a233ad8f0040967f78"}]}}}
