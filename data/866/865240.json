For the first half hour or so it's all heavy melodrama about a guy seeking revenge for his dead father and his mom's disappointment with him for not getting it and generally for being such a loser. When we finally get to some fighting there are some weird choices including one of the end fight scenes being just a series of stills shown over some music.","popularity":0.1142,"poster_path":"/tX1Jcfqcyu6fziGqI2pmihMwMuK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A righteous sad story full of actions","title":"Triumph Of Two Kung-Fu Arts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Fist For A Fist","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Triumph by Two Kung Fu Arts","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Chan Wai-Man","original_name":"陳惠敏","popularity":1.1133,"profile_path":"/xrDFaI9nuOsb6GWzcYsP6QBhnQe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6421d75c6a34480112ba3863","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":581802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hsiu-shen Liang","original_name":"Hsiu-shen Liang","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":"/qIvUlqikJNRmxSuVzEzFdknYe40.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6125392b91745b005c83275f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gua Ah-leh","original_name":"歸亞蕾","popularity":0.66,"profile_path":"/7nkFqpzp6u2uGABRKPNLk5edzbv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61253939c439c000462a2d05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chin Kang","original_name":"金剛","popularity":0.2834,"profile_path":"/2OmJKXgwIjUKnXGn4brjBjabDYF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6125395e91745b007299c8b8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chow Siu-Loi","original_name":"Chow Siu-Loi","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6125396dc439c0005ce57999","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheng-Huan Chung","original_name":"Cheng-Huan Chung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61253997d6590b0045ac1810","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1787745","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2954,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tX1Jcfqcyu6fziGqI2pmihMwMuK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":780,"name":"kung fu"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Triumph by Two Kung Fu Arts (1977) trailer","key":"wiSTD8lUvxM","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-05-18T10:19:30.000Z","id":"61253a213a96500046eecb78"}]}}}
