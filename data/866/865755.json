What's Lomo? In 1991 a group of Viennese students discovered the Lomo Kompakt Automat when on holiday in Prague. This mass-produced Soviet camera was so cheap and easy to use that they shot rolls of film, ignoring the established rules of \"good\" photography. The resulting snaps were often odd to look at, out of focus and, due to the character of the Lomo lens, garishly coloured. But they were wonderfully fresh. The craze for Lomo spread so fast that when, in 1996, the St Petersburg manufacturers threatened to stop making the camera, Lomographers stepped in to guarantee all future sales. Today the Lomographic Society has embassies across the globe with Lomography.com as its base. Hundreds participate in international Lomo events and add to the ever-growing LomoWorldArchive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An insight into the odd world of Lomography and the camera that inspired it.","title":"The LOMO Camera: Shoot From The Hip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Graham","original_name":"Alex Graham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6126ef824cd9120063412564","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212604,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Parkinson","original_name":"Steve Parkinson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6126efa01bf876004211e67a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n2mIlTZHYcRqaz2miMNROaqSKsK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Lomo Camera, Shoot from the Hip TRAILER","key":"124062483","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-03T20:43:37.000Z","id":"6126ef27f29d66008fc016ca"}]}}}
