There, we can find Christine Mengus and Nohra Boukara, specialized in the rights of foreigners, supported by Audrey Scarinoff and their co-workers.. Stories from their sad, appalling or tragicomic cases alternate with their daily legal work. And as we hear snatches of consultations involving illegal entry or departure, deportation orders, the right to reside or medical assistance, we become witnesses to predictable tragedies, to the administrative or social precariousness induced by such predicaments, and to whole lives depending on court rulings.","popularity":0.3103,"poster_path":"/du0basILGpmPq9IfxEPwaUNGLLM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16266,"logo_path":"/4BqNNUJgq1wojHPDgL90oL4LW58.png","name":"Seppia","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sense of Justice","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Sense of Justice","type":"Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391588,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laureline Delom","original_name":"Laureline Delom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61260620fe077a0066ef0df7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Swen de Pauw","original_name":"Swen de Pauw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6126044b944a5700989365ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211827,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hervé Roesch","original_name":"Hervé Roesch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612605fde04d8a00430b617b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1944842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Sadoux","original_name":"Martin Sadoux","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6126064d4e6742002a074b68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cédric Bonin","original_name":"Cédric Bonin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61260688d7059400957ccab6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15100932","wikidata_id":"Q116664804","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yimRvGUnwCK2LRwl07IjiFAdlVG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/du0basILGpmPq9IfxEPwaUNGLLM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3640,"name":"work"},{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":972,"name":"refugee"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":15108,"name":"justice"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"FID Marseille","release_date":"2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
