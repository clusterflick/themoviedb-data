Children. And their mother. The lapping waves, the sound of crickets, the fire and the bottom of a swimming pool-turned-pond, and a giant shell which brings back memories. In just a few shots, Grégoire Perrier sketches a delicate path leading to Basile and Hortense, brother and sister in their early years, on the brink of language, its emergence, and its invention. He registers the epiphenomena that punctuate their daily lives and offers us vignettes of a childhood that radiates before our eyes, in all its anger, its games, its demands.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":159902,"logo_path":"/tabGqPBoN9t7tdUKBUrM5FbjzNS.png","name":"Cellulo Prod","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Lily Split","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grégoire Perrier","original_name":"Grégoire Perrier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a7c102c6b7b00626efaa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grégoire Perrier","original_name":"Grégoire Perrier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a7c1de04aca00234d063e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grégoire Perrier","original_name":"Grégoire Perrier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a7c2312197e002a673a17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2940045,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emmanuelle Gachet","original_name":"Emmanuelle Gachet","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a7c2d42f19f0095789ee1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215264,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gloria Jacobsen","original_name":"Gloria Jacobsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a7c3706f984008eb6a8c5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15056740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseille","release_date":"2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
