As the ship docks, the two couples stand ready like drooling dogs about to chow down. However, the four are in for a sore disappointment: the gifts brought along by their uncle turn out to be very modest in scope. Enraged, the Sørensens destroy their gifts and mock the uncle by throwing cream puffs at his portrait in their living room. Mr Madsen wastes no time in getting rid of the cheap pearl necklace his wife has received. But the necklace keeps coming back in mysterious ways – which proves very fortuitous for them.
