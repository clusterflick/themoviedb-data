But the practice is fraught with complex implications for women, children, and families. What is the impact on the women who serve as surrogates and on the children who are born from surrogacy? In what ways might money complicate things? What about altruistic surrogacy done for a family member or close friend? Is surrogacy a beautiful, loving act or does it simply degrade pregnancy to a service and a baby to a product? Can we find a middle ground? Should we even look for one?  From The Center for Bioethics and Culture, producers of the award-winning Eggsploitation (2010, 2013), and Anonymous Father’s Day (2011), Breeders: A Subclass of Women? explores this important issue, talking with surrogates, physicians, psychologists, and activists across the political and ideological spectrum.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/sWI2vCKkeGjN9zxxW41kkoOZq0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breeders: A Subclass of Women","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4304700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Eppinette","original_name":"Matthew Eppinette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651cda4a65c26c010158270b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Lahl","original_name":"Jennifer Lahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651cda5507216600e2d7cbfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3524188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sWI2vCKkeGjN9zxxW41kkoOZq0O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
