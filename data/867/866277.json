Personal family photographs from his father’s funeral are overlaid with the imagined voice by the artist himself, fictionalising that his dead father is coming back to life—a strange and moving feedback loop between father and son, between photographic documentation and deteriorating memories, between personal history and its own otherness.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/yVsXSB9QKLIfEk4CfKqoKZizMmo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tulapop Saenjaroen","original_name":"Tulapop Saenjaroen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/akfgjmkxJ5Jpr6nb6Ext2KspTQH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6128de091bf8760062265f37","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tulapop Saenjaroen","original_name":"Tulapop Saenjaroen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/akfgjmkxJ5Jpr6nb6Ext2KspTQH.jpg","credit_id":"6128de24e8a3e1008cf7ae9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yVsXSB9QKLIfEk4CfKqoKZizMmo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
