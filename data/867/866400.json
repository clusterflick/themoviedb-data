Their insightful and provocative responses provide the central theme of the film, a half-hour examination of how the media presents girls. Juxtaposing footage culled from a typical week of TV broadcasting with original interviews, WHAT A GIRL WANTS will provoke debate and, ideally, act as a catalyst for change in media content.","popularity":0.1589,"poster_path":"/w7YnfnuRAL1EMtoOi8ywhIHeyzj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159860,"logo_path":null,"name":"CHC Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the spring of 2000, eleven girls and two classrooms of students were interviewed about the impact of media culture on their lives.
