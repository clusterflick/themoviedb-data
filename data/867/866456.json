When they are discovered, they seek refuge in a Chinese gazebo used by the vagabonds Pat and Patachon as a cheap summer residence. However, the two vagabonds quickly vacate the premises to let the young couple stay there. As a thank you, Hans, who is a sailor, enrols Long and Short as part of the crew on his rich uncle’s boat and invites the entire girls’ institute and its headmistress on a sailing trip. In disguise, Hans hopes to spend some time with Elinor, but once again they fail to deceive the headmistress. Long and Short now come upon the idea of hiring a brickworks, whose owner turns out to be Elinor’s uncle. But mysterious things happen at the factory, which does not make entirely ordinary bricks, and Long and Short find themselves caught up in yet another heady drama.
