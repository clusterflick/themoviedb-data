Jacinto amuses himself playing with his pig or in the surrounding chestnut forests building a fantasy world where he reigns supreme. He is also keen on watching vampire movies.  When a couple of young girls arrive to take residence at an abandoned house in the village belonging to one of their deceased relatives to record new songs for their heavy metal band, Jacinto becomes convinced that they are vampires.  Their worlds could not be more far apart. Just like in the movies Jacinto has to come up with a plan to make the newcomers disappear, and bring peace back to his enchanted life again.","popularity":0.0937,"poster_path":"/jfsTscC6EUHmE2ies6kwqUF4LlV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vizuals
