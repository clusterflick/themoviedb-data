In this peaceful rural setting, the pupils could learn, play and thrive out in the fresh air, and in this delightful colour film we see them follow a routine of lessons and religious observance, as well as painting, sport and gardening, and exploring the pine forest around the school. The original school closed in 2010.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/dvqWlEDFXhpAlXtD8S7U9wvge2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumn In Delamere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dvqWlEDFXhpAlXtD8S7U9wvge2c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
