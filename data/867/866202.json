Bears and wolves still roam its inaccessible forests, in its remote villages people still live in harmony with nature - many things appear as in times long past for us. Romania is still home to animals and traditions that have long been lost in other regions: marmots inhabit the high meadows of the Carpathian Mountains, where shepherds graze their sheep in summer. Colorful bee-eaters live in Transylvania and pelicans fish in the Black Sea. With impressive images, this high-quality nature documentation takes you to surprisingly unknown, wild Romania.","popularity":0.0961,"poster_path":"/kRvGGcIjMW3YUKMEpjD1rbcRKBm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR Naturfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Romania - Land of Bears and Wolves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213806,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephan Canham","original_name":"Stephan Canham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128a366dff66e00641cbd0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Willers","original_name":"Thomas Willers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128a3560d9f5a0089f94755","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213807,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Markus Joggerst","original_name":"Markus Joggerst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128a37455c926002a24cc82","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Willers","original_name":"Thomas Willers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128a33174d6c0004385201a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Willers","original_name":"Thomas Willers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128a3498d1b8e008da42c31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kRvGGcIjMW3YUKMEpjD1rbcRKBm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
