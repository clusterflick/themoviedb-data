He calls Amy Pond on the TARDIS phone to ask her to rescue him, but realises she can't fly the TARDIS, he doesn't have the co-ordinates to give her and she left the TARDIS long ago. The Doctor admits he just wanted to chat, says \"Merry Christmas, Amelia\", and releases the button. The ship explodes.","popularity":0.4692,"poster_path":"/zeNI7IMBxIDGJxJH8GcGb8WL644.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor Who: The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe Prequel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Smith","original_name":"Matt Smith","popularity":1.7531,"profile_path":"/b3AYe7kkImkB35CoYwlUqHnJGF8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"65590319d4fe0400e1b4bc70","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Moffat","original_name":"Steven Moffat","popularity":0.5203,"profile_path":"/fjW3laJlDnHxQbuj9LLc6EYEDy.jpg","credit_id":"6559037253866e00c5b3784d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farren Blackburn","original_name":"Farren Blackburn","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/dH7d5MvwaXmtbV9HyS3NjK9TC7b.jpg","credit_id":"655903880816c70137ea84d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qGIbjnj4t7r1GWuqglIdX8Mm2Zq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zeNI7IMBxIDGJxJH8GcGb8WL644.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":853},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rtCZgk6viVS39MhztSpgORNP8xC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mBfTgWtKhdwBfDcYigXTE2q27K7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
