A series of black and white video feeds from security cameras reveal the place to be Area 52. The last shot is of an apparently empty specimen tank. Two soldiers, each wearing an eyepatch, make their way down a corridor, stopping next to a pair of empty tanks nestled into alcoves along the wall. The soldiers check the tanks, report them as secured, then move on. After the soldiers leave, a Silent appears in each tank, alive and awake. Footage from security cameras throughout the base reveal there are at least one hundred and twelve identical tanks, with the implication that all of them contain Silents. Behind a barricaded wooden door in another room containing an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus, a woman in a black suit stands with her back turned to the camera. As the camera zooms in, she turns. It is River Song, with an eyepatch over her right eye. She smiles.","popularity":0.3974,"poster_path":"/cocBF8kfqctqJBuoH4YqCUtlAba.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor Who: The Wedding of River Song Prequel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Kingston","original_name":"Alex Kingston","popularity":1.4383,"profile_path":"/pBK1qMZEFkRAFcfdLb7Z28f6qd2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"River Song","credit_id":"655901f1d4fe04011b92ecc6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Moffat","original_name":"Steven Moffat","popularity":0.5203,"profile_path":"/fjW3laJlDnHxQbuj9LLc6EYEDy.jpg","credit_id":"65590202ca0e17013a1d4413","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":175311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Webb","original_name":"Jeremy Webb","popularity":0.2482,"profile_path":"/hJcVQ62yQTBP5lLbhsIFpeHK2hD.jpg","credit_id":"65590223b5400214d3cad7d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zu9OGKMb89yW7a3nuGLs4Fe4J9E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1890,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cocBF8kfqctqJBuoH4YqCUtlAba.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1260},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mOjP68EBBFesTrIwg5FN2BIi4O3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omNr3rmM8dBAssFwnJbz78mJN5T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
