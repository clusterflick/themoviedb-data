The earthquake caused 3 million people to be affected and over 9000 people died. Japanese photographer Ishikawa Fan flew to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal at the first time, and came to the dangerous zone located in the the Himalayas near the epicenter. In that deserted area, the breathtaking beauty of Laprak village has turned into ruins. The villagers who suffered from the face to face disaster persevered in their survival, bidding farewell to the deceased and moving forward towards a confused future. In this process, there is a collision between government and faith. Is it for survival?
