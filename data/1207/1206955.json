The story unfolds in the beautiful summer of 1994, when a retired art history professor, Lorenzo, moves to a tiny town near Syracuse, NY. where he meets Luke, an unexpected young towner who just buried his father. The hidden truths stir up changes in everything. Things start shifting before neither realizes it.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/woDgWWi0cbbQ4AN2SBiadYtHQlq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wait, Lorenzo!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Carrigan","original_name":"Christian Carrigan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"655909c127db610100038b0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2368435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Lu Yu","original_name":"Louis Lu Yu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p3keEsBRQkSoe5x3rfWTyBmbMae.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"655909e9d4fe04011b92eeb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Troy Tripicchio","original_name":"Troy Tripicchio","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"655909f57f054018d516915e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ran Shan","original_name":"Ran Shan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655909b5b5400214d27cb185","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shukai Wang","original_name":"Shukai Wang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655909a8d4fe0400ac37f430","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14273046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/woDgWWi0cbbQ4AN2SBiadYtHQlq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
