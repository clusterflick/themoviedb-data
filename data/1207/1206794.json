With them, the choreographer explores contemporary rituals and the founding myths that shape our collective imagination. With music composed by Thomas Bangalter, ex-Daft Punk, and performed by the Orchestre de chambre de Paris under the direction of Romain Dumas, this powerful, evocative work explores what lurks in the recesses of our existence, through our ideals and beliefs, bringing ancient mythologies into dialogue with those of our own time.","popularity":0.1627,"poster_path":"/7rnjLNj74GCghU6olW69OAwEFad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Our contemporary rituals and their mythological roots","title":"Mythologies","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelin Preljocaj","original_name":"Angelin Preljocaj","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/hA68MYZ5GOBOsUcHbYKG2Y4V54J.jpg","credit_id":"6558b83e22931a011c96c0b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Bangalter","original_name":"Thomas Bangalter","popularity":0.4303,"profile_path":"/w961KKic96EBX5gGHMEjahfKuDI.jpg","credit_id":"67c8fc43fb4402dce1033208","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30743365","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0SSaEtpgh4DbeLtCOeHOhhiXwQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":9.117,"height":377,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/w4EeOvLs9kAMScScjHmxB6XZ4sj.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3437}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1352,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7rnjLNj74GCghU6olW69OAwEFad.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tIUwVr3ND4nNDPVLaPrGHy21b6g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
