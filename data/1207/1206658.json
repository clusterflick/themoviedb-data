While walking along Hadrian's Wall, wounded traveller Sian hitches a lift from two men from the circus. She agrees to join their act but still seeks vengeance on her nemesis in nearby Seahouses. England's North East is bleak yet romantic in Ian Dodd's wonderfully dark comedy-drama.","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":"/mXfUNXlMRO1PCKxRCcgffCFlXLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seahouses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"zoe heyes","original_name":"zoe heyes","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"655835b30816c700fd318ef2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"andrew callway","original_name":"andrew callway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"655835bf7f054018d342820b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"chad 'ned' kelly","original_name":"chad 'ned' kelly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"655835dcd051d9010085aee3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351052,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ian Dodds","original_name":"Ian Dodds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655836180816c700e01aa9da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxyAZi5KXbAPD8Hs55QCXQMc974.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mXfUNXlMRO1PCKxRCcgffCFlXLR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
