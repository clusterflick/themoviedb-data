The footage draws me to reminisce about snippets of my everyday life. I contemplate how we perceive the world through analog optical apparatuses and how memories are multidimensional yet fragile. Our recollections of people and places can be distorted, unrecognizable, and fictitious. These memories would eventually diminish with the passing of time. Everything Comes Full Circle is a personal attempt to remember things that will soon be forgotten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z6FIbnb2FHg48XWH43hDGyiLjR7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Comes Full Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lilan Yang","original_name":"Lilan Yang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6557779bea84c71096de374b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julian Tran","original_name":"Julian Tran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6640c8ec34c7a6f03959a45a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z6FIbnb2FHg48XWH43hDGyiLjR7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8z28n7nezfg5MeCjNzMub5te7F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
