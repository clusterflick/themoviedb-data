There's tension in the air as Tanya tries to get close to Ron, though Ron reads her affection as being clingy. When Ron returns home from work that evening, Tanya tries to please him with a romantic dinner. However, instead of making things steamy between them, Ron only becomes puzzled and uncomfortable. Finally, Tanya snaps. Claire (Arietta Adams) is surprised when her stepfather Gavin (Ryan Driller) comes home early from a gala where he was given an award. Not only is he home early, but his wife Tara (Audrey Madison) is nowhere to be seen. Gavin glumly recounts how Tara ruined the entire evening, making such a stink that he decided to leave out of sheer embarrassment. Suddenly, Claire seems to get an idea. Why don't they celebrate all of Gavin's achievements together? Both of them grow progressively more aroused.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o64M7rUugvH1J5wfPhxMavGquPj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/p4SuncmnR1bxoA6GNVEA4tQIn4y.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2281759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arietta Adams","original_name":"Arietta Adams","popularity":21.905,"profile_path":"/eVujRqkZk7Ccc6fuYrNCcFO0CUH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65571b02ea84c710910cb1e5","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3043257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Kitt","original_name":"Nicole Kitt","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/1tz0wFX2jLXxh9LPxfLi9yvEkeA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65571b0bd051d90100853ed7","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1809120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donny Sins","original_name":"Donny Sins","popularity":2.095,"profile_path":"/kEVG5fuCRz5vostI9GQ6MA9S2ye.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65571b13ea84c7109228932a","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1110060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Driller","original_name":"Ryan Driller","popularity":11.875,"profile_path":"/9InfuI0jH2vyUiLcAxiCb5wtyCW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65571b1aea84c710959e630b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1647480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bree Mills","original_name":"Bree Mills","popularity":2.24,"profile_path":"/ql5DBazbVozMqktpcFv7aby2I0F.jpg","credit_id":"65571b2fea84c7109228933c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22080310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o64M7rUugvH1J5wfPhxMavGquPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
