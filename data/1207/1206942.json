Since they were kids, they laughed, cried, and dealt with everything that life threw their way side-by-side. Their teen years were no different, and they continued to flourish even as they added a new friend to their numbers. However, as High School finally draws to a close, Jamie finds herself dealing with some unprecedented and dangerous feelings for her best friend. When an old bully returns to shake things up further, Jamie becomes isolated into her emotions, and Olive doesn't know if she can put up with it for much longer.","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":"/tJtqFbFtJ19AnVz7EdnsA35EecR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absence of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Owens","original_name":"Grace Owens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"655902e853866e00e2948bf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paige Hughes","original_name":"Paige Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6559030627db6100c6e5a1ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Tanger","original_name":"Ben Tanger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"655902eeb5400214d06fbdb0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colton Lanham","original_name":"Colton Lanham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6559030cea84c71096dedf7c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tessa Morell","original_name":"Tessa Morell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559025a7f054018d41fc79a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tessa Morell","original_name":"Tessa Morell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6559026022931a00ac65582e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28428725","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tJtqFbFtJ19AnVz7EdnsA35EecR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
