Dorium has extracted it from the memory of a Judoon trooper, admitting he decided that it was quicker to take the whole brain. He gives them the brain in exchange for a bag of sentient money. Dorium doesn't understand why they are doing all this to imprison one child, and says he's heard rumours about whose child they've taken. He asks if they are mad and if they've heard the stories about the Doctor. Dorium warns them \"God help us if you've made him angry\".","popularity":0.2375,"poster_path":"/4Q7PpRMKtwIiaqQGaee4lY3J1cT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor Who: A Good Man Goes To War Prequel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Fisher-Becker","original_name":"Simon Fisher-Becker","popularity":0.1547,"profile_path":"/wt7FOsSF0DDIkQnsiyQbb9G75QG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dorium","credit_id":"6558f19aca0e1700adbf9ad9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Laurini","original_name":"Claudio Laurini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Headless Monk","credit_id":"6558f1b553866e00c5b3733b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hoar","original_name":"Peter Hoar","popularity":0.2004,"profile_path":"/qfLft2v4stmVdXYEdanJhasYC5J.jpg","credit_id":"6558f1ced4fe0400ac37ee00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Moffat","original_name":"Steven Moffat","popularity":0.5203,"profile_path":"/fjW3laJlDnHxQbuj9LLc6EYEDy.jpg","credit_id":"6558f1d9b5400214cf39f094","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1187,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Q7PpRMKtwIiaqQGaee4lY3J1cT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":791},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1187,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nt8BjdUkJqLJQzynsdSvR5QXyrN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":791},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1ccjxlVQXcEW7pHi7liieAUNLi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
