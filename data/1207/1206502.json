It placed him under plenty of pressure as the field headed away from Buenos Aires. Kenneth Eriksson and Erwin Weber had Volkswagen Golf GTi cars to call upon, Argentinian Jorge Recalde could be expected to go well in a Lancia Delta, while Ingvar Carlsson's Mazda 323 4WD was back after modifications including improved cooling and the introduction of variable central differential gear. Fast and spectacular, the cameras caught plenty of entertaining action on the route to Cordoba.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jAiZq70QsEsT5w4oSVQxmhNby0C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rally Argentina 1987","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x0P0RQMJqrq7NWb0Az6KD8QV2Hx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":883,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAiZq70QsEsT5w4oSVQxmhNby0C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
