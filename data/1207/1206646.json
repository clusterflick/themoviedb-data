Despite becoming friends and after having agreed to being filmed from the outset, Sory turns away Marie's camera from the hair salon when her son migrates illegally to Spain. Marie returns to her country and turns the camera toward Lisset, Sory's daughter. Lisset has to decide whether to move to Barcelona with her mother or to stay in Santo Domingo with her children. Amid flags and polarized societies, Marie exposes a family divided by frontiers more complex than those set up by the water that surrounds the island.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xGdxtOmkX5iIGDvJvbYglGVK0aE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D'Sory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soraya Suero","original_name":"Soraya Suero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65582ae3d051d9013a17fbf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisset Suero","original_name":"Lisset Suero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65582aeab5400214d11723b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Suero","original_name":"Emmanuel Suero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65582af3ca0e1700adbf3fc8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4383206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Jiménez","original_name":"Marie Jiménez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65582b4bb5400214d27c4def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4383206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Jiménez","original_name":"Marie Jiménez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65582b66d051d9010085a97e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8055098","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/xGdxtOmkX5iIGDvJvbYglGVK0aE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
