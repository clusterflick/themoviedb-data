Camels come and go frequently. Men generally wear long tunics and flowing traditional headdresses that protect them from the sun. Women and children are very shy in front of the camera at first, but soon enjoy showing how they balance large water jugs and bundles on their heads, even while carrying a baby. Most tents appear to be in poor condition and there are long lines for virtually everything, from milk to grain to classrooms. In Nuseirat, school takes place in very crowded tents, with girls and boys learning separately.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aQN6GuWsunE6WAdpHgm1i5g2ZEt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palestine, 1949","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQN6GuWsunE6WAdpHgm1i5g2ZEt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":951}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
