Only three European crews made the long trip - Jimmy McRae (Ford XR4), Simon Stubbings (Nissan 323) and Se pages Heider (Opel Kadett GS1). The Australiasian aces gave their all at this combined tarmac/forest stage rally but ultimately they had little hope of catching Austrian Heider despite valiant efforts from Ray Wilson (Nissan 323 Turbo). The slippery conditions caught out many competitors, the quagmire bordering most stages causing havoc, when even the best service crews took an hour to rescue cars which strayed but a few feet from their chosen course! All in all, an action-packed review of this round of the 1988 Drivers' World Rally Championship.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/nSRGSXi9zQaDzPBJ4iessBI54f2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Zealand Rally 1988","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gqYfFlUwm6vTDxz84hVYpZ4dNXy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nSRGSXi9zQaDzPBJ4iessBI54f2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
