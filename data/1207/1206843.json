Local hero Recaldo with co-driver Jorge del Buono, led the field in one of the Lancia Delta Integrales but despite a flying start chose the wrong tyres. The challenge from Mikael Ericsson, Fiorio, Soto and Fischer led to some exciting duels and traumatic events which quickly whittled down the number of competitors. Only 33 crews completed the gruelling course out of the 77 starters. A memorable event faithfully recorded here for your enjoyment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/42qjtzOaaqTVe2IGgApdnQZAFRB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rally Argentina 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rTTix8bLwJGKNg4kQTG3sZALmSk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42qjtzOaaqTVe2IGgApdnQZAFRB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
