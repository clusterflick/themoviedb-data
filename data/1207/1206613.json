It witnessed the entire 20th century in Portugal: born shortly before the regicide, it grew alongside the young Republic, resisted 40 years of dictatorship, celebrated the April 25th Revolution, and witnessed Portugal's entry into the European Economic Community. It survived censorship, experienced various revolutions, and technological changes, but succumbed to the lack of audience, even at the turn of the 21st century. Two decades later, Batalha is undergoing renovations and will reopen its doors in 2021. Will it be ready to face the challenges of the 21st century?","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/jXxcyI3buNw8HV0TscEYjyH1EZ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vai no Batalha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Alves Costa","original_name":"Alexandre Alves Costa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65580db30816c70137ea1815","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarida Neves","original_name":"Margarida Neves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65580dc4b5400214d06f3d0b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Lino","original_name":"Pedro Lino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65580d4553866e0139e34894","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1164,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/jXxcyI3buNw8HV0TscEYjyH1EZ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":776}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
