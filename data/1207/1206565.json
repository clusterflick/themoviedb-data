But he is not as alone as it seems. A stray dog has already taken up residence in the cabin and despite being incredibly cautious of the new owner, he shows no intention of leaving. Despite his aversion towards caring for anything ever again, Virendra wins the dog's trust and loyalty, eventually naming him after a major source of his deepest heartbreak - Jesus. Even through the long, cold nights of unceasing nightmares, Jesus stays with him. He observes the strange behavior of his newest neighbors - a lesbian couple, Dolly and Sanjana - that seems strangely familiar - but steers clear of them at all costs. Jesus however, takes a keen interest in them and doesn't come home one night.","popularity":0.1376,"poster_path":"/9WjI35C2gjVOPozp1C9umU006Gx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What
