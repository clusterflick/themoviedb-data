To recreate this message, I developed a new surreal style that combines live action with animation, building a realm that blurs the boundaries between reality and dreams.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":141073,"logo_path":null,"name":"M+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snails in a Telephone Booth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1674433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedwig Tam","original_name":"談善言","popularity":0.4002,"profile_path":"/ynHaIWDDZ9saWz7xC7QG78XUCEJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6556dd0d7f054000c579491c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3297497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Step C.","original_name":"Step C.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n36Lf23zNOTol5rXVdhkIoDUjVp.jpg","credit_id":"65df4a8c4d23dd017fa06f4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3786687,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Cong","original_name":"Olivier Cong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0262aa806730184a8ac17","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
