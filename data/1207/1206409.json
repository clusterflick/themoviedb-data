In most of these countries, unchecked transphobia severely limits trans people’s access to education, employment, housing, and medical services. In Mexico, which has one of the highest murder rates of transwomen in the world, the prosecution of these crimes is regrettably uncommon. But despite these challenges, many transwomen live empowered lives; they live in truth and have found respect, acceptance, love, and fulfilling careers. Based on true stories –written and recounted by the protagonists themselves – “TransMexico” is built around the incredible lives of three such transwomen.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/2bio9PGZnDvwLg6dKx1bt4zk556.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three women, one city.
