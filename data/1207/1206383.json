The show was naturally a momentary scandal and the score soon disappeared. In 1991 Gerard McBurney reconstructed from the surviving sketches a sequence of 21 of the orchestral numbers to make a hilarious sequence of gallops, saucy polkas, marches and schmoozy waltzes.","popularity":0.1419,"poster_path":"/aUtTwFjvoTwXViSQPWuNysK7uVk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172374,"logo_path":"/4CZ2vZUMkv4SejlJiC45AwlKbFy.png","name":"Perm Opera and Ballet
