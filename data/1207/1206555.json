He resides at one part of an edifice which was probably built by his grandfather or greatgrandfather. His uncle resides at the other end of the building. He lost his parents long ago. His only sibling Jaga is mentally unsound. He has taken refuge at a street footpath. Hence the balcony, the courtyard yard, the staircase, the rooms and the roof constitute the empire of Rajaditya alone. He builds a Museum of Broken Relationships in his house. The museum becomes home to objects with varying histories ranging from the Partition, religion, citizenship and murder. His Uncle's vision of smashing the old property and selling it off to real-estate buyers confronts Rajaditya with choices between dreams and reality. There is a bridge between them. Would he reconcile with his uncle? Or submit to death","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Museum of Relationships","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bratya Basu","original_name":"Bratya Basu","popularity":0.1817,"profile_path":"/aBv6TqVg0C75kaoHoE71nW4WdB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6557de9dea84c71094016f8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1788919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanchan Mullick","original_name":"Kanchan Mullick","popularity":0.2385,"profile_path":"/rTYLhBRVbxnxTaHogKxYrUZ1kQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6557deb053866e00c5b2e133","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1280894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Supriyo Dutta","original_name":"Supriyo Dutta","popularity":0.1802,"profile_path":"/e5pQ2fPQWcFJLaPXSvWTMatuBoQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6557dec0d4fe0400c42335c1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2190927,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anirban Maity","original_name":"Anirban Maity","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6557df03d4fe0400c42335d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4382724,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jayshree Roy","original_name":"Jayshree Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6557df2053866e00e2940054","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biplab Bandyopadhyay","original_name":"Biplab Bandyopadhyay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6557deead4fe0401398300ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4382726,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pratip Mukherjee","original_name":"Pratip Mukherjee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6557df7f53866e0139e32bf0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
