When the treasure is acquired by the person it is destined for, no trouble arises. However, if someone other than the chosen or destined individual claims the buried treasure, it brings forth bad omens. The film explores the lives of two cousins and the choices they make, highlighting the conflict between greed and need, as well as the themes of prophecy and destiny.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baasan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4381221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jitank Singh Gurjar","original_name":"Jitank Singh Gurjar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6556aa8c53866e00ff078395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29712522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
