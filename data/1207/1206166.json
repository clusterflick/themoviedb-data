The film is an ode to the king who through his military genius took on the might of the Mughals and freed his land from their tyrannical rule of more than 350 years. And yet, history remembers him as much for his heroism as it does for his sense of justice and equality for his subjects, irrespective of class or religion.","popularity":0.2091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prabho Shivaji Raja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4381153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nilesh Muley","original_name":"Nilesh Muley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65569c2967b61345ce38c3fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
