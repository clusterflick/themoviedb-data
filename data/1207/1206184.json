Constructed by engineer Chandranath Barua, this house has been home to some of Assam’s most famous icons, such as filmmaker-actor-musician Brajen Barua, filmmaker-footballer-flautist-painter Nip Barua, singer-turned-composer Ramen Barua, filmmaker Dibon Barua, cricketer-turned-singer Dwipen Barua, cricketer-pilot-entrepreneur-politician Girin Barua and radio broadcaster Niren Barua. The Baruas are surely the only family in Assam, and perhaps in the entire India, that have produced so many noted personalities in fields as diverse as cinema, music, sports and politics. This is the story of ‘The House of Baruas’, reconstructed through memories, archival film clips and photographs. A house that is now facing an uncertain future.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bgBBumyPImHMg32JltPRxlrgvxC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House of Baruas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Baruar Xongxar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Utpal Borpujari","original_name":"Utpal Borpujari","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6556ab4aeea34d013a73000f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29712622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":889,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgBBumyPImHMg32JltPRxlrgvxC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":604}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Indian FIlm Festival","release_date":"2024-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
