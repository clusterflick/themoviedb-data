Her boyfriend Jake has been a best friend to Lucy since they were five years old. Even though she cares dearly for Jake, deep down she knows that there is something missing and that she loves him in a different way. During the summer, Lucy meets Hope, who is spontaneous and full of life. Hope lost both of her parents as a child and grew up in foster care. Despite her rough upbringing, Hope is a very positive character and unlike Lucy, she knows exactly who she is. Hope, who is a lesbian, is proud of who she is and never lets any unwanted judgment affect her. The two immediately form a friendship and as the summer continues that friendship turns into love. Lucy learns many things that summer but most importantly, she learns what it means to be herself and what it means to be happy.","popularity":0.2315,"poster_path":"/aqIDhMfnNMLRL1ugEzP7QYqqr4o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Cameron","original_name":"Anna Cameron","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65584815ea84c71093021468","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catie Carlton","original_name":"Catie Carlton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6558481b53866e011c08d894","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1683881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian C.
