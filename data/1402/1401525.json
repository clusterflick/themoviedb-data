When the judge also suffers reverses, he enters Satan in the Dixie Stakes where the unscrupulous Silas Morgan tries trickery to prevent the colt from running. He almost succeeds until a mysterious rider comes to the barrier, and rides Satan to victory. When Mrs. Fairfax hastens to the paddock, she finds Joyce very muddy and soiled in her jockey colors, just then Judge Boyce arrives, and the trio are reunited.","popularity":0.1344,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dixie Winner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Maupain","original_name":"Ernest Maupain","popularity":0.377,"profile_path":"/d05SUskH3PDsQpy20rDtcCic2qN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Judge Boyce","credit_id":"675be16570f3679278fc425a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3457798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Calhoun","original_name":"Patrick Calhoun","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/oPDcY0RFbhJIX6dAPj7enWPuMq8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Silas Morgan - Banker","credit_id":"675be17f70f3679278fc427a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1980565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Fair","original_name":"Joyce Fair","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/vVLcq85ghmFszfP0qpsLCkfVmL9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joyce Fairfax","credit_id":"675be191c27f1565f579e297","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Murray","original_name":"Marian Murray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Joyce's Mother","credit_id":"675be1a0c27f1565f579e29e","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0441219","wikidata_id":"Q15061811","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
