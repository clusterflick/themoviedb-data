It is based on Les contes fantastiques d’Hoffmann, a play by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, who were inspired by some of the stories of the German E.T.A. Hoffmann. On a drunken night in the city, Hoffmann tells how he courted and lost three girls, his impossible loves: Olympia, a mechanical doll that only he believes to be truly human; Giulietta, the courtesan who steals his reflection in a mirror; and Antonia, a young woman who sings until she literally dies.\"\r Venue & Opera Company: Teatro Regio di Parma  Recorded: 1988\r Singers: Alredo Kraus, Ruth Welting, Jonathan Omilian, Barbara Hendricks, Elena Zilio, Nicola Gjiuselev, Bruno Buulgarelli, Francis Egerton, Aldo Bottion\r Orchestra: Orchestra Sinfonica dell'Emilia-Romagna \"Arturo Toscanini\"  Chorus: Coro del Teatro Regio di Parma  Chorus Master: Adolfo Tanhzi  Stage Director: Beppe de Tomasi","popularity":0.4717,"poster_path":"/g1e4fJ4h0qXbYU4TaxCjxWBuZAT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tales of Hoffmann - Teatro Regio di Parma, 1988","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Kraus","original_name":"Alfredo Kraus","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":"/exG0YwOLT4Vu3rKmDxNrwwEOfPh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hoffmann","credit_id":"675bc3667f927d934f00d12f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":995743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Hendricks","original_name":"Barbara Hendricks","popularity":0.3475,"profile_path":"/kYxkW9rGbw1byjWIEtIgqNVWd0S.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Antonia","credit_id":"675bc3acc27f1565f579dd49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolai Ghiuselev","original_name":"Nicolai Ghiuselev","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/qSCPFrJbT54nqPjMNeznWKzcqh7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The four villains","credit_id":"675bc3dbb65c1a19cb9648cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Zilio","original_name":"Elena Zilio","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/8Ex5ChCsiRxtFXqpUjIgZkDX6Tk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"675bc40bf1bf7a60dff9c62e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Egerton","original_name":"Francis Egerton","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vnN7GSYSSyzRYzMBppe0aQqxvCn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"675bc422b65c1a19cb9648fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Bottion","original_name":"Aldo Bottion","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/2SlHIRCcQ2ZpOT0L9O3PTrcbwix.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"675bc42bf1bf7a60dff9c632","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Offenbach","original_name":"Jacques Offenbach","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/iVnjK1OhWwrkptwNCgPfZTDTyyi.jpg","credit_id":"675bc4f1f932dc771626d07e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Offenbach","original_name":"Jacques Offenbach","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/iVnjK1OhWwrkptwNCgPfZTDTyyi.jpg","credit_id":"675bc50a369ac03099eb0887","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Barbier","original_name":"Jules Barbier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zhVqhaYv2vyzWFHZCuno5iDZPHz.jpg","credit_id":"675bc522ab17a5e30487b139","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629229,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beppe de Tomasi","original_name":"Beppe de Tomasi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vmUMbWy0Y6dclvaR7yExBdFQjsl.jpg","credit_id":"675bc53d6a8003b63bb793e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwC79iLNEO67MvaYxUUBa5AuUaw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2278}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1497,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g1e4fJ4h0qXbYU4TaxCjxWBuZAT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":924,"name":"italian"},{"id":10610,"name":"live"},{"id":215505,"name":"filmed opera"},{"id":222119,"name":"opera live performance"},{"id":230318,"name":"live theatre"},{"id":284103,"name":"theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1988-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
