They are ordinary citizens who had never considered emigration. They do not belong to the famous avant-garde resistance but are still committed to an open and democratic civil society. In the last six months, 500,000 Russians are said to have left Russia. They are threatened not by tanks or missiles, but by the regime's ever-increasing repression, which hits any criticism of the war and any form of civic activism. Forced to leave their homeland by Putin's war, they live as digital dissidents searching for a new home.","popularity":0.1377,"poster_path":"/aHS4MveAVKepWCklPmxFOyii6yT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97382,"logo_path":null,"name":"DokLab GMBH","origin_country":""},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2024-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","title":"Dom (Zuhause auf Russisch)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","title":"Dom (Maison en russe)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Rodina","original_name":"Svetlana Rodina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b74d02718ba3a943e4fc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Rodina","original_name":"Svetlana Rodina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b74dc2b8703bd752f3c1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2985064,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Laurent Stoop","original_name":"Laurent Stoop","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b74e62718ba3a943e4fca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2985064,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Laurent Stoop","original_name":"Laurent Stoop","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b74ec3b20c14afd50f037","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7612,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Orsola Valenti","original_name":"Orsola Valenti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b74f5303dade5dd6f4e02","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4618056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dodo Hunziker","original_name":"Dodo Hunziker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b7502564720d69ab08f75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Corinna Dästner","original_name":"Corinna Dästner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b750b79e0979366741815","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2985064,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Laurent Stoop","original_name":"Laurent Stoop","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b75123b20c14afd50f04d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Rodina","original_name":"Svetlana Rodina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b751b303dade5dd6f4e1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Cuendet","original_name":"Jérôme Cuendet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b754679e097936674182c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcel Vaid","original_name":"Marcel Vaid","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b754e2b8703bd752f3c3f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115796,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anna Infantyeva","original_name":"Anna Infantyeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b75592b8703bd752f3c4b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29367051","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aHS4MveAVKepWCklPmxFOyii6yT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":273967,"name":"war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"60.
