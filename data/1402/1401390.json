The Rich Should Be Richer raised the question of the ownership of sunlight in the late-capitalist metropolis and the association, both metaphorical and real, between poverty and darkness. The exhibition consisted of a series of screenprints, a proposal for a public art work, a parallel exhibition of Gustave Dor√©s engravings from London, and the 15 min video Four studies of Oslo and New York. The film placed discussions of new development in Oslo alongside Diego Rivera's painting of Manhattan, 'Frozen Assets' (1931), and scenes from the film 'The Fountainhead' (dir. King Vidor, 1949).","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Sudies of Oslo and New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ane Hjort Guttu","original_name":"Ane Hjort Guttu","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b7c3c5acc56044288ec76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
