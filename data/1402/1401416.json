Vladimir Carvalho opens the doors of Cinememória to Marcia Zarur's crew. Generously, he shares every detail of the Cinema Museum: pieces and equipment carefully collected over more than half a century. These objects tell the story of cinema in Brasília, Brazil, and the world, and, above all, reflect a lifelong passion for the art of filmmaking. The short film offers a joyful and lighthearted account, which turned out to be the filmmaker's final interview. Vladimir Carvalho suffered a heart attack an hour after the team left the site and passed away two weeks later.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":"/sYGU3AXHcFHYerhZ4qidfKxnRbI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2024-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vladimir Carvalho, Cinema e Memória","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Carvalho","original_name":"Vladimir Carvalho","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":"/rcmUqW0SQAEgOi0YTFc0xKxRTTM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"675b877e673096e5668e3b8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Zarur","original_name":"Marcia Zarur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"herself","credit_id":"675b878ff932dc771626cb12","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Zarur","original_name":"Marcia Zarur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b879f673096e5668e3bac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Stadniki","original_name":"Rafael Stadniki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b87aa673096e5668e3bb3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Stadniki","original_name":"Rafael Stadniki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b87bc02a3d330c5ee51d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Zarur","original_name":"Marcia Zarur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b87c638e9ae64cc610cff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115888,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diogo Ramos","original_name":"Diogo Ramos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b87dd02a3d330c5ee51fa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2474490,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Pimentel","original_name":"Gabriel Pimentel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b87f1c27f1565f579da33","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115932,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cris Costerus","original_name":"Cris Costerus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b8ab038e9ae64cc610de1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luiz de Melo","original_name":"Luiz de Melo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b8abec27f1565f579dbf5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115935,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paulo Paz","original_name":"Paulo Paz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b8ad0673096e5668e3da0","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Department Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1031,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/sYGU3AXHcFHYerhZ4qidfKxnRbI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":687},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"lo","file_path":"/ocDoYkrwJOWyd5ZXE7JqZEZ75KJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
