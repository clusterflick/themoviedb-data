The Prosecutor's Office and the Centro Estratégico de Valoración Probatoria (CEVAP) concluded that the shot was directed towards a “mob” of protesters threatening the police and that Dilan crossed the line of the shot intended for the “mob.” The Comité de Solidaridad con Presos Políticos, who legally represents Dilan's family, contacted us to study the visual evidence of the legal case and the methods used by state institutions. This research includes two audiovisual pieces: a counter-investigation of Dilan Cruz's legal case and a documentary about the front line in the protests.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuales de cuidado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5114660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Plano Negativo","original_name":"Plano Negativo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675af93260d6f448f1eed8b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
