He buys a grand piano with money from a loan shark and with the help of Noemi, a young girl of the same age he met in the library, he plays in the squares of Campania for passers-by and tourists. The security guard Enzo, after an argument, destroys his piano into many pieces. Chased by loan sharks, he finds himself in the back of a church. He is given a jacket and tie and is sent to the altar in front of the dead man's relatives. He begins to make a speech in commemoration of a deceased person he doesn't even know, but the words flow spontaneously, cleanly, moving and exciting. After that speech he will become the funeral boy, the orator.","popularity":0.1162,"poster_path":"/8LxuIOxkLd8G4N80PHYDsGFeVPy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155376,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ahora!
