Throughout a 30-year career, he scammed unsuspecting girlfriends, high profile businessmen, acquaintances and his best friends out of more than $60 million … and that’s just the people who came forward. Authorities suggest it could be twice that amount, as he wreaked havoc on a global scale targeting people in Canada, Asia, Europe and the UK, as well as at home in Australia. This special event series tracks the rise and fall of Australia’s most successful con man, and how Tom Zadravec, a young NSW Police detective, forensically pieced together Hamish’s scams and then brought him down.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/aL3fjRsb4bN1vJgNa7O9oHTYgIe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Con: The Life and Crimes of Hamish Mclaren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34727344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1159,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aL3fjRsb4bN1vJgNa7O9oHTYgIe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":773}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
