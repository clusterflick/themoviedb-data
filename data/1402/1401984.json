One endangered river. Will Stauffer-Norris and Zak Podmore hiked and paddled from Wyoming to Mexico along the Colorado River. They walk the Wind River Mountains, paddle the Flaming Gorge Reservoir, the Canyonlands, Lake Powell, the Grand Canyon, and Lake Mead. Ultimately, the mighty Colorado is reduced to a trickle and they must hike the Mexican desert to reach the sea. They witness the environmental damage done to the river and consider the ethics of draining a wild river to support a desert civilization. Local characters shed light on the complexities of the Colorado River.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3oea68KeusGPKOegeDheABwn5Av.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"REMAINS OF A RIVER: From Source to Sea Down the Colorado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Stauffer-Norris","original_name":"Will Stauffer-Norris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"675d25a7018dc8e7bbd177b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zak Podmore","original_name":"Zak Podmore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"675d25af72f58b3629a2a7d9","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3oea68KeusGPKOegeDheABwn5Av.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
