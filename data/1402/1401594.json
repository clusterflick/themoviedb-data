Now stranded, he drags the puppy across the hospital car park towards his mother's little red Ford KA that's clearly been sitting there for weeks as it's covered in parking tickets. Ripping the tickets off the car and tossing them into the air, this undynamic duo of boy and dog set off on their journey together. Walking through day and night, battling every weather-change imaginable, all against the backdrop of the green fields and cliffs of Dorset, they finally arrive at his childhood home.  Freezing and covered in snow, Ralph is left to unzip the duffel bag and face the reality of what his mother chose to take in with her to hospital.","popularity":0.2178,"poster_path":"/lEWxVTRQ8gHLKCCxkAsyKjUuM3t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":50,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"After a family bereavement, Ralph is left with only pieces of his past that he once held so dear.","title":"Ralph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3616435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archie Rowell","original_name":"Archie Rowell","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ralph","credit_id":"675c212d591e61e1b0bf18e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5116658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty-Boo","original_name":"Betty-Boo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"675c213d38e9ae64cc6125f0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3381214,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elliot Millson","original_name":"Elliot Millson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c2151b65c1a19cb9651c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3616435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archie Rowell","original_name":"Archie Rowell","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c216a38e9ae64cc6125f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter James Millson","original_name":"Peter James Millson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c2187f932dc771626e215","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5116661,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"ELLM","original_name":"ELLM","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c219838e9ae64cc61260f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lEWxVTRQ8gHLKCCxkAsyKjUuM3t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
