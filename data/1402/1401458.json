Over the next four decades, Sam and his son Alan grew the family business into the nation's largest name-brand specialty electronics retailer. In early 2009, after 60 years in business, the company spiraled into oblivion, destroying life-long careers and dreams of secure futures. How and why did it happen? 'A Tale of Two Cities: The Circuit City Story' is dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of associates who built Circuit City into a retail powerhouse, only to watch it descend into bankruptcy and liquidation. The documentary tells a tale of two 'Cities' -- one that went from good to great, and another that went from great to gone.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/41GF2OIiebdinKc7iT0XGLJpFpX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tale of Two Cities: The Circuit City Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5116164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Wulf","original_name":"Tom Wulf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675baa5f7f927d934f00cf39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1729505","wikidata_id":"Q4659955","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/41GF2OIiebdinKc7iT0XGLJpFpX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1047}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
