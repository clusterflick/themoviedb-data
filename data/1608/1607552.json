Until autumn 2024, they could sign six-month military contracts and receive a presidential pardon. Some of them had been convicted of serious crimes and thus avoided decades in prison. Among those released was the murderer of Kemerovo student Vera Pekhteleva — her parents learned about his freedom only six months later. We filmed the stories of victims whose mothers lost track of the convicted killers and still do not know where they are. We also spoke with two former offenders who returned from the front and are now trying to live as ordinary citizens.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Romb Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner Among Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Svoboda: vagnerovtsy sredi nas","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5909598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasilisa Varvarina","original_name":"Василиса Варварина","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a7c6650a414493e424a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5909598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasilisa Varvarina","original_name":"Василиса Варварина","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a7ca27d1f16d4574f395","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5909598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasilisa Varvarina","original_name":"Василиса Варварина","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a7d2894aad2210d7a60b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","original_name":"Владимир Севриновский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a7db4f27feed6f88ec42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","original_name":"Владимир Севриновский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a7e18a5a5bc08b74f51a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5909811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Glebova","original_name":"Елена Глебова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a7f1650a414493e424b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5909811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Glebova","original_name":"Елена Глебова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a800df21a1bbb4cbe3de","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
