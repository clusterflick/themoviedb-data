She longed for the same excitement and physical tenure as they had, the ability to defend oneself and to hone the Force. Years later, Vaylin begins this same training. One day, she is knocked down as Senya tells them to begin again. The lead training Knight charges her, but Vaylin uses the Force to suspend him and the others in the air. She concentrates, and in a moment of frustration, causes the Knight's armor to crack. Valkorian witnessed the entire ordeal, and takes Vaylin to an asylum on Nathema, where he plans to have the Nathema Zealots restrain her powers so that she will not surpass his own. Vaylin is locked away for years, but after Senya has a vision of Vaylin's suffering, she secretly travels to Nathema to rescue her daughter. The only question is, is it too late to be saved? Or does Vaylin already feel betrayed?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Wars: The Old Republic - Betrayed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
