Every attempt to cope—through love, indulgence, or isolation—only deepens the damage, turning connection into betrayal and self-protection into ruin. Whether he chooses responsibility or escape, the outcome is the same: loss. The film confronts the brutal truth that sometimes living through the wreckage hurts more than almost not living at all.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v31SiolGvctJeEhiGL8jd2Fntsl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":284943,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smity Cycle Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Coming To Nothing","title":"Coming to Nothing","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Smith","original_name":"Graham Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tyler","credit_id":"6956fa4125713176bbd7ae28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Christensen","original_name":"Michael Christensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6956fa60fb6e6179ce4ae8e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Quinn","original_name":"Melissa Quinn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Girl Friend","credit_id":"6956fa749c2f848f39d7ac4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach MCcomb","original_name":"Zach MCcomb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Brother","credit_id":"6956fa8669f1e6880c74f808","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ash Montoya","original_name":"Ash Montoya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fae4bc52bb4aa1c38dc2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ash Montoya","original_name":"Ash Montoya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fafadb151d9ef84aeb06","department":"Production","job":"Location Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911344,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gus Friend","original_name":"Gus Friend","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fb0f9ddde4d93588f300","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911346,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zach MCcomb","original_name":"Zach MCcomb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fb20de508858c9cbe658","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911348,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Zach MCcomb","original_name":"Zach MCcomb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fb3c68d074f5107c707d","department":"Art","job":"Conceptual Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5730058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kass McLeod","original_name":"Kass McLeod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fb5d5e13fdf58dcbe7de","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Smith","original_name":"Graham Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fce09c2f848f39d7ac61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5911361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Graham Smith","original_name":"Graham Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6956fcf074b02cdd3988f69f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@oreganoflask","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lV2YyTerf4Fpp74gJnzlBObHoBv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v31SiolGvctJeEhiGL8jd2Fntsl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":894,"name":"depression"},{"id":161545,"name":"alcoholic father"},{"id":222911,"name":"alcoholic son"},{"id":305104,"name":"introspection"},{"id":364938,"name":"dysfunction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Coming To Nothing Trailer","key":"uWo7Rkm7TPY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-12-31T09:14:41.000Z","id":"6956f40b0157bdd6fd88f4e3"}]}}}
