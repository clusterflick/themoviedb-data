That was the most exciting 20 minutes I have seen of you besides the debate [with Bill Nye \"the Science Guy\"]. You were on fire! You came off as so knowledgeable and credible, and it seemed as if the Holy Spirit was just pouring words out of you. I was cut to the heart by the conviction of your message. I don’t know the reach of that program, but anyone who sees it and is on the fence about these issues most definitely were convinced by God’s truth that you spoke. And those who take to the old-earth position were definitely given something to think about. It was so encouraging to hear you on there along with Russ Miller and Eric Hovind. I want you to know that because of your ministry and others, I am not in that statistic that will walk away from the church. I’m in high school, and I don’t know if God is calling me to the political scene or to science.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4QfsQCaj6ONOynHr3bh24aJEXv2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ken Ham on TBN's Praise the Lord","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4QfsQCaj6ONOynHr3bh24aJEXv2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
