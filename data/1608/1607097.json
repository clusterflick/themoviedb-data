Karol, affectionately called Lolek by his closest relatives and friends, is a young Polish theater actor, passionate about art. After the death of his father during the Second World War, his life underwent a drastic change. When he receives a book from a simple tailor, he is awakened by the desire to become a priest in the midst of Nazism, in a country devastated by war. Between the clandestine seminary, the fun ladies who help him, his curious students and, later, the fight against communism, the world will get to know the man who became the most famous Pope of all time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":284801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cia de Artes Shalom","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't be afraid.
