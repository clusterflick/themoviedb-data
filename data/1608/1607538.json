The Republic's gravest hour. Recently promoted to Darth, Malgus launches the first of many surprise attacks that would become his trademark during the Great War, perfectly timing the assault with a feint that pulls the Republic fleet light-years away. Thousands of assault droids and hundreds of Sith set the heart of the Republic ablaze, and Alderaan's few defenders are swept away with ease.  Unknown to Darth Malgus, small groups of Republic Troopers are stationed on Alderaan, some recovering from wounds, others are awaiting orders. As these brave soldiers take to the forests and mountains to fight a guerilla campaign against Malgus's forces, the Republic fleet rushes back to repel the invasion. With time running out and Alderaan's capitol threatened, it falls to Havoc Squad, the elite Republic Special Forces unit, to coordinate one last desperate stand against Malgus' vastly superior numbers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ojMga1Rod2Tt1MhGsrh5OfN6QLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15244,"logo_path":"/owlgJF10xFSYFBeYbv3ZUttOujP.png","name":"LucasArts","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10644,"logo_path":"/ocLZIdYJBppuCt1rhYEb2jbpt5F.png","name":"Blur Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Wars: The Old Republic - Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1029,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xjl900gdbNii0u1LvfmNtF1faWT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1829}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ojMga1Rod2Tt1MhGsrh5OfN6QLR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1632,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktv2TtZWVsIrheeTtQYYkmowl3a.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
