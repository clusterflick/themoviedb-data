Around fifteen countries — including Canada and Australia — continue to recognize the British monarch as their nominal head of state. In recent years, as relations between Russia and the West have sharply deteriorated, Britain has been portrayed as Russia’s principal arch-enemy, with imperialist thinking often cited as the root cause. In our new in-depth episode, we explore the history of the British Empire and ask whether it truly belongs to the past. We travel to London, to India — once the “jewel in the crown” — and to other countries that still have unresolved questions for the Empire and are demanding the repayment of historical debts.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":203,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Slaves to Bond: The Rise, Fall, and Legacy of the British Empire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Ot rabov do Bonda: istoriya vzleta, krakha i naslediya Britanskoy imperii","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Pivovarov","original_name":"Алексей Пивоваров","popularity":0.5544,"profile_path":"/aOgurNPIqqeSQ8mVFYzNmVk4rDG.jpg","credit_id":"6955a176de508858c9cbe0fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Pivovarov","original_name":"Алексей Пивоваров","popularity":0.5544,"profile_path":"/aOgurNPIqqeSQ8mVFYzNmVk4rDG.jpg","credit_id":"6955a17b31339b66b5710a23","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karina Mukhutdinova","original_name":"Карина Мухутдинова","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a182e45d58f0f6e41021","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3856537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ilya Kallion","original_name":"Илья Каллион","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a194b5a62664a7cbe469","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3853570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasia Lvova","original_name":"Анастасия Львова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a1a3478d01ceb571062e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
