The disembodied voice seeks to understand, but often confuses, Northern English vernacular and traditions against the current shifting political dialogue surrounding Britain’s future; misunderstanding Blackpool’s unique fantastical imagery as totemic remnants of a former era. Daniels presents his own contemporary 16mm and super-8 film observations as a found archive, and a script littered with word-play related to the local landscape and other seaside end-of-the-pier resorts.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5910425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Paul Daniels","original_name":"Chris Paul Daniels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695652317bd6f1459ee4196d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
