Ahmad Al-Gharban, a 16-year-old boy from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, survived an Israeli attack on March 22, 2025, but lost both legs and his fingers. His twin brother, Muhammad, his uncle, and a 6-year-old cousin were also killed. Ahmad began studying circus music at age 7 with his deceased brother, and dreamed of becoming a performer. Ahmad and his family currently live in a refugee camp where drones fly overhead 24/7. The camp is located on the site of the former Islamic University of Gaza.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3FuLNFcYP8Cu74HDkaWsCGWg0wG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from Gaza Episode 1 Ahmad's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","title":"اصوات من غزة الحلقة الاولى: قصة احمد","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5910466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Sawwaf","original_name":"Muhammad Sawwaf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695658711748af5a5bc3898f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5910469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Muhammad Sawwaf","original_name":"Muhammad Sawwaf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695659158e4bcaaa7a4ae59f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5910472,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Takashi Asai","original_name":"Takashi Asai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69565a52026c4cbe4388eda9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3FuLNFcYP8Cu74HDkaWsCGWg0wG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
