As Bettina Goering, grandniece of Nazi war criminal Herman Goering, searches for a way to come to terms with her heritage, she meets Ruth Rich, a painter and daughter of Holocaust survivors. At a time when seemingly irreconcilable divisions between groups are tearing the world apart, this deeply hopeful film is a beautiful testament to the power of dialogue and post-conflict reconciliation.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/dAPAwY6w4onHNTAMloBFy7NiutJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make
