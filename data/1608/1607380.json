This version is included as a special features extra on Criterion Collection's Bruce Lee Bluray/DVD box set released on July 14, 2020. Produced by Alan Canvan, \"Redux\" re-frames Lee's extended fight footage ( of which only approx 12 minutes were used in the original film) with composer John Barry's riveting score for the 1978 film, to reveal the hidden symbolism and themes within the narrative of the story. The result is a powerful and resonant cinematic novella that explores classical mythology and Jungian psychology, honoring the artistry of both Bruce Lee and John Barry.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/YVcQahcJboOIixYfA0gVmy18wl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话
