Яблонская","overview":"In March 2022, after Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city of Bucha, dozens of civilians were killed on Yablunska Street over the course of three days. Russian authorities later claimed that the footage of the massacre had been staged. However, testimony from survivors indicates that many civilians were not killed accidentally — they were deliberately targeted. Using CCTV recordings, drone footage, and military documents, the Ukrainian Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reconstructed a detailed account of the bloodiest days on Yablunska Street and identified some of the officers involved in these crimes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106491,"logo_path":"/zfKCwR4LRaLiUdutQpAV0AeVWdS.png","name":"RFE/RL","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bucha Documentary - Yablunska Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Bucha.
