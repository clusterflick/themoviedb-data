The film begins with ordinary situations that, in a different political context, would have remained part of everyday life: two lovers walking home hand in hand, flirting in a private chat, sharing a kiss on the street. In contemporary Russia, however, these simple acts trigger a chain of violence — because the lovers are of the same sex. And that has now become a crime. Flyers with photographs, curses, and threats appear in apartment buildings. A kiss in public leads to detention and beatings. Private messages in a closed group result in abduction straight from a university classroom and hours of police torture. Through the stories of Lyosha, two men named Sergey, and August, the film systematically reveals how this system operates — from everyday homophobia and workplace pressure to the actions of law enforcement agencies.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Okhota na radugu","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2358642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Loyk","original_name":"Никита Лойк","popularity":0.423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a429bf4a3fbe834ae2ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2358642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Loyk","original_name":"Никита Лойк","popularity":0.423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a42dd721a2cf0fc38ba4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5909791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stas Vokman","original_name":"Стас Вокман","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6955a437a993119b6de42198","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
