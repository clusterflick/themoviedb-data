When US President Bill Clinton visited Northern Ireland in November 1995, there was a celebration of peace on the streets. But, unknown to him, on the same day the IRA was already planning the attack that would end its 17-month ceasefire. Against the backdrop of an extraordinary political climate and knife-edge road to peace, The Docklands Bomb: Executing Peace unpacks the events that led to the bombing and follows the trail that led police to the South Armagh team behind it.
