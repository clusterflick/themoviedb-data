Spring 1944. Salamander, an old diplomat and a young commando Marek are parachuted into Nazi-occupied Poland. Salamander presents Churchill’s proposal to the leaders of the Polish underground: An agreement with the Soviets that will give Russia half of the territory of pre-war Poland, inhabited by ethnic minorities – Ukrainians, Belarusians and Latvians – but will allow the truncated country to maintain its independence. However, the diplomat is considered a traitor, poisoned and, as a result, paralyzed. What’s worse, betrayal is lurking everywhere – even Marek’s fiancée turns out to be a Soviet agent… Desperate Marek saves Salamander, taking him by plane to London along with the German V-2 rocket (captured by Polish intelligence). However, due to the delay, they reach Churchill too late. The Red Army has already entered Poland and a communist puppet government is established, completely subordinated to the Soviets.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109808,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZK Studio","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Code name SALAMANDER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konrad Szołajski","original_name":"Konrad Szołajski","popularity":0.7091,"profile_path":"/zluKpdrZlOys9VMlhIsllocURKQ.jpg","credit_id":"6956b9da0cf7610cedcbe72b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konrad Szołajski","original_name":"Konrad Szołajski","popularity":0.7091,"profile_path":"/zluKpdrZlOys9VMlhIsllocURKQ.jpg","credit_id":"6956b9e302500da7574aea32","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
