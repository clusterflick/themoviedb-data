With a payload capacity of up to 55 tonnes, it is capable of transporting even the heaviest materials with ease. When fully loaded, the vehicle reaches a total weight of nearly 100 tonnes. The XXL hauler is manufactured in Braås, southern Sweden, where around 550 employees produce a total of six different hauler models.
