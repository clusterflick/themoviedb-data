A “great little man,” as his friends describe him, Pavel played sublime music for two elderly women in an empty community hall with the same devotion he would have brought to Carnegie Hall. He wrote extraordinary novels and dared to protest, fully aware of the consequences. In 2024, Pavel Kushnir died in a prison in Birobidzhan.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":175642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narra","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kushnir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kushnir: Neizvestnaya istoriya Pavla Kushnira","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","original_name":"Сергей Ерженков","popularity":0.1768,"profile_path":"/niBmn0kUWgElf9694PzLOfroTyy.jpg","credit_id":"6955705eb460c4b4eed7a7cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","original_name":"Сергей Ерженков","popularity":0.1768,"profile_path":"/niBmn0kUWgElf9694PzLOfroTyy.jpg","credit_id":"695570627830eb1426c38801","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2141300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexander Urzhanov","original_name":"Александр Уржанов","popularity":0.6406,"profile_path":"/x5LN0Chont7jyech7wkaLL1E849.jpg","credit_id":"6955706de4e2030ab7d7a3e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5909548,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Kellermann","original_name":"Михаэль Келлерман","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695570a9bbf5e71732e41f81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
