Utan.","overview":"Orang. utan. follows Rocky the orangutan, a rescue from the entertainment industry housed at the Indianapolis Zoo. Rocky's intelligence is explored at this zoo, leading to new discoveries into the advanced cognition of orangutans as a species. Couple with intelligence, zookeeper Lisa Smith adds her testimony of Rocky's empathy and understanding of language. With the local research as a launchpad, the documentary goes overseas to Indonesia. Lief Cocks, the founder of The Orangutan Project, then makes the case that orangutans should be reclassified as \"persons.\" Using stories of intelligence, empathy, and understanding of language as evidence, the documentary raises a thesis of whether orangutans are people. The thesis is then cast aside, it being simply the vehicle to explore the encroaching extinction of the entire species the documentary explores. The story ends with a call to arms, and a potential way to save a species from certain death.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xT6mSzyAIpcrvCa5fvEqYwJrbbD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"On track for extinction","title":"Orang.
