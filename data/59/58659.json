He is given a cruise ticket by an aristocrat who is an old school friend, and is mistaken for the aristocrat when he uses a camera that has his friends name on it. Assia Noris plays a maid who falls in love with him because of who he is and not who others think he is. Happy ending comes when De Sica marries Noris, who is more real than the pampered society belles he has been partying with.","popularity":0.2678,"poster_path":"/bCOo9QkE1zerXBhccjycngqp312.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37776,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1937-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mister Max","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio De Sica","original_name":"Vittorio De Sica","popularity":0.618,"profile_path":"/SObzAVAFAzCSM5nmpvpNdX7oxq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gianni / Max Varaldo","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Assia Noris","original_name":"Assia Noris","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/o3MWnCncgk5hXzfeatf7RXEunRr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lauretta","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rubi D'Alma","original_name":"Rubi D'Alma","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/v50exy7BhfZgl5339A48yoHJi7r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Donna Paola","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":572302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilia Dale","original_name":"Lilia Dale","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pucci","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d47","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caterina Collo","original_name":"Caterina Collo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Zia Lucia","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umberto Melnati","original_name":"Umberto Melnati","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/rFdVE4KywrqAD4QWoCRTs2qxoxS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Riccardo","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d4f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Casaleggio","original_name":"Mario Casaleggio","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Zio Pietro","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d53","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virgilio Riento","original_name":"Virgilio Riento","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":"/dCzOoG756RhXRWMmkf9WspNHjkV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Pepe","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d57","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivi Gioi","original_name":"Vivi Gioi","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/l6WpnvsNO8FEyKSYTDRmCEwqTPe.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dolly (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe496ec3a36847f8199d5b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Contessa","original_name":"Michele Contessa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"(uncredited)","credit_id":"58e70a0d925141354c00c141","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romolo Costa","original_name":"Romolo Costa","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/a5jYpyDqGqFSYmxO2hw1tawus7t.jpg","cast_id":27,"character":"Il commandante Baldi (uncredited)","credit_id":"58e70a16c3a36872af0448fb","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Dorcoratto","original_name":"Luciano Dorcoratto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":28,"character":"Guido (uncredited)","credit_id":"58e70a1f92514134eb00c81f","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Ghigi","original_name":"Ernesto Ghigi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":29,"character":"Pierino (uncredited)","credit_id":"58e70a27925141354c00c158","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Nobile","original_name":"Desiderio Nobile","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":30,"character":"Il maggiore (uncredited)","credit_id":"58e70a31c3a3687302045f2a","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Padoa","original_name":"Clara Padoa","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":31,"character":"Jeanne -
