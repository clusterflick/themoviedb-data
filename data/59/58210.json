Clarkson sets out to explore both what compels us to pursue these limits--often at considerable risk to our own safety--and what effect the quest has on us. The result was an immensely engaging series, a few highlights of which are collected on this video. The best moments are those that find Clarkson sticking to the brief: interviewing the aristo-twit tobogganers of the Cresta Run; trying to understand why he, an experienced driver, will never be as fast as Michael Schumacher or Colin McRae; a musing on the qualities needed to be a fighter pilot; an examination of the extraordinary sport of speed-skiing, in which cat-suited kamikazes hit speeds of up to 150 miles an hour.","popularity":0.431,"poster_path":"/vZbG28b4gtVVfOlEQctNgACmixy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":15995,"logo_path":"/fC67EXOiEXLkhe9DPdSVXQ5C1Za.png","name":"TLC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The best moments from the TV series in which Jeremy Clarkson meets people who are addicted to speed.","title":"Jeremy Clarkson's Speed","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jeremy Clarkson: Speed","type":"Alternative format"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4959c3a36847f8195725","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Grist","original_name":"Bill Grist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5baf948dc3a36805520001e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583808,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Maguire","original_name":"John Maguire","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5baf9541c3a36805410003ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yMz0uDH44XbGRZgdVMwqFCU723p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vZbG28b4gtVVfOlEQctNgACmixy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.568,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dFkAGlwkfz16pUdbmbs3xRqM3CZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3428,"name":"speed"},{"id":247871,"name":"clarkson"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Date of last episode airing.
