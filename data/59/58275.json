Strap in and watch as the horsepower levels continue to climb and the speedometer needles fly past speed limits and approach the edge of sanity. In this chapter of the Super Speeders series you'll see just how far Rob, Matt and Vinny can get with 3 cars and $1500 between them. You'll also see the most outlandish challenge attempted to date when the Super Speeders see who can intentionally get a ticket first. This is the video you will be telling your friends about for years to come.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/h9PnwnsGVIi37nvsgTct1EBD11e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Speeders 5 - Out Of Control","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":860,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h9PnwnsGVIi37nvsgTct1EBD11e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
