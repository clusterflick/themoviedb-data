Its worldwide success catapulted the film's lead actor, Romanian-born Bela Lugosi, to overnight stardom. \"Bela Lugosi: The Fallen Vampire\" traces the life and career of this mysterious man whose name became synonymous with the evil, yet magnetically compelling Count Dracula. Using archival still and film clips as well as interviews with film historians, actors and Lugosi himself, the special chronicles the meteoric rise and then precipitous decline of a talented yet tragic man who forever changed the face of horror films.","popularity":0.4633,"poster_path":"/1hpPCtvDU9Lg94xw5VyW1dPn1ku.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4313,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVRO
