Their formerly close-knit group has all but disbanded in the wake of encroaching adulthood. But when Jack tries to hang himself from a plant hook while house-sitting, he inadvertently triggers an impromptu reunion that brings the old gang back together and could change everything. Forever. Welcome to DAKOTA: friendship, fistfights, concussions, quarter-life crises, blow-ups, breakdowns, toy guns, telemarketing, love, lies, and breakfast - all in someone else's home. In this dark, offbeat comedy everyone comes together to examine what went wrong. Along the way, they may just remind each other what went right.","popularity":0.7838,"poster_path":"/beOPRNtvGoyExJIsVqaFjdCtA3u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only thing harder than leaving home is coming back.","title":"Dakota","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Donella","original_name":"Chad Donella","popularity":0.9269,"profile_path":"/iUOcGIj18DpXBJdAx3qmmKNF1wp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack (as Chad E.
