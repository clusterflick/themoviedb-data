Older brother Danny concocts a daring scheme to steal enough money for the two to escape, timed around the chaos of an upcoming Rolling Stones concert. The sensitive younger brother, Brian, ultimately has a choice: remain loyal to the brother with whom he shares a powerful love-hate bond, or use his hidden talent as an artist as his own ticket out of their dead-end existence.","popularity":1.5869,"poster_path":"/2PhS5FoPvF0SWSVWqWEUv5B85FB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Annus Mirabilis
