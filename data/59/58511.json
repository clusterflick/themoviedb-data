Nothing to get worked up about in a western European country, you would think – and you’d be wrong. Even in Euroland there are places where the acknowledgment of the basic civil rights of same-sex couples is a hot issue. Suddenly, Gustav’s and Luca’s quiet private life has been turned upside down. When the Italian center-left coalition initiates legislation about same-sex partnerships in Italy, a national debate is triggered instantly. In a matter of days it turns into the hottest political and cultural issue on the national agenda while intolerant homophobic attacks increase dramatically.","popularity":0.1162,"poster_path":"/jEAUe70bklNtPP8fIvzaeMO7J6v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42755,"logo_path":null,"name":"hiq productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suddenly, Last Winter","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustav Hofer","original_name":"Gustav Hofer","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4966c3a36847f8198105","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ragazzi","original_name":"Luca Ragazzi","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4966c3a36847f8198109","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Pivetti","original_name":"Veronica Pivetti","popularity":0.287,"profile_path":"/jK3ovXXdpkcrW4Mvm8EcOFd35vL.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Voce narrante","credit_id":"52fe4966c3a36847f819810d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustav Hofer","original_name":"Gustav Hofer","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4966c3a36847f81980fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ragazzi","original_name":"Luca Ragazzi","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4966c3a36847f8198101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755319,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Desideria Rayner","original_name":"Desideria Rayner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589e546ec3a3684bad001337","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1185600","wikidata_id":"Q676694","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jKSBliRLTpKLWIHJmtNNckjGxy4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/hdOvV5Bk24bEToN3FIawccn5FRr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jEAUe70bklNtPP8fIvzaeMO7J6v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":131,"name":"italy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2008-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
