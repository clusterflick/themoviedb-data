We meet the romantic skyjackers who fought their revolutions and won airtime on the passenger planes of the 1960s and '70s. By the 1990s, such characters were apparently no more, replaced on our TV screens by stories of anonymous bombs in suitcases. Director Johan Grimonprez investigates the politics behind this change, at the same time unwrapping our own complicity in the urge for ultimate disaster.","popularity":0.1016,"poster_path":"/2OtaxewaMNQDiFdG55bLecACLFL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12998,"logo_path":"/naSCIDEqnFuEttggDVgZIMtgxzz.png","name":"Centre Georges Pompidou","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4952c3a36847f819415b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"5c7e6572925141276316ac98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"5c7e65660e0a2643015a1a3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Joly","original_name":"Nicolas Joly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7e657f925141277d16b51a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656357,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Shea","original_name":"David Shea","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece6d03aaec710020671d09","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0367655","wikidata_id":"Q17104796","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2OtaxewaMNQDiFdG55bLecACLFL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
