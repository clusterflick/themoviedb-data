As the music industry has exploded over the past few decades and the ability to \"move units\" has become the defining calculus of the business, it's an incredibly emotional experience to see a band who does it because they have to, because their lives depend on it, and because they love it. There are hundreds of such bands criss-crossing the country at any given moment. This is a film about one of them-a band on the edge of greatness, working to break through. In a happy bit of rock kismet, \"Dreaming in America's\" cameras started rolling just as Lucero was breaking from its indie rock past and considering the treacherous leap to a major label deal unlike anything seen by the industry before. At that point, the band was between labels and, though it had sold north of 20,000 records.","popularity":0.3094,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreaming in America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Berry","original_name":"Roy Berry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"52fe4975c3a36847f819b1e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Nichols","original_name":"Ben Nichols","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Vocals / Guitar","credit_id":"52fe4975c3a36847f819b1e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John C.
