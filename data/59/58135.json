Nina, the clockmaker's little girl, begins to dream. She is a little street singer. And a ballerina in love with a little tin soldier. And a princess in search of her beautiful knight lost in the enchanted forest. From burglary to castle attack, from mermaid to dragon, the adventure never stops... like the hands of a clock.","popularity":0.1491,"poster_path":"/tcpfKtA3cBBmHXQZV5MwxSI7hJo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales of the Magic Clock","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Star","original_name":"Nina Star","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4955c3a36847f8194e03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rufus","original_name":"Rufus","popularity":0.3064,"profile_path":"/aC6rEJrBgCNjeG6vetJPBdgj5h3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5342cb37c3a3681517003a3f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Władysław Starewicz","original_name":"Wladyslaw Starewicz","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/dOnxDnOYDL7brv0nxspT8Zth8bu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4955c3a36847f8194df9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227409,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Marie Sénia","original_name":"Jean-Marie Sénia","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4955c3a36847f8194dff","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0408636","wikidata_id":"Q16654881","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tcpfKtA3cBBmHXQZV5MwxSI7hJo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
