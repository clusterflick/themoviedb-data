Joseph Côté escapes from a prison in order to avoid death by hanging. Moreover, while some colonial soldiers are chasing him, Joseph takes the identity of a Jesuit and hides in the seigneury of Beaufort where most men are waiting for \"daughters of the king.\" (French women who were sent to Canada in order to find a husband.) At night, Joseph finds out that there are werewolves that terrorize the village. Besides, things get complicated when he falls in love with Marie Labotte, a \"daughter of the king\" that no one wants to marry. All in all, by simply trying to protect his life and Marie's, Joseph will end up fighting against the werewolves.","popularity":0.5042,"poster_path":"/ev6aXkqh9IVOqDHOQFqvbwHK7wA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73565,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films du
