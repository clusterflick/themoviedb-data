It’s a story about cruelty, transformation, and the monstrous side of revenge—all wrapped in a delightfully ridiculous Halloween package. Balancing dark themes with absurd fun, the film delivers both chills and laughs, celebrating the spirit of B-movie horror while offering a tragic yet twistedly empowering tale.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Princess of the Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6007384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciana Kurzius","original_name":"Luciana Kurzius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"6990b3dd7aa5cd852d347445","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6007387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Ferreiras","original_name":"Max Ferreiras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Max","credit_id":"6990b404e6b55aaf0f7f670e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Sophia London","original_name":"Jacqueline Sophia London","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jackie/Princess of the Murder","credit_id":"6990b42b1f62580181c8f1ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6007391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Kordell","original_name":"Rachel Kordell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"6990b457aa1aa913ad24d1f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Spencer","original_name":"Lynn Spencer","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lynn","credit_id":"6990b494672ee10db64eccc4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Sophia London","original_name":"Jacqueline Sophia London","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6990b512ae36e5a1dcdb0369","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
