What begins as a tense exchange of insults over a \"veggie cake\" quickly spirals into a lethal psychological game when a loaded pistol is introduced to the festivities. As he commits a cold-blooded murder in the living room, he must maintain a facade of suburban normalcy for his oblivious mother, who remains in the kitchen preparing juice and discussing his father's criminal past. In this dark comedy-thriller, the line between a \"sick joke\" and a sociopathic break disappears, proving that some birthday wishes are better left ungranted.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":204000,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some wishes are better left ungranted...","title":"Veggie Cake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonah Hill","original_name":"Jonah Hill","popularity":3.1372,"profile_path":"/5aE4GgJADHzN1QsS6zkzElZSEYq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donald","credit_id":"69905ce0e6b55aaf0f7f642e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cera","original_name":"Michael Cera","popularity":3.2596,"profile_path":"/qjhNKsw0OLyZQgK4srhelBafcCf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wyatt","credit_id":"69905d18b34b4e0ae3db01b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scarlett Johansson","original_name":"Scarlett Johansson","popularity":16.1065,"profile_path":"/mjReG6rR7NPMEIWb1T4YWtV11ty.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"69905d24df03a0f203347196","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5431193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Manley","original_name":"Luke Manley","popularity":2.2444,"profile_path":"/xseCUIslZFDykrgxRV6k7tuzlsF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pop","credit_id":"69905d3bc8dcf1971024cfc0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucas Wegnez González","original_name":"Lucas Wegnez González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nigel","credit_id":"69905d5e8b3bf294ce7f634f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothée Chalamet","original_name":"Timothée Chalamet","popularity":11.6868,"profile_path":"/dFxpwRpmzpVfP1zjluH68DeQhyj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Racist Uncle","credit_id":"69905d6a8a7cc95eadc8f078","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Ford Coppola","original_name":"Francis Ford Coppola","popularity":2.4789,"profile_path":"/IwGgkmW6IoJ9vuNF0T9CU3FYUX.jpg","credit_id":"69905d7fdedd8066144eccf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Coen","original_name":"Joel Coen","popularity":2.7754,"profile_path":"/rgVaJNkZCgMarUcZuUAsVfXMWk3.jpg","credit_id":"69905d9351f1032cea8c9620","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
