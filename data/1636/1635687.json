Self-managed, always open, free, and accessible to all, the F.L.I.A. is a channel for free expression that continues to grow and expand throughout Argentina and the world.  Narrated by its protagonists and accompanied by a dynamic cascade of images, Tomás Larrinaga (\"El Gauchito Gil, La Sangre Inocente\") captures the essence of this phenomenon.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Subterraneans - Visions and stories about the F.
