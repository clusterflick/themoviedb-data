In a new documentary, The Kyiv Independent’s War Crimes Investigations Unit uncovers the torture of Ukrainian civilians held by Russian forces and traces the roots of these practices through Russian history. The documentary features civilians from different regions and backgrounds who were detained in occupied Ukrainian territories and in Russia itself. Despite being held at different times and in different locations, their testimonies describe strikingly similar patterns of abuse. By combining firsthand accounts with historical research, the investigation shows how torture has persisted across generations and continues to shape Russia’s war against Ukraine.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":251670,"logo_path":"/hLn81UTLgRYAkkftIza00lg1OOh.png","name":"The Kyiv Independent","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russia’s Culture of Torture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5465333,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danylo Mokryk","original_name":"Данило Мокрик","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6991a4b887d414d8ba1240e1","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6008825,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Мирослава Чаюн","original_name":"Мирослава Чаюн","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6991a4cb8e515e6cd4287402","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"UA","iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/zOsubAKSlDa8N8FLUKfnEp1e80n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jsf5GdBONwoClDLTQZ0eN9Yw4eq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
