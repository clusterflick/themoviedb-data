Constantly picking each other apart and holding on to petty slights for decades, we can still see that underneath all their vicious co-dependent fighting they have a deep love for each other. Into their world steps a young man, Ash (Iwan Rheon), as their new upstairs neighbour. Joining Freddie and Stuart is feisty best friend Violet (Frances de la Tour), young at heart and with a deliciously dry sense of humour.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wQXGZVgT5FbitW9WHmVkYCDEnGk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vicious Series 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQXGZVgT5FbitW9WHmVkYCDEnGk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1048}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
