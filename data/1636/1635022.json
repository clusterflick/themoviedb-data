Dr. Paul Proteus, an up-and-coming executive at the Federal Apparatus Corporation, finds his life imploding – or perhaps he’s just beginning to see things clearly. Will he rise to the top of a company that makes people worthless? Or rebel against the system for the sake of all humankind?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":289220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabulascope","origin_country":""},{"id":181445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picture Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":37765,"logo_path":"/qzSgwjZkVmruPVT6oUTocut4znA.png","name":"Verdi Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Player Piano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed Morano","original_name":"Reed Morano","popularity":0.7644,"profile_path":"/fXtvqRCPMDhXwvgc3V2oC4GT3AP.jpg","credit_id":"698f996de577214b51da5917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Vonnegut","original_name":"Kurt Vonnegut","popularity":0.4208,"profile_path":"/yEttml8qBkDC6FsdYtfkXkWB54V.jpg","credit_id":"698f997faaa0ce41229391e8","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6005882,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Walker","original_name":"Matthew Walker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698f99b5ad4de4d713587b7e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margot Hand","original_name":"Margot Hand","popularity":0.6967,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698f9a1b715b9a610dbcfe2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reed Morano","original_name":"Reed Morano","popularity":0.7644,"profile_path":"/fXtvqRCPMDhXwvgc3V2oC4GT3AP.jpg","credit_id":"698f9a2d53a2b04a02bcfe87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chad A.
