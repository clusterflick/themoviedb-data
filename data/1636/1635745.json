The entire film was shot in the room of Ethiopia Hotel. This limited space allows the film to focus on their communication and captures some of the ideas that enable the children to endure and survive on the street. Indeed, this film is more a sensitive testimony than a scientific documentary. This hybrid approach aims to explore new trends in visual anthropology, including the issue of dealing with intimacy and subjectivity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Room 11, Ethiopia Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6008280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yohanis Charnet","original_name":"Yohanis Charnet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"699128d476fc6c7ae26f6356","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6008281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shiferow Bimrow","original_name":"Shiferow Bimrow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"699128e52a1af8c6de958a9b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6008278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Itsushi Kawase","original_name":"Itsushi Kawase","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699128a9037515daa5287314","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":237188,"name":"ethnography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
