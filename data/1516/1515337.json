The video was the singer's favourite at the time, and was her sole one in sepia tone. It was broadcast for the first time in the television show Top 50 on Canal+ a few weeks after the single release.

Farmer said in an interview that the sobriety of the clip was well suited to this song.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eDkvRVZu1xqJJdGgwJljwrTADnD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mylène Farmer: Ainsi soit je...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mylène Farmer","original_name":"Mylène Farmer","popularity":0.9124,"profile_path":"/p5U9gpQu1uO1pDiBET56ASmwb4j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"687a8c1ea5746dc859243bb2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":448563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Boutonnat","original_name":"Laurent Boutonnat","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/x46nT4Ks2t3NQxZ3gejG45QWNIv.jpg","credit_id":"687a8c313628225df7d98336","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":448563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Boutonnat","original_name":"Laurent Boutonnat","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/x46nT4Ks2t3NQxZ3gejG45QWNIv.jpg","credit_id":"687a8c5380971a73a35282b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":448563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Boutonnat","original_name":"Laurent Boutonnat","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/x46nT4Ks2t3NQxZ3gejG45QWNIv.jpg","credit_id":"687a8c6db94e667f8b528247","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3052591,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Pascal Thiollier","original_name":"Pascal Thiollier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a8c822b930fb6d55282bf","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mylène Farmer","original_name":"Mylène Farmer","popularity":0.9124,"profile_path":"/p5U9gpQu1uO1pDiBET56ASmwb4j.jpg","credit_id":"687a8cb2bf9903a48bf75ead","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2374472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1045,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eDkvRVZu1xqJJdGgwJljwrTADnD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1988-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
