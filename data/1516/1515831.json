Filmed locally, it contrasts the natural beauty of iconic locations like Mount Katahdin and Cadillac Mountain with the stark reality faced by unhoused individuals living in encampments. Through intimate interviews with residents, advocates, nonprofit workers, and State Senator Joe Baldacci, the film exposes the systemic challenges and personal stories behind the crisis. InhuMaine offers a sobering look at the hidden darkness within so-called Vacationland, urging viewers to see beyond the postcard-perfect views and confront an urgent need for change. -NB, TL, JP, BW","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"InhuMaine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Kapp","original_name":"Ryan Kapp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c18f1a9c1f6893e38d23b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rogan O'Donnell","original_name":"Rogan O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c190a3628225df7d98969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Kapp","original_name":"Ryan Kapp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c1939a5746dc859244213","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rogan O'Donnell","original_name":"Rogan O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c1947e50e3bcc55169bd8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Kapp","original_name":"Ryan Kapp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c19586199336bf12440ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rogan O'Donnell","original_name":"Rogan O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c1968b756a2f57d528761","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sazha Alexandra Ramos","original_name":"Sazha Alexandra Ramos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c1982b756a2f57d52876a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Maine International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
