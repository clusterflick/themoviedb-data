However, beneath the allure lies a city controlled by the American mafia, where luxury contrasts sharply with the poverty endured by most Cubans. U.S. tourists escape Prohibition and moral restrictions back home. Icons like Ernest Hemingway, Frank Sinatra, and Ava Gardner revel in the city’s rhythms, frequenting hotspots like the Hotel Nacional and the Tropicana nightclub. Yet beneath the surface, corruption and oppression grip Cuba. Dictator Fulgencio Batista secretly partners with the mafia to build a “Las Vegas in the Caribbean” fueling unrest as the Cuban people suffer. This tension paves the way for Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries, who, on January 8, 1959, triumphantly enter Havana and end U.S. dominance on the island.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/r6HWzREDjwV2NS27IL1XEKE3JIO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115609,"logo_path":"/k4N9VeUWiOv0I5wr1hHy5JKbjNM.png","name":"Autentic","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rum & Revolution – History of Havana","title":"Rum & Revolution – History of Havana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Rum & Revolution – History of Havana","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Schild","original_name":"Katja Schild","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"687a7a21468d79140272bfb6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2313929,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anselme Pau","original_name":"Anselme Pau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"687a7cb5cd0a0d7884f75d94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moritz Frisc","original_name":"Moritz Frisc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"687a7cc6440b8c6121f75d40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391655,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Fejzuli","original_name":"David Fejzuli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"687a7cd004999af3d452828e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2967861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabian Wolf","original_name":"Fabian Wolf","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a71e050915a744e243b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2967861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabian Wolf","original_name":"Fabian Wolf","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a79e8da3bd92a1a55c387","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2967622,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Hörl","original_name":"Patrick Hörl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a7af24d77a048e438ccaf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Martin","original_name":"Andreas Martin","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a7b0d80aff51a8555c3b5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2967620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katrin Pecher","original_name":"Katrin Pecher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a7b233d8d9dfd9038cd9b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35671263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e3CIiaOm2fn1VbrVB5ZkdrrBI8G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r6HWzREDjwV2NS27IL1XEKE3JIO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":615}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":11933,"name":"conflict"},{"id":304824,"name":"documentry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mythos Havanna: Mojito, Mambo, Mafia | ARTE","key":"l-PovZ_kCbw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-02T22:00:45.000Z","id":"687a799598c597f11a8a3f6b"}]}}}
