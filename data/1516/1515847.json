Rui Carlos repairs his worn-out shoes and heads out to borrow a valuable football from their neighbor, Dona Olinda, who daily entrusts it to him. As the teams are chosen and the game begins, typical neighborhood interruptions ensue: a visit from Mascote the dog, a break for lunch, and spontaneous games. But when the ball gets punctured, Rui Carlos is left to face responsibility and the realities of growing up.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/8Td4q3Og1MyzvvYwJNjroM6zl5z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bravado
