His filmography includes The Ruling Class (1972), The Changeling (1980), A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1971), The Krays (1990), and others, all which capitalize on these ideas. Sanity is fragile, ephemeral, and suspended from a very thin tether in all his films. This piece gets to the bottom of why Medak centers his work on such themes, and why they carry biographical weight for him personally.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9HGMICwQmp8eI00Jt0ecBuqvxPT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts they played","title":"Love Left the Masquerade: Peter Medak's Cinema of Pretenders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Medak","original_name":"Peter Medak","popularity":0.5199,"profile_path":"/oUPjJXMOSomwrqFx4eobxROVZOV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6879a2cb1d76c9aaa9f75a71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6879a2de51b22c777816929e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter O'Toole","original_name":"Peter O'Toole","popularity":2.0112,"profile_path":"/bk2AIN5yjqkthDUxUH0Q4U2ekRH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Archive","credit_id":"6879b63bf9fcc95b9ad98121","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenda Jackson","original_name":"Glenda Jackson","popularity":0.3754,"profile_path":"/n9A2ks6rdkCKouFXxh9OeEmoR40.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Archive","credit_id":"6879b6473d8d9dfd9038ca02","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Bates","original_name":"Alan Bates","popularity":0.8195,"profile_path":"/aqorhHCrgICHKP4nAJK9IB4xGGa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Archive","credit_id":"6879b6531600dcfb762438fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sellers","original_name":"Peter Sellers","popularity":1.4883,"profile_path":"/sCVIv2DGoC9U16anTjLwMxKBPZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Archive","credit_id":"6879b66148ea55973355c040","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"6879a29789990311ec527f6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"6879a2a289990311ec527f72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"6879a2ab440b8c6121f75a7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37610649","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9HGMICwQmp8eI00Jt0ecBuqvxPT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":851}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
