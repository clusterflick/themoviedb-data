In November, the start of the new school year already seems like a long time ago. The grey sky has replaced the blue and green of the summer. However, for the pupils of the primary and secondary schools, dullness is not on the agenda! Artists have come in town. They go into the classrooms with colours, stories and rhythms coming from somewhere else in their luggage. Things that can fill out the imagination, things that make anyone dream. We go with them, and on the way, we talk to them. We meet teachers and parents who are delighted to give free rein to the dream part that lies dormant in everyone of us.
