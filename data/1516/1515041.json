This initiative represented a cultural conflict by opening spaces in Argentine politics, such as the foreign ministry and foreign relations, to workers. The film seeks to illustrate this cultural battle. The labor attaché is presented as an archetype of a disruptive and transformative movement, both nationally and internationally, which served as inspiration for the expansion of social rights. Their plan of action included spreading Justicialism in the Latin American labor movement and forming ATLAS (Agrupación de Trabajadores Latinoamericanos Sindicalistas). Labor attachés, as ambassadors of the working class, played a crucial role wherever they operated, becoming involved in internal conflicts and risking their lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ecf3oMvMPWrYAhgIcFzsLv9alaC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122970,"logo_path":null,"name":"3C Films Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2025-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agregados obreros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Rest","original_name":"Marcelo Rest","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6879be7e6199336bf12438fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":542245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Alonso","original_name":"Gustavo Alonso","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6879be96268343956855c06e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ecf3oMvMPWrYAhgIcFzsLv9alaC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Cine Gaumont","release_date":"2025-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Agregados obreros Trailer Oficial","key":"8kaFSvIE75M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-07-14T15:42:37.000Z","id":"6879bf04096e0ed3fb72bbc7"}]}}}
