As its title suggests, the film is a diary in which the author records his observations of the outside world; as Silvan Furlan writes, it “evokes with a certain nostalgia those golden days of the underground, when the freedom of filmmaking was written in capital letters.” Film theorist Jože Dolmark appraised it best: “the film contains a desire to record (not strictly chronologically) the experience of a lived day: what happened to you, what you experienced, or which is more interesting, what you would like the day to look like, according to how you’ve imagined it. I think the entire power of DAILY NEWS lies in this desire of Franci’s for what remained unspoken, what slipped, what remained outside the edges, and what we’ll never know.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daily News","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franci Slak","original_name":"Franci Slak","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687c297b1bc0fd1b57d989c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
