Indira grows into a ‘modern’ young woman while Binod, disinherited when his stepfather has a son, works in a distant village. Indira haughtily refuses a relationship with a pauper but she eventually realises her duties to her husband and goes to meet him disguised as Shanta, a beggar woman. Binod then falls in love with her, not realising she is in fact his wife.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2636BIMHo2XxXxySBgIsZBfFJmF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swami","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sitara Devi","original_name":"Sitara Devi","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/96QpNnVWbhGGALZKNjiW03oRyx9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Indira","credit_id":"687a1f54fe85a1d545243a2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
