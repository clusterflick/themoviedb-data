We’ve got you covered! Rarely screened for some reason, this ‘80s blockbuster sees three of Hong Kong’s most athletic action stars clock out and head to Europe where they skateboard, run a food truck, fight dudes on dirt bikes, try to impress girls, and get in fights. A lot of fights. A leisurely action movie, a frenetic comedy, a hang out, a vibe — it’s a sheer slice of ultra-‘80s summertime style coupled with a bunch of expert Hong Kong comedy kickass.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sundays on Fire: Secret Hong Kong 35mm Feature","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
