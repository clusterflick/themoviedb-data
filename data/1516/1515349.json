The story follows Billy, a once-popular middle school student who bullies others without remorse—until a life-altering accident leaves him permanently disfigured. Returning to school, Billy finds himself on the other side of the ridicule he used to dish out. Through emotional and social isolation, he begins to understand the pain he once caused and learns the value of empathy, kindness, and self-reflection.  Originally shown in classrooms across the United States, Scars became a staple of anti-bullying programs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. With its honest and heartfelt message, the film continues to resonate with viewers as a timeless lesson in compassion and growth.","popularity":0.1714,"poster_path":"/bLMsKEG2F12DQGNhQCCRMfAg3nh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Part of the Bullying Prevention Series by Thomas Brown","title":"Scars","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Lawler","original_name":"Danny Lawler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"687a9cef22300a50a772bf4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Folk","original_name":"Michael Folk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"687a9d121db2322db038ccfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Inman","original_name":"Vivian Inman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"687a9d1f6309222fee72bf5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsie Fletcher","original_name":"Kelsie Fletcher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sister","credit_id":"687a9d470e4818a999528332","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849385,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Justin Howell","original_name":"Justin Howell","popularity":0.2999,"profile_path":"/fMo49t3T3AUaUDUAQqJqFbX1DOQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"687a9d7220e51d61b7243d24","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256729,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Brown","original_name":"Thomas Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a91cacd0a0d7884f75dd4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bLMsKEG2F12DQGNhQCCRMfAg3nh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SCARS - School Video Sample","key":"lN4nkrUVFpQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2008-05-28T18:43:55.000Z","id":"687a9285b756a2f57d528269"}]}}}
