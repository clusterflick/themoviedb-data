Through these letters, the young women ask the older women about their intimate lives. This creates a space that sheds light on both the taboos and the discomfort that persist around the topic. A space open to silence and deep conversations. At the same time, we discover the stories that characterize these social figures.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":268473,"logo_path":null,"name":"DBD producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barreras","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Chaves Rua","original_name":"Paula Chaves Rua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bee0a6d678e7159d987d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martina Pavía Piñero","original_name":"Martina Pavía Piñero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bee1e1b63a0b008d98961","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574432,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raúl González","original_name":"Raúl González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bee4f2e48947adff76286","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iara Conde","original_name":"Iara Conde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bee6cd9da18e5168a4484","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574434,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sebastián Miranda","original_name":"Sebastián Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bee993855a70164244190","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gonzalo Saporiti","original_name":"Gonzalo Saporiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687beeabe242da0f0f55c7f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574436,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clara Marcus","original_name":"Clara Marcus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687beecc72ce78392c8a443f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574437,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Saúl","original_name":"Victoria Saúl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687beee438bd91079155c81c","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574438,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rodrigo Muñoz","original_name":"Rodrigo Muñoz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687beefc22300a50a772c3f7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5574440,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Aime Garcia","original_name":"Aime Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bef0cfb418b1ac138d1a2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":41404,"name":"sexual desire"},{"id":211558,"name":"body"},{"id":313129,"name":"older women"},{"id":347784,"name":"mujeres"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
