Diaa requests filmmaker Muhannad to use his phone to capture raw visual materials during his displacement journey from Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah since October. Mohammad’s compliance cements a bond forged during their student days and addresses the phenomenon of data clouding and transferring through alternative channels like Telegram. Using the chat window as a visual element to evoke a sense of our modern anxiety and the relentless pace induced by ADHD, the footage is received and processed by Diaa.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaza.mp4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diaa Lagan","original_name":"Diaa Lagan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a916a8beea02e6e8a3f46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5572619,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhannad El-Masri","original_name":"Muhannad El-Masri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a918afbcc2b691738cd40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
