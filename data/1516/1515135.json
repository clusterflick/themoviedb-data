Tchaikovsky and Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Tempest and Romeo and Juliet. Ratmansky forms an abstract ballet out of them, in which narrative motifs appear again and again without following a fixed plot. Instead, overture follows overture - each as a new beginning. The result is a multi-layered dialog between music, literature and dance that questions classical ballet in the here and now.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/z5zlQlbuJbuPsgqrp3CT42VOGtb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayerische Staatsoper","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ratmansky: Tchaikovsky Overtures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5559778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ballett der Bayerischen Staatsoper","original_name":"Ballett der Bayerischen Staatsoper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"687a0c472c5aa3134538cc39","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560564,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexei Ratmansky","original_name":"Alexei Ratmansky","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/sf21FSz9UBLpNfBQOCDXdk5reFW.jpg","credit_id":"687a0be66bf9cee73a55c1a9","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayerische Staatsorchester","original_name":"Bayerische Staatsorchester","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a0c1180aff51a8555c1bd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769707,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikhail Agrest","original_name":"Mikhail Agrest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687a0c24e088d578c78a3e37","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Чайковский","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"687a0c39dff0081dac72bd42","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1008,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16Q4eVl6e12sOpbBbmQLiSzWM07.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1793}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":2791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z5zlQlbuJbuPsgqrp3CT42VOGtb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
