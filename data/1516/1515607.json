Little Hasna is a four year-old girl born totally blind at birth. During her Christmas break, her mother, who works as a maid in town, drops her off at a local garage, under the care of Vellapan and Chacko, the garage workers. Sitting on her designated chair, her only source of entertainment is the sounds echoing from the children playing on the ground ahead. Her zest and fascination for life is communicated through a fly and a cat that are part of her imaginative world. Her perspective of her surrounding and her acute sense of awareness is portrayed subtly through her mature and calm demeanor. In this era of urbanization where the world is fast changing, little Hasna although blind sees the world in her own unique way. She learns to accept the inevitable changes around her and makes us question the colors of the world. An open-ended journey.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Are You Listening?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5573599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hasna aslam","original_name":"Hasna aslam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"687b6a81317a5cfe9cf761be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surjith","original_name":"Surjith","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":"/7OeJm2FBkjvUukvCj5N5WXDw0FN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"687b6ac7268343956855c5ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5573609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sangeetha","original_name":"Sangeetha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"687b6ba138bd91079155c659","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gopalan","original_name":"Gopalan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"687b6dd022c579e4f038d117","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geethu Mohandas","original_name":"Geethu Mohandas","popularity":0.9979,"profile_path":"/6lhzUi7jmEkkUw3BrD6Pqyel00L.jpg","credit_id":"687b6a2e7587c4222af7631d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rajeev Ravi","original_name":"Rajeev Ravi","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/vWAwaO8HkUOXAkCOqlelr5CZrIZ.jpg","credit_id":"687b6a51da3bd92a1a55c746","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2104052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ml","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
