The camera followed her life for four years, including the sudden birth of a child, her husband's betrayal, washing clothes, cooking, harvesting and planting - the normal life wrapped up like raising silkworms and spinning silk. When an epidemic broke out, where should the Burmese women in the village who had no identity like her go? As fate changes, this film also discusses how a group of girls who left their hometowns can have a home and how to be women.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Life Holds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beijing Ethnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
