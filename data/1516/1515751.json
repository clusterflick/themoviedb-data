In this revealing film a dozen people from diverse backgrounds describe how they have struggled with anxiety. Their symptoms cover a wide range from excessive worry, uneasiness and fear, to more extreme symptoms such as compulsive behavior, post-traumatic stress syndrome, phobias, and torturous panic attacks. The film takes you on the crippling ride people with anxiety go on every day. These people are stunted by the fear of what would happen if ... instead of living life. The film explores the unpublicized fact that anxiety is the most treatable form of mental illness. The real-life stories of the people demonstrate how they were able to get on the path to recovery via various therapies.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/tRfCqkjWPD9Cji96UjthRn3CeiF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267905,"logo_path":null,"name":"IronZeal Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's \"Just\" Anxiety","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"It's Just Anxiety","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Polis Schutz","original_name":"Susan Polis Schutz","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/dULE3POGnBBHQM30lSgv8k3kIPI.jpg","credit_id":"687bd35a50eaf6625224408d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Polis Schutz","original_name":"Susan Polis Schutz","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/dULE3POGnBBHQM30lSgv8k3kIPI.jpg","credit_id":"687bd3784993f2496824419f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637949,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bret Granato","original_name":"Bret Granato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bd3917ba2f888ac55c80a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564621,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Bidgood","original_name":"Karen Bidgood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bd39d3628225df7d987d6","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564628,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stephen Schutz","original_name":"Stephen Schutz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687bd3b1a571086a4055c84d","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8390250","wikidata_id":"Q135422048","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tRfCqkjWPD9Cji96UjthRn3CeiF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
