Elijah Moshinsky's critically acclaimed, wittily updated english production for the Australian Opera is a truly theatrical blend of the once-upon-a-time and the here-and-now. Mark Thompson's ingenious designs take the familiar homely objects which furnish Hansel and Gretel's impoverished home and magnify, distort and reorder them in the surreal world in which the children get lost. Irreverent and refreshingly original, this production is an absolute delight with its rare blend of charm and style.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hansel and Gretel - The Australian Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
