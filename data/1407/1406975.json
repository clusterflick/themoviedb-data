An economic, cultural and political crossroads, it served as a model for the “civilizing mission”. Commerce, town planning, education and crossbreeding were the instruments to assimilate populations, establish themselves in the country and exploit the wealth. If some cannot deny history and keep their Saint-Louisian art of living intact, others on the contrary want to put an end to the colonial heritage. For some young people today, it is time to think about history differently. However, everyone has managed to preserve their keen sense of living well together. Saint Louisians and historians tell a rich and complex Waalo saga.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":"/fVlr6EzGAVEyQ7J9mRI6PXhka7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ndar, The Waalo Saga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Mbaye Ousmane","original_name":"William Mbaye Ousmane","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676a224f29783775687ec171","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VWclhV6U4x0Whedc2m3flfWDuP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fVlr6EzGAVEyQ7J9mRI6PXhka7a.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"JCC Carthage Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
