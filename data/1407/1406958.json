Girlhood wit and charm is complemented by more mature reflections of adults who revisit in their childhood memories. Although this rhythmic play is deeply ingrained, traced back to Ancient Egypt and further, its worldly wisdom preserved by generations of girls, stands threatened as technology increasingly impacts our life style globally. Let’s Get the Rhythm is compelling testimony to the value of music in our lives.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kPfnMOHU1js1sUyRC2M4tSfbI9U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let’s Get the Rhythm: The Life and Times of Miss Mary Mack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5138264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Lanzillotto","original_name":"Annie Lanzillotto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"676a11cd010088364b7ebd4d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5138262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Chagall","original_name":"Irene Chagall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676a11adb434251268a9df8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Zeitlin","original_name":"Steven Zeitlin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676a1263010088364b7ebd6f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4712046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kPfnMOHU1js1sUyRC2M4tSfbI9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
