It was the height of the Cold War, and Colonel Shoup was in charge of a radar system built to give early warning of a Soviet attack. To his surprise, it was a call from a child asking to speak to Santa Claus. At StoryCorps, Terri Van Keuren, Rick Shoup, and Pam Farrell—three of Colonel Shoup’s four children—share the tale of what happened next, and how their father created a beloved Christmas Eve tracking tradition.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8GMD5U2TI0FATD4Qu1pUTLqaNsj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A merry mission to track Santa Claus.","title":"Operation North Pole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard O'Connor","original_name":"Richard O'Connor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a97929e0ed83d35cd765","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355057,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Garofalo","original_name":"Michael Garofalo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a9aec7f17205d10afbd2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866971,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jasmyn Morris","original_name":"Jasmyn Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a9b9ad7eebcd755cd1f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046720,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Hartman","original_name":"Rachel Hartman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a9c829e0ed83d35cd775","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866969,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Savannah Winchester","original_name":"Savannah Winchester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a9d6ad7eebcd755cd1fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joshua Abrams","original_name":"Joshua Abrams","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a9eb73da5bccc5c4c93f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136281,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ace & Son Moving Picture Co.","original_name":"Ace & Son Moving Picture Co.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6768a9fe231202807d0b000c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yb94BRk2SvNxTeQG3zeynkDeSJI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8GMD5U2TI0FATD4Qu1pUTLqaNsj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
