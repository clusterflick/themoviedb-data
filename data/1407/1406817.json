By day, he upholds the expectations of his congregation, but his true passion lies in skating through the streets, dreaming of freedom. Inspired by the charm of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and the imaginative escapades of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Tod’s journey takes a turn when he starts offering unconventional, casual wisdom in the confessional booth. His unique approach earns him both admirers and skeptics, ultimately forcing him to balance his faith, his passions, and the expectations of his community.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/h52u3oiV8r75XpE74ZGRAVLVgvG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"in GOD we trust","title":"Preacher","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Zeus","original_name":"John Zeus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tod","credit_id":"6769a869ad7eebcd755cf96d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Mary","original_name":"Ryan Mary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"6769a8a01c54ebfed5c4f906","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Bianchi","original_name":"Frank Bianchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"the boxer","credit_id":"6769abca73da5bccc5c4f018","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neto Queiroz Guedes","original_name":"Neto Queiroz Guedes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"cardinal","credit_id":"6769ac1cad7eebcd755cfa3d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137687,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Queen lizzy","original_name":"Queen lizzy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769a8f746a5a438790b250b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137689,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The British","original_name":"The British","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769a951c9de94d7370b1698","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137692,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Billionare Garfeild","original_name":"Billionare Garfeild","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769a97946a5a438790b2534","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137693,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Molly Percocet","original_name":"Molly Percocet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769a99bc9de94d7370b16b0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"The Ghost of Christmas past","original_name":"The Ghost of Christmas past","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769a9c829e0ed83d35d0b60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Night terrors","original_name":"Night terrors","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769aa2429e0ed83d35d0b85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"The Ghost of Christmas past","original_name":"The Ghost of Christmas past","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769aa34c7f17205d10b1f80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h52u3oiV8r75XpE74ZGRAVLVgvG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
