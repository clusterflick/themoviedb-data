The band's name is a metaphor because just like spring is the time for revival, Gollu revive, reinterpret and develop traditional culture of their nation. The connecting thread of this film is legend about debate of person and devil.

light.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jylmEJyDijQwivkehwhgyBw9BTm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gollu:
