The first performance of the work was in 1970 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In collaboration with his partner Mary Lucier. The piece features Lucier recording himself narrating a text, and then playing the tape recording back into the room while re-recording it. The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Due to the room's particular size and geometry, certain resonant frequencies are emphasized while others are attenuated. Eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the characteristic resonance of the room.","popularity":0.2219,"poster_path":"/53Bp2pfTERNigN5cpvhzJFRbYCq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Sitting in a Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Lucier","original_name":"Alvin Lucier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"676aba7b16fdd844f07eaeb8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Lucier","original_name":"Alvin Lucier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676aba962a8e1b33ea7ed0f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Lucier","original_name":"Alvin Lucier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676abaabfcce39d9ee64b679","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Lucier","original_name":"Alvin Lucier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676abac18594633963a9d84a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/53Bp2pfTERNigN5cpvhzJFRbYCq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":189430,"name":"sound effect"},{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"},{"id":225846,"name":"minimalism"},{"id":243710,"name":"contemporary classical music"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":291381,"name":"sound"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1970-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Alvin Lucier - I Am Sitting In A Room","key":"fAxHlLK3Oyk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-01-24T06:06:43.000Z","id":"676a2a60fe3640664364a10e"}]}}}
