Reimagining a series of one-way conversations with the permanently off-camera Diane, foraged in fragments from the screen of a cathode ray TV - onto an expired Ektachrome 160 super 8 sound cartridge (best before 1990). The film was home-processed, then wrapped in plastic and buried in the woods.  ‘Diane…’ is a collaboration between the original source material, ourselves, the body of the film, and the earth it was buried in.  The soundtrack was recorded directly onto the magnetic strip of the film, firstly in camera, secondly using a super 8 motorised editor, adding to the fragmentation and abstraction of the soundtrack (No additional digital editing has taken place).  The film can be screened in its original form on a sound super 8mm projector, or as a digital video.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Buried and blue","title":"Diane (wrapped in plastic)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Byrne","original_name":"Joanna Byrne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769d327416a3443b5a9db32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Byrne","original_name":"Mark Byrne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769d345b434251268a9d97f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
