The 25-minute film is designed as a tool to demonstrate that the current \"separation of church and state\" is something never intended by the Founding Fathers. It not only surveys the historical statements and records surrounding the original drafting of the First Amendment, but also shows what happened statistically when the 1962 court rejected the Founders' intent. It further shows that the current Court is beginning to return to and uphold many values previously struck down. This mini-doc gives an overview of the Founders' own understanding of the First Amendment and will be helpful to anyone who desires to know the truth about their interpretations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lTPdTHt8HwGhU0Xf9U4vHadLMHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wallbuilders","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Foundations of American Government","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Barton","original_name":"David Barton","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6767436a330bce6ec991173c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Barton","original_name":"David Barton","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67674546330bce6ec9911760","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lTPdTHt8HwGhU0Xf9U4vHadLMHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
