This is an inspiring portrayal of the tactics that gave demonstrators control of the streets, the organizing strategies that enabled the movement to act effectively while remaining leaderless, and the importance of time and space in revolt. It is also a cautionary tale about how the government used the promise of a new constitutional process to recover enough legitimacy to regain control. It chronicles a high point of action in a struggle that continues today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6RmGVs06rVRCqnzWxBdy0V4uisV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fell in Love with Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6RmGVs06rVRCqnzWxBdy0V4uisV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
