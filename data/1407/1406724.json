Most have our name on them... But the most powerful wishes are those that lie in our hearts, and yet belong to someone else. When Lulú notices a troubled bird in the city, she conjures her magical and slightly clumsy, Guardian creature Kino.  Together, they explore solutions in her surreal inner world. But although things dont always go as planned, they discover that small acts of kindness can go a long way in changing the world.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2024-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wishes: Windows & Nests","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5137229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Marí­a Méndez Salgado","original_name":"Ana Marí­a Méndez Salgado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676973ecc7f17205d10b13d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
