The story is embedded in a time of great freedom that is soon crushed - the late 1970s and early '80s: when lives were lived at great volume against a suffocating strain of conservatism and fear. Fraser's adaptation maintains Shakespeare's text but draws on sources beyond Richard II.","popularity":0.6957,"poster_path":"/47rC4bw6HeNrjCb4wSbrOcV7RcB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stratford
