What emerges is a new theory of nonlocal consciousness, rooted in Bohm’s quantum mechanics, explaining how the mind could access information psychically and survive death.  A paradigm-shifting film not seen since the phenomenal success of “The Secret” and “What the Bleep Do We Know.”  Featuring a female PoC cast of experts in physics, neuroscience, Chinese medicine and psychotherapy. In an age of AI, this film reveals how human intelligence is exceptionally different.","popularity":0.6202,"poster_path":"/3Lfsgx4C73Ox6ZwhwJYE9pJiFDp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Psychic Physics LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":248179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vaintino Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thoughts create things, so what creates thoughts?","title":"Playing My Mind's Symphony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffeny Todd","original_name":"Tiffeny Todd","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6768b58b46a5a438790afdaa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Najmeh Hoseini","original_name":"Najmeh Hoseini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6768b5c2ad7eebcd755cd4b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Pluma","original_name":"Gia Pluma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6768b5d2dbea7bbb3fc4d1fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.M.
