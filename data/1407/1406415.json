Some had been shown during Fantastic Gardens, like Fred Herko watering a garbage can. Others were of Steve Paxton and Deborah Hay performing a dance on a golf course at a Country Club. For Judson Fragments, Summers put all of these and many more fragments together, improvising and playing with the means of film as a medium: speed, negatives, overlay etc. Composers Malcolm Goldstein and John Herbert McDowell provided the experimental music. The result is a filmdance, as much a film as a dance experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judson Fragments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5135793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elaine Summers","original_name":"Elaine Summers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67687a5439fec6bcacc4cd09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
