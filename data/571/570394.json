However, it means \"a mess,\" and a mess is just what the happily divorced Martin gets into when he and his ex-wife Brigitte, the mother of his children, rekindle their long-dormant relationship and announce that they intend to move back in together. Not only do the children find this whole thing confusing, but the husband's and the wife's lovers are equally befuddled. Add to that the need for Martin to meet Brigitte's lover and vice-versa, and you have the beginnings of a mess. When it begins to seem to Brigitte's former lover that he has offended the Muslims with a book he translated and he is slated for death, the whole thing grows yet more complicated. In this comedy, this list only scratches the surface of the messes these people must confront.","popularity":0.4229,"poster_path":"/mHlzqacKNbvveiD8r80ZMU6vG9A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Pagaille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rémy Girard","original_name":"Rémy Girard","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/enULDDsKvyNoUCZoFg10Mtq1MFk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"5cb0f357c3a3683c26acba09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Périer","original_name":"François Périer","popularity":0.2882,"profile_path":"/aTgZII5M2ZW936lQJIUh94wQTFV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gabriel","credit_id":"5cb0f36cc3a3683c26acba0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Chesnais","original_name":"Patrick Chesnais","popularity":0.27,"profile_path":"/g0eY9xGHUCIZBJj0QfxNnZQcH98.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jean-Jacques","credit_id":"5cb0f377c3a3683c24ace32e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":402505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clément Thomas","original_name":"Clément Thomas","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/9KXcDGqklhDzd1G6SkrZrVhZSb8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62660c3588b148009feb1672","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Thomas","original_name":"Pascal Thomas","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/333lmUWQatQj3ClLGWGkugtCrY3.jpg","credit_id":"5c2069469251416801c07dad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0102622","wikidata_id":"Q3211290","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mHlzqacKNbvveiD8r80ZMU6vG9A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
