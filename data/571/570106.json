Wayne and Garth. Mike Myers knew his \"Wayne's World\" was big, but it wasn't until Aerosmith came to Saturday Night Live as a musical guest in February 1990 and all but demanded to be included in a WW sketch, that he knew just how big.  Wayne and Garth and Aerosmith.

And, the fact is, they had lost of SNL company. By '89, after three years together, this generation of SNL'ers had rooted a forest of catch phrases and characters into the pop landscape.
