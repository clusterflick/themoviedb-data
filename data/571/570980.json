Thought communicates with the body and writes upon it its own emotions by incessantly retrieving contents from memory. Each body is memory, arranged in so many layers that any act we perform is inevitably connected to memories which conscious thought aims to cancel, though they stay inside the body, unassailable. Whereas mind acts through knowledge and displacement, the body doesn’t forget anything, preserving every event, every thought, every look, every word into its cells. Thus, the idiom of the body is the inexplicable language of memory.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vEmWRPuq1XuJL4OjfnlVXNlD9Gv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Body n.2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleonora Manca","original_name":"Eleonora Manca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c242a26c3a368700bf16016","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vEmWRPuq1XuJL4OjfnlVXNlD9Gv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
