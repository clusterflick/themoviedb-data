When he is granted a twenty-four-hour furlough from prison in order to attend his mother's funeral, he is aware of this and intends to keep out of trouble. Furthermore, he has the same intention for when he finishes his prison term. Thus, his brothers' attempts to get him involved in a really neat theft they have dreamed up do not at first meet with much favor in his eyes. Eventually, their enthusiasm and the almost overwhelming assortment of pleasures they have arranged for him to enjoy soften him up enough for him to cooperate with them. Predictably, things don't go well, but an unsought chance to renew lost love also comes to him at this time, and good fortune finally intervenes on his behalf.","popularity":0.2526,"poster_path":"/bOVHtYgRLsuJLya15evTpzQp4Xv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abracadabra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Volter","original_name":"Philippe Volter","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/64YFCcB1D6FfPV7WE8OTEf2WP2V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Phil","credit_id":"66028bcf459ad60187fbe811","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clémentine Célarié","original_name":"Clémentine Célarié","popularity":0.574,"profile_path":"/6H5PtTuPg9Ud8wLFYcb72EPUHPC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"66028be5b84cdd017df72bd0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Frémont","original_name":"Thierry Frémont","popularity":0.3192,"profile_path":"/yUwC2WiydDrCy5TL7xOjdP1PXjM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"66028c3a60620a01632a7446","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Cleven","original_name":"Harry Cleven","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/dYVRKzN9mSUMaE1UJx8FD9gUh5x.jpg","credit_id":"5c215c25c3a368700beca32b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103611","wikidata_id":"Q16525121","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.619,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bOVHtYgRLsuJLya15evTpzQp4Xv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
