After having unscrupulously infiltrated the action, the producer, confusing fiction and reality, tries to hijack the investigation for his own benefit. Entangled in their investigation, but true to their role, the actors thwart the producer's schemes and then look for a financing solution themselves to bring the film to a successful conclusion.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":"/pMGkeXEvDyIO7YevSmGPTl2MGYa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le roman d'un truqueur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":586758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Orry","original_name":"Marie-Christine Orry","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":"/nSo8Bqm6mGGRC7LsfLRGIxYP2lS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6268ba7c5ab81a132e1ea1ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Maître","original_name":"Bernard Maître","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6268ba96eda4b7177d8dbfcf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Dopff","original_name":"Paul Dopff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6268baad64f716160d0ddf7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Martin","original_name":"Gérard Martin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63aad255be4b36008a6babb3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2201344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Dopff","original_name":"Paul Dopff","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c21bbdb0e0a264ddbeee3e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0257048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pMGkeXEvDyIO7YevSmGPTl2MGYa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
