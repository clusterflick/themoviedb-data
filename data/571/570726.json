She is awakened from this dulled state by news that she only has a year to live. Thus, when she sees an interesting man with a lively appearance during a visit to the library, she decides to try and track him down, perhaps to arrange for a sitting. It turns out that the man is a serial killer, but, given her short life-span, this knowledge does not prevent Anne from developing a relationship with him, though she is understandably skittish around him.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dusk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Carcélès","original_name":"Laurent Carcélès","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc2f8960cde00516f80ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Carcélès","original_name":"Laurent Carcélès","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc2f1414291009211a084","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435367,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anick Baly","original_name":"Anick Baly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc304d2b20902f59f80e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1768296,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maurice Giraud","original_name":"Maurice Giraud","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc2fe55c1f4008be8bac5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3493749,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carmen Arbues-Miro","original_name":"Carmen Arbues-Miro","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adc3134142910051c8d024","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896282,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Lecoeur","original_name":"Philippe Lecoeur","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ws1TRCaky5XwQZrhOFZA77IfZU.jpg","credit_id":"62adc3205b12400360ff9844","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Carcélès","original_name":"Laurent Carcélès","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c22b065c3a3686fffee2935","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106491","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
