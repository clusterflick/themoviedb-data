The Circuit Carole of the title refers to a motorbike racetrack. Jeanne and her 20-year old daughter Marie share a small apartment in a working-class Parisian neighborhood; the two live harmoniously, but the daughter is restless and anxious to set out on her own. Marie then takes a job in a northern suburb and their lives are forever changed. The racetrack is near her work; Marie is enthralled by the racers and their fast machines. Along with her new boyfriend, a racer, Marie begins riding herself. She then moves out of her mother's flat, leaving Jeanne bereft of companionship and a purpose in her life. Her silent, deeply internalized grief eventually drives her completely mad.","popularity":0.2022,"poster_path":"/65fb0CynexVZkaZlLpRtLyUg4ox.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circuit Carole","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bulle Ogier","original_name":"Bulle Ogier","popularity":0.5224,"profile_path":"/lS4b8sdG6u2IBo7cBPTqNSqAq2O.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jeanne","credit_id":"5de5da120cd44600123cbc32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Côte","original_name":"Laurence Côte","popularity":0.2029,"profile_path":"/9Ze7vTkIm2X5TU48itFgRj4HWFO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"5de5da18a7e36300146f2287","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Pierrot","original_name":"Frédéric Pierrot","popularity":0.3736,"profile_path":"/rMC51zZ11vrpP4Hu0R23tvcSrOk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alexandre","credit_id":"5de5da1e0cd44600123cbc49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Cuau","original_name":"Bernard Cuau","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jeanne's colleague","credit_id":"5de5da243faba0001911253c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Bekhaled","original_name":"Omar Bekhaled","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Apprentice","credit_id":"5de5da2b3faba00013104e02","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":577428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emmanuelle Cuau ","original_name":"Emmanuelle Cuau","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c243aa90e0a264dd8f28de4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":577428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emmanuelle Cuau ","original_name":"Emmanuelle Cuau","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de5da3dcf4b8b001825b1a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38397,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arlette Langmann","original_name":"Arlette Langmann","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de5da370cd44600193c8fa1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51114,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabelle Devinck","original_name":"Isabelle Devinck","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/gbvskViLsPIeESPOg8gjAkGKEQ1.jpg","credit_id":"5de5da523faba00015118238","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21655,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Benoît Delhomme","original_name":"Benoît Delhomme","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/qa2h6tyIG4iIc700VN7acYnhU4v.jpg","credit_id":"5de5da4aa7e36300146f22c2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109436","wikidata_id":"Q16539964","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/imhu79SF5ktBIIPdt0R67MsQGsg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9m3mrbnosbwJVlfMwbOji6wOtOO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/65fb0CynexVZkaZlLpRtLyUg4ox.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
