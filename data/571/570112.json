He is part of a generation that longs for a more than a traditional “nine-to-five”. But is a life devoted to art and creativity actually plausible? His parents don’t seem to think so. In an unprecedented interview with legendary contemporary artist Zhang Huan, Harry is exposed to just how corrupt and bias the art world is.
