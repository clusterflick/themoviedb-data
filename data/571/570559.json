Or is he just a very emaciated, very strange and possibly quite lonely young man from an Arabic country with an obsession with death? On the other hand, why is the previously cheery Parisian teenager Nathalie Belfond throwing fits and speaking in Arabic? Her strange behavior began with the appearance of a caped and cadaverous man outside her window. Mr. & Mrs. Belfond have their hands full trying to sort this mess out, in this extremely unusual and award-winning comedy which puts a new wrinkle on the vampire mythos.","popularity":0.1386,"poster_path":"/pe9xdGibbNuGJRsDcvaYd62rdNa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale de Gestion Cinématographique (SGGC)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":91629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Auramax","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Vampire in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Cremer","original_name":"Bruno Cremer","popularity":0.5739,"profile_path":"/nJKNyrnUKN3WtbX4ERaShXVkBsd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Antoine Belfond","credit_id":"6268c0a2c613ce0050310d15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Fossey","original_name":"Brigitte Fossey","popularity":0.6242,"profile_path":"/vcMSPUOgpQpNG6dHIkImd1Nq632.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Belfond","credit_id":"6268c0ab12aabc0067a9eb4a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Marsac","original_name":"Laure Marsac","popularity":0.3156,"profile_path":"/sCz2f69Q2ummSuKDOD6XURsfiG1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nathalie Belfond","credit_id":"6268c0b464f716160f8e2a43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farid Chopel","original_name":"Farid Chopel","popularity":0.2092,"profile_path":"/rvRxRJo6bBT2vO6abg5e5YUpHvo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Arbi Nosfer","credit_id":"6268c0ba1967570051a31a04","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdelkrim Bahloul","original_name":"Abdelkrim Bahloul","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/nRujpXoaCXlx6IzDT1RabHmc9nV.jpg","credit_id":"5c2157e20e0a264de1ee0726","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0105683","wikidata_id":"Q17640245","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.732,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pe9xdGibbNuGJRsDcvaYd62rdNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":732}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
