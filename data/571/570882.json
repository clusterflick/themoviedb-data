Even today, the inhabitants sometimes hear the cruel laments of the tortured ... but it is especially foreigners, passing through the region, who would have the most to fear ...  Broadcast on TV at the end of 2009 and published on DVD in March 2010, MONOROI is a horrific drama that does not play in the category of many DTVs that abound (pollute?) In Japan. Far from being broke, MONOROI even allows the presence of some actors known in the casting.","popularity":1.1107,"poster_path":"/7jYSjAa80qgLyqBXwuvwnMSPZxM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monoroi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"物呪～モノロイ～","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"物呪～モノロイ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yûji Tanaka","original_name":"田中裕二","popularity":0.8239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b69dc3a3683782eaa333","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuki Tanimura","original_name":"谷村美月","popularity":0.7214,"profile_path":"/xV9UrP8kZdxOiTI2efDFhp3t4iA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b6b30e0a264de6f1ad62","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroki Narimiya","original_name":"成宮寛貴","popularity":0.6292,"profile_path":"/vSQJ51HUdoeEDCW5J18BD8VwzMM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b6c49251416801c5087d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":990166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mai Nishida","original_name":"西田麻衣","popularity":0.2517,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b6e30e0a26309af0e5d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naruse Hirotaka","original_name":"Naruse Hirotaka","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b70a0e0a264df2f182ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2202248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shûhei Shimada","original_name":"島田秀平","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b74792514167fbc54e8a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomu Suetaka","original_name":"Tomu Suetaka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b7689251414c16c49e7b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryô Morishita","original_name":"Ryô Morishita","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b77d0e0a264dedf1b212","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teyu Kon","original_name":"Teyu Kon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c23b7ab0e0a26309af0e72c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoji Tanaka","original_name":"田中要次","popularity":0.823,"profile_path":"/752oL9YrUumjrqbhdj4GNJ938x3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6493ac8daf6e9400c8bf24f9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurokawa Takashi","original_name":"Kurokawa Takashi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c23b5dd0e0a264de1f1a0dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurokawa Takashi","original_name":"Kurokawa Takashi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c23b6729251416e80c083a9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9499452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/7jYSjAa80qgLyqBXwuvwnMSPZxM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156580,"name":"ghost story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
