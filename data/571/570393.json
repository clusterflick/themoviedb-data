It is divided in six episodes following an ancient Indian text, Katha Upanishad, in which a youth, Nakiketa, converses with Death. Every section presents an event of that day and refers to a writer and a painter. The film captures some of the excitement of Spring 1968 in Europe and elsewhere.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/soB8dpR3Xt6tiiDJJKqyi2IvDOp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"200 Feet for March 31st","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrizio Buccarella","original_name":"Fabrizio Buccarella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f864cf66082eb0036f5c81e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvano Fua","original_name":"Silvano Fua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f864cfea1a9ba00384150a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Costanzo Lemmi","original_name":"Costanzo Lemmi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f864d06afe22400381b0159","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Onorati","original_name":"Laura Onorati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f864d10a199a60035de8997","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Velasquez","original_name":"Janet Velasquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f864d1a2d8ef30039bbe127","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Massimo Bacigalupo","original_name":"Massimo Bacigalupo","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/hJAZaLr6oSH7hrOZMRCUi1PQTEm.jpg","credit_id":"5c2066e1c3a3681c34ea8a23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efAxSQ7Gx5n9qLGnvPWeSxkx4vC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/5hPd29Qdn4qUACZWAy3xOu5e1qX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyEgfvE9P56R75W4uNwzu5VS2SZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/soB8dpR3Xt6tiiDJJKqyi2IvDOp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Institute for Research in Art & Technology, London","release_date":"1970-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":" Filmstudio 70, Rome","release_date":"1968-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Torino Film Festival","release_date":"2010-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"200 Feet for March 31st (1968) by Massimo Bacigalupo","key":"KFFSg6dUmac","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-06-12T09:28:49.000Z","id":"5fba069fe2bca80040f9ce9c"}]}}}
