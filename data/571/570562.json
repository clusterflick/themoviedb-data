They evolve in a world whose rules seem to them as many constraints and adopt unusual behaviors which can disorientate their interlocutors. They say they are brother and sister and many people prefer to believe them and be satisfied with this version for fear of supporting a situation that is too scabrous.

Her taste for derision and her humor allow her to overcome the provocations of the couple and to take an ascendancy on them.","popularity":0.1578,"poster_path":"/3BJ8fjWXf5rxoGLiXIaatoePJSB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vincennes Neuilly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Étesse","original_name":"Philippe Étesse","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jérôme","credit_id":"6268adc1ea37e0006a76b03e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":262960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Kessler","original_name":"Anne Kessler","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/8uQwzp7p9cXduFJ1TdQ4jC0THGA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"6268adcb001bbd154b2b165d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Brion","original_name":"Françoise Brion","popularity":0.1972,"profile_path":"/qfRTyNeFFleaYkpSkX7Zplutulm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"6268add6614c6d009ab634f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Garcin","original_name":"Henri Garcin","popularity":0.161,"profile_path":"/kp0kqzRMT9c50UuKFkxqIdOgOTW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jacques","credit_id":"6268adddeda4b7177d8d7f20","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":24719,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pierre Dupouey","original_name":"Pierre Dupouey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2159ef0e0a26309aedd579","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0253900","wikidata_id":"Q28494008","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3BJ8fjWXf5rxoGLiXIaatoePJSB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
