This is played (generally in the southern part of the country) with steel balls on a packed-earth court. While these games have a bucolic, countrified and even genteel air about them, competition and betting are fierce. In this sports/crime thriller, a young man whose father was killed for violating the unspoken roles of the game in professional competition trains with his grandfather to become a champion boules player just like his father.","popularity":0.2006,"poster_path":"/yqzXUPSToYe2H3tVw1EjwDxpe9p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ellepi
