The processing of the image surface emphasizes the materiality of the medium, and turns the medium of film itself into a subject. This film even undermines the essential characteristic of the medium – the sequence of single images that suggests movement – by also showing the filmstrip itself. The cinematic illusion is broken, and at the same time it is shown as film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dbQN3TGGwSI285j5K3dRywHN2Kd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniël Singelenberg","original_name":"Daniël Singelenberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c206b66c3a3686fffead2bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbQN3TGGwSI285j5K3dRywHN2Kd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
