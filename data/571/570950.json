JB, an academic famed for his studies of oriental culture and alcoholic who has never recovered from his wife's suicide, returns to Sri Lanka to translate a book written on glass. It is supposed to contain Buddha's discourse upon memory. While he is there, an attractive nurse, Julia asks him to assist a young boy who wants to locate his father who is now living in a Tamil-occupied area. The Tamil terrorists will kill any trespassers. Compounding JB's conflict in deciding to go is that his former home where he lived with his wife is in that area. Unbeknownst to him, the boy is really a Tamil spy.","popularity":0.2811,"poster_path":"/nVMHqX2LevWhpsUMkgTOH9sUsTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madragoa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":69232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Light Night","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1245,"logo_path":"/suKdkPTtHn0DzGYmrXCA506dJON.png","name":"TSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1994-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crystal Book","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Balmer","original_name":"Jean-François Balmer","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/5CLhlqqDJMjTx8t9ZkAyNwRBzQR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Billeter, aka JB","credit_id":"6270a75c8c7b0f00a1fd27b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","original_name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","popularity":0.595,"profile_path":"/ioMCjkUWngWjS0nXWYLqvBsm4mI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julia Portal","credit_id":"6270a76772d855009c5650be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Ranasinghe","original_name":"Douglas Ranasinghe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Siri de Silva","credit_id":"6270a77084f2490050d6adf6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gamini Fonseka","original_name":"Gamini Fonseka","popularity":0.1902,"profile_path":"/2H514spPaNRBqKm2KqwN3u9RFm9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"S.S.P.
