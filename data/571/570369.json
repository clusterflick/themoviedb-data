In a belated attempt to connect with her roots, she rushes to the cemetary and joins a funeral gathering. She gets to know the people at the ceremony and is soon embroiled in an art smuggling scheme and has some (probably incestuous) romantic feelings for a young man she believes may be her brother. Eventually she finds out that she went to the wrong part of the cemetary and that these people are not her kin.","popularity":0.1157,"poster_path":"/e8wRq2vY3i1YJgOy6gTGWpoRlAW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pentimento","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1949826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Dinev","original_name":"Patricia Dinev","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6263646b7caa4714b3497c89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine de Caunes","original_name":"Antoine de Caunes","popularity":0.2471,"profile_path":"/oyjKEcH72HfCAEe4M0Z3933NCFv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62636476e18b97005051d065","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magali Noël","original_name":"Magali Noël","popularity":0.2911,"profile_path":"/mEFJnEVJ3MVOFrQLD40a8HMPr4O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62636481e61e6d0050074ca9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence César","original_name":"Laurence César","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6263648ff48e0d0051acbef3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonie Marshall","original_name":"Tonie Marshall","popularity":0.1869,"profile_path":"/urtlFI9YSRQKytvYeFXxCo9Ep55.jpg","credit_id":"5c203cb892514167fbc06a00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098076","wikidata_id":"Q3374944","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e8wRq2vY3i1YJgOy6gTGWpoRlAW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
