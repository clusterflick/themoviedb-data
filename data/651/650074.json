Plus the fact that the two lead characters are portrayed by top singers in their absolute prime - both Gruberova and Araiza weren't even 35 years old at the time of this performance, makes this production the most convincing both dramatically and musically.  The conducting of Fischer is good - he makes the music come alive, much more so than the MET version.","popularity":0.0803,"poster_path":"/aAPnxVZrGwruLKitKup3O0DsepB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche
