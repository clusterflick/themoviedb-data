At the invitation of filmmaker Lana Lin, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, twenty-seven writers, artists, activists, health care advocates, and current and former patients recite Lorde’s manifesto aloud on camera, collectively dramatizing it and producing an oration for the screen. The film is both a critical commentary and a poetic reflection upon the precarious conditions of survival within the intimate and politicized public sphere of illness.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":"/wRU5qGh0VDETa4b9J4DxrwOW9Qj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cancer Journals Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1690456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lana Lin","original_name":"Lana Lin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd8775b3faba00015f9e9fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.686,"height":2191,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wRU5qGh0VDETa4b9J4DxrwOW9Qj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
