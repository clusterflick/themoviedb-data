We meet scientists who changed the world, like Faraday, Franklin, and Tesla and we glimpse the future, as Solar Impulse becomes the first plane to complete a round-the-world flight powered only by the sun. With a mix of chalk animation, CGI, archival footage and spectacular aerials, the film also explores the challenges ahead: how to meet the growing energy needs of our industrialized world, while also protecting the health of our planet.","popularity":0.1394,"poster_path":"/wc4wrt2MMAap1Xye1mZb24DPLPT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10159,"logo_path":null,"name":"nWave Pictures","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet Power","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Full Charge - The Power of Innovation","type":"early title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Icarus' Revenge","type":"early title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Solar Impulse 3D","type":"early title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583893,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronan Chapalain","original_name":"Ronan Chapalain","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d79a6eb14fa002a7aaf0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pascal Vuong","original_name":"Pascal Vuong","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d79bfdb952d008a5c3e52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8163040","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2033,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wc4wrt2MMAap1Xye1mZb24DPLPT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1355}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
