Conceptually speculating from sixteen years in the future (and a protracted civil war), the project is partly nostalgic political travelogue, partly a quest to mine the archive for what went wrong, and part prewar surveillance records, the project deconstructs and builds to a clashing ideology, culminating in an installation of sound sculpture, four-walled video and artifacts.","popularity":0.206,"poster_path":"/nRvxDpLDh40RqaEpmhMikj8PhxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corporation of Yaddo","origin_country":""},{"id":138188,"logo_path":null,"name":"MacDowell Colony","origin_country":""},{"id":138189,"logo_path":null,"name":"iPark Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":138190,"logo_path":null,"name":"SPACE Gallery","origin_country":""},{"id":138191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purchase College Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CIVIL WAR SURVEILLANCE POEMS (Part 1)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitch McCabe","original_name":"Mitch McCabe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9d4bf8e2e000011eeeaef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitch McCabe","original_name":"Mitch McCabe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2ab0a73e09f3003524ff9a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732296,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amy Wesson","original_name":"Amy Wesson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2ab17ea698cf00325369ed","department":"Editing","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kyra Lyons","original_name":"Kyra Lyons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2ab1a679a1c3003630b41a","department":"Editing","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732297,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maggie Millian","original_name":"Maggie Millian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2ab19379a1c3003730fe0b","department":"Editing","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin T.
