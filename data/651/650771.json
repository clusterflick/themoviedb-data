In this DVD of Katie Mitchell’s sometimes radical production of Lucia di Lammermoor from London’s Royal Opera House, she is, as the Financial Times wrote, “brilliantly convincing”. The British award winning director Katie Mitchell – took a revisionist approach to the drama, updating the action to the mid-19th century and applying a feminist slant as she added new and unexpected elements. The Financial Times wrote: “Mitchell shows us on stage personal traumas that a self-respecting woman in the early 19th century was meant to keep to herself. It is a messy, bloody list — nocturnal sex trysts, a knife murder, a miscarriage, a suicide in the bath … In all this Damrau is brilliantly convincing. Her rebellious Lucia is a woman of modern attitudes stuck in a still feudal Victorian world.”","popularity":0.1593,"poster_path":"/oilmRXudPKgazAfLYotx9UTS9ap.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erato","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucia di Lammermoor","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":531150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Damrau","original_name":"Diana Damrau","popularity":0.1798,"profile_path":"/bJBoCUq9h2vspP3l13l9hJG1GaE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"5ddafc348e2e000013f10998","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Castronovo","original_name":"Charles Castronovo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/kH3RqNqHPkwywWxysQLxw2Y3Vsb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edgardo","credit_id":"5ddafc484284ea0011f6d8d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/u9OD8isxAGK1oLJBs2HSHFCYo07.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Enrico","credit_id":"5ddafc6912aabc0013945c24","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lloyd","original_name":"Robert Lloyd","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/39hqwFKidqj2K97pEmRMSjwzrzf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alisa","credit_id":"5ddafca93faba00015fef0ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwangchul Youn","original_name":"Kwangchul Youn","popularity":0.1001,"profile_path":"/7RZfJCEh0zUq2TnyV6zr5eOzoSe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Raimondo","credit_id":"5ddb129f4284ea0017f6fd1f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Stayton","original_name":"Taylor Stayton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lord Arturo","credit_id":"5ddb12be4284ea0011f6ef84","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hoare","original_name":"Peter Hoare","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/aE6z4tLrTXpTFq8gGCk0ZZg3EI3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Normanno","credit_id":"5ddb12d53faba00019ff3680","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Oren","original_name":"Daniel Oren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iy7Q72UxuaZ2MCSSHzojVFtuzdq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5ddb12e94284ea0017f6fd51","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Mitchell","original_name":"Katie Mitchell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddb13283faba00019ff37b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382767,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salvadore Cammarano","original_name":"Salvadore Cammarano","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddb13a93faba00015ff137c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Williams","original_name":"Margaret Williams","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddb13610cd44600142acad0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5ddb13764284ea0017f6fde7","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12839130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oilmRXudPKgazAfLYotx9UTS9ap.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
