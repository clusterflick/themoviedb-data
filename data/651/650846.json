Vladimir Jurowski and his absolutely brilliant Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give us a new reading of old favorites that may well blow you out of your chair. There is plenty to discover: sounds and textures never heard before, an orchestral timbre as the composer himself may have envisaged and heard, incredible strength and cohesion and, on the other hand, sensitive nuances that often disappear under a blanket of massed strings in more traditional interpretations.","popularity":0.19,"poster_path":"/iF6xUlD1eu9XMZ82clK3CcUFW9U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 4 & 7; Coriolan Overture","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1561175,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Jurowski","original_name":"Vladimir Jurowski","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ddb425d0cd44600142b24b6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","original_name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/bSyMM4Y7qWLKMvDuynPJ3mn3Pup.jpg","credit_id":"5ddb43754284ea0011f75c42","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Simonnet","original_name":"Olivier Simonnet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddb4366a8067300171078cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iF6xUlD1eu9XMZ82clK3CcUFW9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
