Rui Silveira films this tradition in his birthplace, taking us on a trip out of time. Capturing the smallest details, he conveys the patience and skill that go into a beautiful ephemeral art that brings the community’s spirit to life; meanwhile, questions related to rurality and exile keep cropping up in the conversations. The fragility of the paper flowers, threatened as much by the weather as by souvenir-hungry tourists, is a window on an ages-old world struggling to protect its integrity.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/oad87l6EFTJ6cYje8xZen92JhuZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Os Olhos Do Meu Amor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les yeux de mon amour","type":"Français"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rui Silveira","original_name":"Rui Silveira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9a7e10cd4460014285476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rui Silveira","original_name":"Rui Silveira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de1533ca24c50001732d38a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843455,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mariana Veloso","original_name":"Mariana Veloso","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de15322dcb6a300116bd780","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rui Silveira","original_name":"Rui Silveira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de153323faba0001308a02f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"olhosamor","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oad87l6EFTJ6cYje8xZen92JhuZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":671}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
