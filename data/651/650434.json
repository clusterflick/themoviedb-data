[Woman, You Are Beauty!] was a silent film made in Rosario, Argentina. Premiered on 24 March 1928 in one of the city's most important opera houses, with a live orchestra and a model posing on stage, it became a box-office success. (The same would happen in Buenos Aires, where the film was shown a few months later).  Its creator, the Italian-born Argentine Camilo Zaccaría Soprani, was a well-known entertainment journalist in the city. But he would only acknowledge his authorship in an interview forty years later. Most of the film is lost. Only a ten minute fragment survives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jFmaqGlqRbsidgCgOjHUCmoKVfn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1928-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¡Mujer, tú eres la belleza!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilo Zaccaría Soprani","original_name":"Camilo Zaccaría Soprani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9caab8e2e000013eecbaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/jFmaqGlqRbsidgCgOjHUCmoKVfn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.686,"height":2104,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dPoZEfp7iupB3BPWMSvFPHB76d0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1444}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1928-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
