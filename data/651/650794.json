Their connection is palpable, leaving the viewer envisioning a possible real life encounter between the two outside of the realm of this project.  One on One is a series of video dialogues between the inmates at California Institution for Men in Chino, California, the members of the Church in Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California, and a group of Crenshaw residents in Los Angeles, California. One on One was produced while Wendy Clarke was the artist-in-residence at the California Institution for Men in Chino, California. The series uses the medium of video as a means to form relationships between people who would otherwise never get a chance to communicate with each other.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One on One: Ken and Louise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy Clarke","original_name":"Wendy Clarke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddb0c710cd44600142ac2e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
