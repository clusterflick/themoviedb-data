I filmed and edited the video in three parts. I came up with the next video from the first edited video and filmed the second video, and then came up with the third video from the second edited video. It took me a year to complete it, but it felt like a year of struggling to write a haiku. I used natural sounds recorded live on location without editing, but it was strange how they somehow matched the edited footage as if they were calculated.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7tT7XwDFXh6faZZyaxW3wUSVIku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Stepping","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kagefumi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kota","original_name":"Isao Kota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddaccb70cd44600122a2e66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kota","original_name":"Isao Kota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f40bdc1bb0472899996fea","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kota","original_name":"Isao Kota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f40bea7b43bdce20ad4649","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tT7XwDFXh6faZZyaxW3wUSVIku.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tADZ9u7Nm3RhzLbkCo88UeyYUsX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AFxG14jqnIvnHP9Q2d3VAIjBCp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
