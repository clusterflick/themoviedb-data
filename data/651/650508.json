This film of a conceptual artist's work is a document of Skyworks but also meant to be expressive as an art film. A film of meditation revealing the cosmic breath as Skyworks pieces fall at the rate of 120 to 135 miles per hour. A breathing language of light and knowledge. Performance-controlled flight. Gyres cycling in and out - the mystic spiral. A perception of light and space as energy lines alter the environment temporarily.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vlIqe4co0JwUw6ZR41ZWfYVizqb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skyworks: \"Wind + Fire\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"LeAnn Bartok","original_name":"LeAnn Bartok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dda05c43faba00015fd5896","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vlIqe4co0JwUw6ZR41ZWfYVizqb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
