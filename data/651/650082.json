Fragments of bone or fabric placed inside a bejewelled shrine, a sculpted golden head or even a life-sized silver hand were, and still are, objects of religious devotion believed to have the power to work miracles. The documentary features interviews with art historian Sister Wendy Beckett and Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum.","popularity":0.5799,"poster_path":"/5aXhHVUyXg8QDcoAVSs61CKmKQX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treasures of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"上天的财富","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","original_name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/jOSkqBq9pJHz49P4906AdRMgGXl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dd866973faba00013fa0b4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2095717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sister Wendy Beckett","original_name":"Sister Wendy Beckett","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/hXg36J3DPc8O2P5XVQlqEt4LRb7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5dd866c8ef8b3200188c1102","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil MacGregor","original_name":"Neil MacGregor","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5df6d107ba131b09b1c6c151","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tilzey","original_name":"Paul Tilzey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd868e128723c00145590f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1976644","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5aXhHVUyXg8QDcoAVSs61CKmKQX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161935,"name":"relic"},{"id":170648,"name":"religious art"},{"id":237586,"name":"christian relic"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":253509,"name":"religious belief"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2011-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
