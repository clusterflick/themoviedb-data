Intercut with scenes from her earlier films\r produced over 20 years, this film explores the changes the Maasai have been\r forced to make. Her focus is again on the women of this pastoral village as they\r discuss their socially and politically inferior status in relation to myth and the\r practicalities of everyday life. Her women friendsâ€™ stories are woven into a\r lyrical, moving, complex and personal film on the nature of memory and of\r dreams.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories and Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Llewelyn-Davies","original_name":"Melissa Llewelyn-Davies","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dda8df612aabc001193769b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
