The upper portion of the poster is painted over with the title of the film and the lower with the name of the filmmaker. The poster shows the beautiful and complacent face of a woman, at its center her large Asian eyes, a deep and trusting gaze. A hand reaches into the image – probably that of a man – trailing a long transparent strip across the poster.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Life Is Worth Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friedl vom Gröller","original_name":"Friedl vom Gröller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zcZlEUNeMXRnJWPLKkwTqKxKva2.jpg","credit_id":"5dd9e6133faba00015fd1124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
