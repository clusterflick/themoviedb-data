It is based on the novel of the same name by Bharathi Sutha. This was the first movie of the director duo without Dr. Rajkumar in the lead. The film starred Anant Nag, Kalpana, and K. S. Ashwath. It was a musical blockbuster with all the songs composed by Rajan–Nagendra considered evergreen hits. Bayalu Daari was the first commercial success for Anant Nag who had earlier done art films and established himself as a leading star in the Kannada cinema with a chocolate hero image. This film was one the last big hits of Kalpana. The helicopter scenes formed a major highlight of the movie.","popularity":0.3489,"poster_path":"/yhNcT1f2DbHlgfNvZ6adxkYRqJR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anupam Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1976-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Unforgettable Tunes, Timeless Love: A Cinematic Masterpiece\"","title":"Bayaludaari","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anant Nag","original_name":"Anant Nag","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/4XeYuoZX15cks43HRavV75RjlmN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gopinath","credit_id":"66a11820e225e242da14b3b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalpana","original_name":"Kalpana","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/bppTr79gGkKWOicZmaRUheK5nhi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chandra","credit_id":"66a1182de72a2e874ba0a7b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashok","original_name":"Ashok","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/lTuXlmdtRH25YWznb7LJDLbypFb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Raja","credit_id":"66a11837fadd7c4c9c3821d0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.
