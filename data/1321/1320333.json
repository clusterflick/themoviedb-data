On the brink of madness, Emily is haunted by lurking malevolent forces, her only hope, the desperate belief her missing father could save her from this living hell. But as she longs for his return, Emily is tormented by visions of a sinister, gnarled black handâ€”a spectre haunting her earliest memories. It is a homage to the unsettling atmosphere of 1950s horror cinema, echoing the terror of THE HAUNTING and the ghostly dread of THE INNOCENTS.","popularity":0.4136,"poster_path":"/baO09nMdfGUd4rhmtXqUB0GV3Jg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sixty6media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fright","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3029573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwyneth
