Because of this, he sometimes gets into trouble. Mom is not always able to contain his ebullient energy. He loves his mother very much, loves to have breakfast with her, do exercises, walks and go on rides in the park... But when she is at work, Philip often runs away from home to the nearest coffee shop and watches how coffee is made. Here he has his own life, his own rules and his own dream - Philip wants to become a barista, because coffee makes people happier!
