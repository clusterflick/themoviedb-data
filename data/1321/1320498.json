Stephanie is a young girl with a gift for the sciences. But despite her aptitudes and intelligence, she is unable to make a place for herself in the misogynous and phallocratic world of a university.  She nevertheless helps her mentor, Professor Beaumont, to develop a prototype time machine. Unfortunately, the demonstration in the university laboratories proves disastrous. Rector Fenwick fires Professor Beaumont, which further humiliates Stephanie.  However, she does manage to resolve the issues with the prototype in a second time machine built at Beaumont’s home. With the Rector and the members of his Committee coming to witness a final demonstration, Stephanie will, in her own way, avenge herself from her detractors. A TIME OF MICE AND HUBRIS is Quebec's first steampunk film.","popularity":0.4026,"poster_path":"/jUBqUThRNZWLXp1KOb1U4x6dRnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Ecranhia","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Time of Mice and Hubris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mylène St-Sauveur","original_name":"Mylène St-Sauveur","popularity":0.2391,"profile_path":"/spEa4VaEEkTsE5PXSyVuO4U2bB5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stephanie","credit_id":"66a00ef55e763212640a6a2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Leclerc","original_name":"Vincent Leclerc","popularity":0.5015,"profile_path":"/sCNPUiSUQs1kfurlDXm8qgjQ8Mj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Recteur Fenwick","credit_id":"66a00f13773aa3d19598ff20","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Baby","original_name":"Patrick Baby","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/4WKEf7U7hQtZyD61T0UlvyjYeEx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66a00f46527c1a49a1faa045","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Perron","original_name":"Michel Perron","popularity":0.1582,"profile_path":"/uRSJnvcmA8WOC4FFwv8Iz7bRs3T.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66a00f5abf6f2ef35abf40dd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Beaupré","original_name":"Jean-François Beaupré","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/iMID2957kyN2YPbhzKQ2zznPI7l.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66a00f69a72fe811d952d18f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Xavier","original_name":"Olivier Xavier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a00e9ccc8765450252d1b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Xavier","original_name":"Olivier Xavier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a00ed1306f1d2c74cdd3a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175360,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean Fugazza","original_name":"Jean Fugazza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a00ee129c93887b05276ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Baby","original_name":"Patrick Baby","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/4WKEf7U7hQtZyD61T0UlvyjYeEx.jpg","credit_id":"66a00f345ab8c7acc9cdd411","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064756,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amélie Douville","original_name":"Amélie Douville","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a00f82efc00151a2faa062","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31389797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUBqUThRNZWLXp1KOb1U4x6dRnl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10028,"name":"steampunk"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Fantasia Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
