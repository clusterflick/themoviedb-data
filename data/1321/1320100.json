Each month there is a different story, told in rhyming couplets and highlighting changes in the countryside through the year. An interview with Emma twenty-six years on adds a poignant postscript to her adventures as a child. The series will be particularly useful to primary teachers.  Six-year-old Emma lives with her mother in the country. Whenever she can, she visits her Grandpa and his dog, Cindy, who live in an old cottage not far away. For a few moments in each story you can eavesdrop on their conversation as they explore the woods and fields near their homes and discover all sorts of things about the countryside as it changes through the twelve months of the year.","popularity":0.3679,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emma and Grandpa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Emma and Grandpa Adventures on the Farm","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Helmer","original_name":"Emma Helmer","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"669edf7f30e5816181e5316f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Mason","original_name":"Alan Mason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Grandpa","credit_id":"669edfad1819b19f3647a982","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelley Winters","original_name":"Shelley Winters","popularity":0.9442,"profile_path":"/nCWHQ21r83JmcEVEvOAIzUyiuBh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (US)","credit_id":"669ee10417018ff37add882d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1935838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Samira Ahmed","original_name":"Samira Ahmed","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":"/fXo2PH8sxm9J1lUdvObuaSJquz0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"669ee1d59b8e53c6a78efff4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thora Hird","original_name":"Thora Hird","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/bz4AXWd9k7mrFPGi5eImfZxZwN2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (UK)","credit_id":"669ee664ffec41ea134be871","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1235324,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joy Whitby","original_name":"Joy Whitby","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ee01625507a8c860a4428","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1235324,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joy Whitby","original_name":"Joy Whitby","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ee0422bada0e7a86e57d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1235324,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joy Whitby","original_name":"Joy Whitby","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ee05513a87163eca89392","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844336,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Hartley","original_name":"Robert Hartley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ee2195dfb9ea8df8f03e1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Baird","original_name":"John Baird","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ee24ced81b03c2259198f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0445957","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
