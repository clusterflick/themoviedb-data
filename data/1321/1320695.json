They have two natural children who are now grown, and a constantly changing number of adopted children. Parents leave their children to Tatyana and Artem's family for temporary upbringing. They are trusted by guardianship authorities, parents who cannot cope with themselves and the responsibilities of raising children, neighbors and older students. But they are not trusted by people who accidentally meet them at the crossroads of fate or social networks. The story is not only about the family of Tatiana and Artem, but also about the distrust of each of us in the kindness and mercy of others.","popularity":0.1144,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Скворечник","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Skvorechnik","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4846813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Zinovieva","original_name":"Ekaterina Zinovieva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a0aadcc81e9f0da76ea56d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4846813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Zinovieva","original_name":"Ekaterina Zinovieva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a0aaede16b483880021570","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4849915,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Artem Strunkin","original_name":"Artem Strunkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a2d8403f5aa03b445d38a5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4849916,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandra Koloditskaya","original_name":"Александра Колодицкая","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a2d85a896d52d59505fafd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
