Wolves, trees, stones, people. Through Gracile's quest to find her father, this documentary tale takes us into a world of men. Men whose sometimes tragic destinies are linked to the land they inhabit, whether by choice or necessity. It's as if a fatality drags them into the movement of the world in spite of themselves.  Like the men she meets along the way - all possible fathers for Gracile - the paths she travels sometimes open onto gaping wounds: devastated forests, mine holes, ruined industrial zones. The lament of trees can be heard while men remain silent.  From the moment she sets out and throughout her journey, the little girl is accompanied in spirit by her mother and nature, as well as by an Innu grandmother whose voice nourishes her dreams. This dreamlike world rubs shoulders with the raw reality Gracile is confronted with.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/55hv6wF08L15lkT77wZWQpPGUhU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tricycle","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le père de Gracile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Érika Desbiens","original_name":"Érika Desbiens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gracile","credit_id":"67ad70f421bcf1821e9f3e6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Réhel","original_name":"Marcel Réhel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Le père","credit_id":"67ad70fa3ee708327c3703ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gitane Tremblay","original_name":"Gitane Tremblay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"La mère","credit_id":"67ad70fe811fc2db87d0b984","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Normand Ouellet","original_name":"Normand Ouellet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Le travailleur forestier","credit_id":"67ad71043ee708327c3703d5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernand Fontaine","original_name":"Fernand Fontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"L'Innu dans la forêt","credit_id":"67ad710a21bcf1821e9f3e7a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grégoire McKenzie","original_name":"Grégoire McKenzie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Le bon grand-père","credit_id":"67ad710f21bcf1821e9f3e85","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie André","original_name":"Anne-Marie André","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"La conteuse Innu","credit_id":"67ad7115d63e9deeea36e59f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Lambert","original_name":"Lucie Lambert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qHbkjtsuo9hAkduPLozq6khVIN6.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7d5f286bde3a090a6d24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099075,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Lussier","original_name":"René Lussier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7d73a4bf1c1928bee76c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7d84a4bf1c1928bee777","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Roberge","original_name":"René Roberge","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7d9355dd812fad468a9f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Lambert","original_name":"Lucie Lambert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qHbkjtsuo9hAkduPLozq6khVIN6.jpg","credit_id":"67bb7da084e930a0210a9697","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Beaugrand","original_name":"Claude Beaugrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb7db606b5536bdc0aba3a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55hv6wF08L15lkT77wZWQpPGUhU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
