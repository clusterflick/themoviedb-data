She said she was a fan of my work and we started corresponding. These text messages turned into nightly Zoom calls which turned into a desire to meet in person. But travel restrictions in Germany and the US limited our choice to a handful of countries, one of which was England. She had a friend in London with an apartment that was going to be empty at the same time that my ex-wife was taking our kids to Maine for two weeks. So we decided to meet there. She wanted us to make a film together so I suggested we make a film about our relationship.\" - Caveh Zahedi","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trees Were Spelling Love Backwards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caveh Zahedi","original_name":"Caveh Zahedi","popularity":0.2074,"profile_path":"/lT0XuaVmnAIx9JY30giirlKOTBn.jpg","credit_id":"669ea9f6ddb6fd76bdf377e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
