We first see each of them in their own element: Zari painting to finish a piece for a gallery opening, and Aina coding her own video game designed to increase self-awareness. When Aina makes an effort to connect and Zari shuts her out again, Aina is triggered to send her girlfriend into the video game. In the game, Zari meets different versions of herself and her ego's desires. Ultimately, she has to decide what she's willing to let go of in order to advance to the next level. When the game malfunctions, Aina launches her back into reality and they finally confront each other.","popularity":0.3183,"poster_path":"/qM383hqrsjllN26pI7eyhGZfxCf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liminality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1972881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celeste O'Connor","original_name":"Celeste O'Connor","popularity":0.8564,"profile_path":"/jI3pNOhj9Gr7ym9cUcv8vsI0lCF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bubbi; Co-Zee","credit_id":"669fbca21819b19f3647ce2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia R.
