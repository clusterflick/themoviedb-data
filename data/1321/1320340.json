Tahsin Mansour lives across the Palestinian village of Azzoun. Once its mayor, he hasn't entered the village for years, fearing for his life. When the war broke out, a roadblock was installed, turning his house into an enclave - neither Palestinian nor Israeli. Tahsin reminisces on his days as a former leader of the Village Leagues: As Palestinian nationalism unites around the PLO in the 70s, the Israeli defense ministry offers incentives to a moderate leadership which will lay the ground for a diplomatic pact. The project draws fire from the Arab world and Israeli entities, declaring the Leagues members traitors. When this project fails, they become persecuted in their own homes.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/edwOcBUMf9sVr1JVaFa1368LdX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maagalot Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":116016,"logo_path":"/yrrmF7zlFFJAiCGOTdp8LDv8ZRH.png","name":"Kan","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":144051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makor Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":200998,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village Leagues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Ofek","original_name":"David Ofek","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc31082eafb954428a8b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234103,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aliza Esquira","original_name":"Aliza Esquira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc3741819b19f3647ce5a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Ofek","original_name":"David Ofek","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc318df0005effd98fb63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2818440,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sagit Shalom","original_name":"Sagit Shalom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc33cb03e642d8f6cd581","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tomer Asayag","original_name":"Tomer Asayag","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc35d127c5ca25d6cd595","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3128926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tal Michael","original_name":"Tal Michael","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc306c5e20d62a8189e8c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246340,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rotem Dror","original_name":"Rotem Dror","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc37f9a9cb2fa918f1d77","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3128926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tal Michael","original_name":"Tal Michael","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc3474d33079625cdd221","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3128926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tal Michael","original_name":"Tal Michael","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc2f9c81e9f0da76e7d91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2818442,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronnie Manor","original_name":"Ronnie Manor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc3339e75fdd0c9261373","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2224717,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dror Lebendiger","original_name":"Dror Lebendiger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fc36954278164e88f22b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33009222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z0RjGOK0ZOFSMpX2TJEWCx6Na04.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edwOcBUMf9sVr1JVaFa1368LdX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jerusalem Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
