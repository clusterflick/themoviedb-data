And for 38 years, 24 hours a day, craftsmen, artisans and woodworkers were kept busy building (and rebuilding) the most mysterious mansion ever created. Just why did one of the wealthiest women in the United States spend so much time and over five and a half million dollars on her home? Watch this amazing video! You'll be intrigued by the incredible details of Sarah's architectural fantasy, and learn the secrets of this \"beautiful but bizarre\" 160 room Victorian Mansion. Not only will you see the exquisite master craftsmanship and the beautiful original Tiffany art glass windows, but also the stairways vanishing in mid-flight, doors that swing open to expose... nothing and stair steps each a mere two inches tall!","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/wfj5EIhWx1XbIRDy6IUlND0Tw8b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"See areas of the mansion not shown on any tour.","title":"Winchester Mystery House Explored: Secrets of the Mansion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Fulton","original_name":"Andrea Fulton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (Self)","credit_id":"669f1b0963a2c896cd593527","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tam Fraser","original_name":"Tam Fraser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669f1b308e958f2a33e550ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844619,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Sarto","original_name":"Catherine Sarto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669f1b492e727c225c0c41ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3310484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wfj5EIhWx1XbIRDy6IUlND0Tw8b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Winchester Mystery House Explored: Secrets of the Mansion DVD","key":"KbIWF2nJoHQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-06T06:05:49.000Z","id":"669f1bf9a81856a32a103aef"}]}}}
