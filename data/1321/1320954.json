She is the first fiction filmmaker in the history of cinema. It was she who suggested to Léon Gaumont that he abandon simple animated views to shoot small scripted stories. Authorization is given to her to direct, and this is an exceptional fact in a profession reserved for men. Until 1907, she will reign over Gaumont’s production as director, artistic director, screenwriter, experimenting with faking and special effects.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/3qBS44Lbds7FprAyAvHFcWCJG9P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice Guy - 13 Courts-métrages","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","credit_id":"66a1550249bc9e7daa18b771","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/52N5I5Jm7fFAmFBZqtKLyym8b2l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2268,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qBS44Lbds7FprAyAvHFcWCJG9P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
