Annette assembles volunteers as they arrive downtown before sunrise, looking for birds that have flown into skyscrapers, before heading to their day jobs. The birds that survive are sent away for a stay at the Willowbrook Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. Broken Flight introduces us to the volunteers, scientists and veterinarians who rescue, study and catalog these amazing avian species.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Prince","original_name":"Annette Prince","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669efc97d06402da05503e57","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844498,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Otepka","original_name":"Chris Otepka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efcde1749839bf88f0d45","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844499,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Tisdale","original_name":"Adam Tisdale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efce94877b44c9bc8474f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560267,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mitchell Wenkus","original_name":"Mitchell Wenkus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efcc18ad439449a6e63f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erika Valenciana","original_name":"Erika Valenciana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efcb8fa06e1907e6e671e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264275,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rosángela Hernández Gómez","original_name":"Rosángela Hernández Gómez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efd0161d93289c7187f43","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560267,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mitchell Wenkus","original_name":"Mitchell Wenkus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efcca5243da88a7503873","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Hernández","original_name":"Magdalena Hernández","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669efcd350e7697d43611fbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33485478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BlackStar Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
