Our team created a graphic chimera through the transcription of analog signals from VCD, the subtitles and visual style of Hong Kong TV series in the 1990s, and the splicing of various media materials. It doesn’t matter that no material was recorded at that time. The key is that this chimera can become a real memory and history.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winder Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"凍天","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"horodiste vgroup","original_name":"horodiste vgroup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a003707a2704b38eddafcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
