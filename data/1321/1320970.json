There, the river separates two worlds that do not meet. In one of them, a vital treasure for the survival of the town is hidden, where a school houses a group of girls who share their hopes and despairs. In the other, hostility and uncertainty prevail. The river not only divides geographies, but also destinies. That is why crossing it is a challenge with unpredictable consequences.  “El Huaro” is there to remind them of the price of their decisions.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/nDSkpTbtBWmUJVulIcPzUemSVhU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buenaletra Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2024-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El huaro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Tiwi Pape","original_name":"Alberto Tiwi Pape","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66a15f0f43e27bdf4214b588","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabai Nela Tsejem Paati","original_name":"Mabai Nela Tsejem Paati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66a15f1724f39697ed72b7dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Segundo Bakuants Cuñachi","original_name":"Segundo Bakuants Cuñachi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66a15f1cf1439d9851a0a9a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Elvira Kasen Shawit","original_name":"Rosa Elvira Kasen Shawit","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66a15f224194f9b3d7dd7a43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suwa Rocío Daniel Danducho","original_name":"Suwa Rocío Daniel Danducho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66a15f28073923ad4918c140","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greysi Vílchez Pupujat","original_name":"Greysi Vílchez Pupujat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66a15f3124f39697ed72b7e7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Velapatiño Neyra","original_name":"Jenny Velapatiño Neyra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a15f06fadd7c4c9c3823ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricia Wiesse Risso","original_name":"Patricia Wiesse Risso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a15ef6a6059d7257cdfd79","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricia Wiesse Risso","original_name":"Patricia Wiesse Risso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a15ef0c4e63bdb74e0d994","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872153,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Juan Pablo Reyes Acevedo","original_name":"Juan Pablo Reyes Acevedo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678e8cd6dbcff33a9c65602b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jorge Gonzáles","original_name":"Jorge Gonzáles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678e8d0223459b4bd86dbad5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1672888,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antolín Prieto","original_name":"Antolín Prieto","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678e8d1468e0d873636e36a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34621733","wikidata_id":"Q129730167","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Rk2MKs0imhi38cl805S93uvcGR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/nDSkpTbtBWmUJVulIcPzUemSVhU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/fNvDzHbIH6XERX6D5rq9GVaLK6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lima Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"28 FCL PUCP | Tráiler El Huaro | Competencia Peruana","key":"YMxhs8zODYg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-09T01:39:49.000Z","id":"66a15f40359d1bde635db000"}]}}}
