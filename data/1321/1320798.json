She jumps to the worst case conclusion that her mother might never come home and prepares to take on the responsibilities left behind. As her catastrophizing escalates, she begins to consider her mother’s affect on her, and with the help of a semi-conscious stress ball, explores her fears in a world without her mother, but also the possibility that she may finally be free from a codependent relationship.","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":"/oivLymp6IetIpbKfXckFy0r607o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Don’t Read Enough","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3574785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Michalowska","original_name":"Emilia Michalowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kasia","credit_id":"66a107e832d4e61e6f0beaee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marzena Michalowska","original_name":"Marzena Michalowska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mother (voice)","credit_id":"66a1089849fec7422680cafd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noa Kozulin","original_name":"Noa Kozulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66a108a8c5e20d62a818c7b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847222,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aidan Parker","original_name":"Aidan Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66a108b3a9f8fa593f529e6b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Lyford","original_name":"Liam Lyford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66a108bd682acf36aa381b9f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847222,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aidan Parker","original_name":"Aidan Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1061613118c45660217e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noa Kozulin","original_name":"Noa Kozulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a105a23631af76bb09db93","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3574785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Michalowska","original_name":"Emilia Michalowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1060532b7dbb86735f936","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noa Kozulin","original_name":"Noa Kozulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a10593a67ab9c6bd381bcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3574785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Michalowska","original_name":"Emilia Michalowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a10631b27abfd91335f8f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847236,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Borja","original_name":"David Borja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a107bb0a3f9bc561dd7c90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847223,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Faith Abi Haydar","original_name":"Faith Abi Haydar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1066676eb26a1ca381d57","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Katherine Gordon","original_name":"Katherine Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a10751fc113f04da2632e9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noa Kozulin","original_name":"Noa Kozulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a10622f15568a11b0217f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3904743,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Krystal Chan","original_name":"Krystal Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a1064b6fe68f521472b3f6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33007948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oivLymp6IetIpbKfXckFy0r607o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
