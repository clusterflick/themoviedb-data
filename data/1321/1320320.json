There, tormented memories from childhood resurface, all intricately connected to an ancient, mystifying force lurking beneath the lake's depths, driving Tom inexorably towards madness. As Tom's communication dwindles into eerie silence, Kathy enlists the help of her brother Mark and sister-in-law Jess, a trauma and grief counsellor. Unaware of the sinister malevolence seeping from the lake, Tom becomes a willing vessel for the same evil that claimed his parents and now threatens all who dare draw near.","popularity":0.2232,"poster_path":"/qmFs75uvjBCrn0Gc3SVRMMtij0p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Daemon","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The DÃ¦mon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145743,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tyler Q.
