The Truth About Fussy Eaters explores the cutting edge of eating disorder research with the help of expert therapists and psychologists, to shed light on a newly identified, potentially deadly and widely misunderstood condition which affects millions of people worldwide. Whilst disorders such as Bulimia and Anorexia relate to body image, sufferers of Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder instead display a deep psychological aversion to certain foods, and are often left terrifyingly malnourished, unable to function, and on the precipice of a dangerous medical crisis.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Truth About Fussy Eaters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
