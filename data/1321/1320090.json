It meets with his satisfaction and he purchases it. He begins to carry the thing home, and meets with quite a little trouble; but his will makes the way and he reaches his room safely. Anxious to begin his investigations, he sheds his coat quickly, rolls up his sleeves, and taking his huge carving knife in hand begins to cut the mummy up. His old landlady passes by and sees her boarder at his peculiar work; he is so engrossed in his task that he does not see her, and she, catching a glimpse of a human form, runs out in alarm. With the cry that a man is being cut up in her house, she summons the butcher, the baker, the grocer and a score of women, who follow in wonder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La momie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Mummy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1833724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1908-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
