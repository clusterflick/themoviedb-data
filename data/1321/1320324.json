His girlfriend, Brie, wishes he wasn't so mean-spirited about debunking spirits, but Charlie's humorous, sarcastic style is what his burgeoning audience loves. All this changes when Charlie meets Duncan, a junior professor at Pasadena-Tech University. Duncan claims he can scientifically prove there's no afterlife. When his experiment goes awry, Charlie’s life and career are turned upside down.","popularity":0.9926,"poster_path":"/nNJd5QRz8lGHGy5GKrCN1CDQOgN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Podcast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Foley","original_name":"Dave Foley","popularity":1.3038,"profile_path":"/muHRRGDTE7ZWk3guqDAk9L4DqVX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Milton P.
