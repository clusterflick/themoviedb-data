He only spoke Khmer and everything he saw was unfamiliar, but he was a cheerful child and to fit in, he put any traces of his short first life out of mind, though not entirely. His older sister, Maklin, is in Italy, too, and a few years later a letter arrives: Vakhimâ€™s birth mother is asking after him. Francesca and Simone, his adoptive parents, decide to go look for her.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":"/r722C2Xh8OTI9t8z8HRg8W4Dm1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vakhim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vakhim Borra","original_name":"Vakhim Borra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"669fa23c560a7e68d44c1130","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maklin Tosi","original_name":"Maklin Tosi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"669fa249d72f375cff52cf27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Borra","original_name":"Simone Borra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"669fa2542bada0e7a86e7ecd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Pirani","original_name":"Francesca Pirani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"669fa262fc113f04da260bd1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Pirani","original_name":"Francesca Pirani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fa2781819b19f3647cd90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4845195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Pirani","original_name":"Francesca Pirani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fa283e296d3a524189810","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r722C2Xh8OTI9t8z8HRg8W4Dm1H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
