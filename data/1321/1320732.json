The cycle of life (birth/death)—as well as the epigenetic scars inherited from ancestors’ fight-or-flight past—contribute to how we re-imagine/re-tell our narratives. Past poems (written) have now been deconstructed, re-arranged, and re-told as video poems. In the poem \"1996\", we hear the artist retell her journey to Lithuania as a 25-year-old graduate student—not a typical trip—as all \"coincidences\" in her journey seem to suggest she was being vetted as a mini diplomat or unofficial intelligence contact at the time. A trip to the borderland area of Kaliningrad, a conversation with the president, and some family secrets divulged resonate throughout the piece, causing the artist to ponder this suspicious series of events.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/at1hysfxO42ikzEmevc09P3HLY2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1996-1997 (Memories of Lietuva)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4846982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lina Ramona Vitkauskas","original_name":"Lina Ramona Vitkauskas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a0ca09958531da34bf6194","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/at1hysfxO42ikzEmevc09P3HLY2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
