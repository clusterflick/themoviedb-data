Islanders go about in their daily microcosms - in the kitchen, in the garden, in the workplace and in their \"hangouts\", when researchers invade asking for something rather personal. A clash of energies rises between locals and perplexed scientists that leaves no stone unturned, in the attempt to understand frozen time and intriguing idiosyncrasies. A comedic study in pacing and reframing a world view.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/tfQEEVA13RBCTK4HqnKxLoKpGYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":226230,"logo_path":"/o8dXLtHVOdrCr5VH3rdt3J1zOrJ.png","name":"Alaska Films","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Microbiome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stavros Petropoulos","original_name":"Stavros Petropoulos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6218d857a275020042746f8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandros Chantzis","original_name":"Αλέξανδρος Χαντζής","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e7e56aad9c2001b5155a6","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184660,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yannis Kanakis","original_name":"Γιάννης Κανάκης","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e7e1f2866fa00807f347f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657516,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stamos Dimitropoulos","original_name":"Στάμος Δημητρόπουλος","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e7e2d4e4dff00791c1685","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2682916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonidas Konstantarakos","original_name":"Λεωνίδας Κωνστανταράκος","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675605e0cf1801968f02d566","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1634,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfQEEVA13RBCTK4HqnKxLoKpGYE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1089}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'MICROBIOME' (2021) documentary trailer","key":"ToDJFlc_3vE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-01T15:48:09.000Z","id":"622e7db32a210c001b5c9933"}]}}}
