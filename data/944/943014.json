There is an elderly couple who live together. The husband still works, albeit sparingly, and the wife does the housework. They eat together, know each other's tastes, and talk a little while watching TV. The film is a quiet account of their unhurried life together.  The camera's gaze is quiet but gentle as it carefully follows the old couple, interspersed with summer scenes from the countryside, like a documentary. The camera's gaze is quiet but gentle, and the occasional embarrassing gestures and expressions on the couple's faces give the viewer a sense of closeness to the camera (and to the people holding it). The old man is a very picturesque subject even when he is just standing there, but this film has a peculiar rhythm to it, which may be staged or naturalistic.","popularity":0.054,"poster_path":"/19x8Cy9h37IpLHg52ndJBp66sEh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hosei University Cinema Original Members","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"友達に逢う列車","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takei Toru","original_name":"Takei Toru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62178c7dce5d82001b3e67ee","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takei Toru","original_name":"Takei Toru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62178c23d144430043f4a567","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takei Toru","original_name":"Takei Toru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62178c6b54f6eb001b76d5ff","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takei Toru","original_name":"Takei Toru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62178c717fcab3001c0fce57","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takei Toru","original_name":"Takei Toru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62178c77d14443001bee2c66","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/19x8Cy9h37IpLHg52ndJBp66sEh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
