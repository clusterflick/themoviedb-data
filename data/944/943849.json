Since 2018 Tosatti has concentrated all his practice on a project entitled \"My Heart is a Void, the Void is a Mirror\", an episodic visual novel, developed around the world with the aim of witnessing the state of crisis of democracy in the West. The Odessa Episode - which follows the stages of Catania, Riga and Cape Town - is the installation developed by the artist after a long period spent in Ukraine, in the most dramatic moment of the Covid-19 emergency, when the country was closed to foreigners. The film recounts the efforts made to carry out a powerfully visionary work in those difficult months.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/eRTL5WEuzDdmeFbwcfUpr3jWNbx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Heart is a Void, the Void is a Mirror - Odessa Episode","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gian Maria Tosatti","original_name":"Gian Maria Tosatti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621a3ce179a1c3001b68c148","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoliy Kasyanov","original_name":"Anatoliy Kasyanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621a3d0f7b7b4d006c874685","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Verbytskyi","original_name":"Sergey Verbytskyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621a3d2e89d97f001bb32fde","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Mazur","original_name":"Alexey Mazur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621a3d387b7b4d001bd37b71","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Voloshchuk","original_name":"Andrey Voloshchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621a3d5089d97f006957eddc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavlo Linnik","original_name":"Pavlo Linnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621a3d62383df2001d896ee3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Quagliozzi","original_name":"Lorenzo Quagliozzi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a3c2989d97f001bb32d2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Quagliozzi","original_name":"Lorenzo Quagliozzi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a3c98489d00004379de2d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gian Maria Tosatti","original_name":"Gian Maria Tosatti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a3ca889d97f006957eb7b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14531280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/eRTL5WEuzDdmeFbwcfUpr3jWNbx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
