Tired of Birnie using his body as a bed and breakfast, Arnie tries to put an end to Birnie, over and over again. Windlight uses motion capture to block out the overall movement, then animates on top of that data to achieve the more cartoony effects and motion expected of character animation. The result is a hybrid of cartoon gags and subtle human movements.","popularity":0.3559,"poster_path":"/n9eDwzuuAkly2lpc8iyvBdsv8Pe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Windlight
