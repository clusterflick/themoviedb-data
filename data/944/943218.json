Upon his return, Brett met Alexandria, an inner-city educator recovering from a devastating loss, and Matthew, a tech-savvy social impact advocate. The three bonded over a belief that the shelter crisis needed new solutions, and despite their qualifications, they set out to change the narrative for thousands of families in need. From funding their first home to constructing the world’s first 3D printed community, No Small Dreams chronicles how three underdogs built New Story – a housing nonprofit focused on solving homelessness through innovation, dignity, and transparency.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Small Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Hagler","original_name":"Brett Hagler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"621805ea3d4d96001a308ca6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandria Lafci","original_name":"Alexandria Lafci","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621805f8a275020042720f46","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Marshall","original_name":"Matthew Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6218061179a1c3001b62a497","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie Brannon","original_name":"Annie Brannon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621805ce7fcab3001c113f63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Bach","original_name":"Nathan Bach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621805a1383df2001d825008","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Bach","original_name":"Nathan Bach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621805ba3d4d9600410590b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18232162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
