Collaborating with William Johnston, a photographer and scholar of Japanese history, Otake’s multidisciplinary project transforms the irradiated landscape into a site for performance. The artist’s movements—in empty train stations, overgrown roads, tsunami-damaged buildings, along broken seawalls, and amidst makeshift memorials—dwell in the residue of life before the meltdown while also charting the passage of time in these inhabitable lands. A Body in Fukushima is culled from tens of thousands of photographs, whose mournful but resolute march creates a “letter to the future.” “My body will carry a piece of Fukushima,” writes the artist, “I hope the [viewer’s] sense of their own distance to Fukushima might also change.”","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/84D3WFfwDU01I6hn4dg7aw0rajj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Body in Fukushima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"621ae9872a210c00438e34ca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ae8016840cc0071720cd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445348,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William Johnston","original_name":"William Johnston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ae86319ab5900429bb2e1","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ae86e09dda40042abbd59","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Harrington","original_name":"David Harrington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ae8c2eb0932001ba1c084","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ae90e2a210c00438e326a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b136f84591c00692e9500","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84D3WFfwDU01I6hn4dg7aw0rajj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
