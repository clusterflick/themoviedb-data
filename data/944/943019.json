Decades drive these people away. The physical proximity is separated by a fence and the set of prejudices, inexplicable hatred and lack of generosity.\r In the end of the year, between Christmas and New Year, the families gather on their respective farms. What nobody knows is that a love between two young people is about to break this barrier that is much bigger than the fence that divides the fields. The passion between Rodrigo and Juliana could be the point of recovery for a relationship marked by so many years of hatred, but, like Shakespeare's original story, the human being is much more complex and inexplicable. Whether in Verona, Italy, or on a border farm. Tragedy lives inside people and is sometimes impossible to control.","popularity":0.195,"poster_path":"/qQhcMJG0PbSR9xOXyMaA8RCo6Pk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17680,"logo_path":"/7RtrfAVWgne5MRgXl8O3oD6Ncom.png","name":"Accorde
