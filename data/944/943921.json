Youngsters with a hidden past and an insecure future, who suddenly turn up in our daily lives and disappear again virtually unnoticed, while we have hardly any idea what their 'state of being' is. The documentary was inspired by a project executed at schools, in which these adolescents made a small wooden box that was painted and plastered, sometimes with photographs or small objects, containing their dearest memories phrased in a personal poem in Dutch. Because the film takes the poems as its starting point, it offers spectators a direct peek into the youngsters' 'inner world'.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64071,"logo_path":null,"name":"NGN produkties","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2007-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mijn kamer is mijn beste vriend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1930413,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"René van der Eijk","original_name":"René van der Eijk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a87d0afa1b0006cc98a43","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Berenike Rozgonyi","original_name":"Berenike Rozgonyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a8789f1b5710042ccbb53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206803,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harold Jalving","original_name":"Harold Jalving","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a87d82811a100434fdf1b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445105,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"O.Ph.
