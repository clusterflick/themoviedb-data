It's the end of November and Ayumi, a fourth-year university student hasn't received a job offer. She meets her childhood friend, Chiharu, at a company interview as the last chance. She tells her that their mutual friend Iwata is in a mental hospital. Ayumi is disappointed to hear that her boyfriend Takuya, who lives with her, is working at the end of the year and beginning of the new year, but she receives the results of the exam. Meanwhile, Chiharu gives Iwata a sketchbook that she was given before she was hospitalised, with a gift in return.  It's not all good, but it's not all bad either. The film is a series of episodes that subtly capture the reality of life. The film digests a timely topic without losing its newsworthiness and makes it a film that everyone can relate to.","popularity":0.1324,"poster_path":"/1i3bVNEzF3sW93ywKUAPYPwRLZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"生活","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arai Yuko","original_name":"Arai Yuko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"621921b6ce5d82001b435d13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masuda Shogo","original_name":"Masuda Shogo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"621921c3dd926a006912f6ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ando Satoko","original_name":"Ando Satoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621921c9383df2006c16c940","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sugiura Yasuhiro","original_name":"Sugiura Yasuhiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621921ceafa1b0006cc58464","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nagai Miyuki","original_name":"Nagai Miyuki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621921d68d2f8d001bfc5d25","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443426,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kuma Keiichiro","original_name":"Kuma Keiichiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621921fba88587006cd57c1a","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2325435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Atsuya Asano","original_name":"浅野敦也","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621922060e597b001b9f74a7","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dai Asaki","original_name":"浅木大","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62192210befb0900425ce757","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akiyoshi Sugiura","original_name":"Akiyoshi Sugiura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624727a1a0be2800664f95c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akiyoshi Sugiura","original_name":"Akiyoshi Sugiura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624727a88ee49c006481e4f9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akiyoshi Sugiura","original_name":"Akiyoshi Sugiura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624727b1a3e4ba009f729ec7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1i3bVNEzF3sW93ywKUAPYPwRLZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
