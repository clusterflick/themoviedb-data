It was one day during spring break, when everyone got together and started playing cards as usual. But for some reason, Takizawa was the only one who kept losing. As a punishment, he is made to drink whisky in one gulp, but as soon as he puts on a toy monkey mask, he turns into a real monkey. Kinoshita, who is now living with the monkey Takizawa, tries somehow to turn him back into a human, but without success. When the new school year begins with Takizawa still a monkey, Kinoshita becomes impatient and decides to make a last-ditch effort...  What is human identity? is blended into the everyday scenery and cartoony setting without any sense of discomfort. The audience will find themselves moved by the seemingly ridiculous laughter.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/tFfNnYTAMIkkGnouMZylr31VSLB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"君はサルじゃない","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tabuchi Tsutomu","original_name":"Tabuchi Tsutomu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6217851c3a9937001a1fc352","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","original_name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6217852288bbe600427616c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takizawa Ryo","original_name":"Takizawa Ryo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6217852979a1c3001b6109ff","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441870,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takahiko Chikushiro","original_name":"Takahiko Chikushiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621785508d2f8d006a6b3c55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441870,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takahiko Chikushiro","original_name":"Takahiko Chikushiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217855988bbe6004276171b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","original_name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62178508a88587001bebbe5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","original_name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217850188bbe6006be80c30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","original_name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621785420e597b001b9a8f5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441868,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Maki Hotta","original_name":"Maki Hotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217853354f6eb001b76c55f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","original_name":"Tatsuya Kinoshita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217850c54f6eb006951908d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441869,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hiroyuki Nakanishi","original_name":"Hiroyuki Nakanishi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217853b7fcab3001c0fc06e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tFfNnYTAMIkkGnouMZylr31VSLB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
