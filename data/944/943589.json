A woman who lives with a sense of loneliness, where no one pays attention to her. A woman lives with such loneliness. One day, she meets a man who can control balloons, and is fascinated by him. They find a castle on the outskirts of town and start to live together. It is a dream come true that seems to last forever for the woman. But it is the man who puts an end to them.  But there is a perfect partner who does not need words or time to understand and to whom she can entrust eternity. This is the hope of the protagonist, who seems to be too innocent, entrusted with the mathematical symbol \"∞\", which represents a series of beads and strings. Can the balloon man become half of ∞?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dkLVRJmnkqW4QcRZrtNyi0a2R1S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170601,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemount Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"レムニスケート","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoya Koda","original_name":"Tomoya Koda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62193201a88587006cd5b203","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitoko Konnani","original_name":"Hitoko Konnani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6219320d7b7b4d004276137e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiko Yamaguchi","original_name":"Nobuhiko Yamaguchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621931e6cee2f6004242fdd3","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirofumi Okamura","original_name":"Hirofumi Okamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621931b6cee2f6006b948487","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443564,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sawako Teraoka","original_name":"Sawako Teraoka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621931ef90cf51006138195f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Yagi","original_name":"Kazuhiro Yagi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621931d5a27502004275f2b2","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkLVRJmnkqW4QcRZrtNyi0a2R1S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
