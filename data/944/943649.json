Unable to deal with his condition she looks at him and turns away, but a series of incidents forces her to spend the day in the building. First a mishap which makes her change her clothes, then an old woman stuck with her wheelchair in the hallway and then the head nurse that thinks Hagar is a Russian caretaker. She gets swallowed up in the work and slowly becomes part of the staff. The short visit turns into a journey between the narrow corridors of society.","popularity":0.2046,"poster_path":"/7Nk59EnptyZo7AoSAvottjhjpPQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2014-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Official Selection at Cannes' Cinéfondation (2014)","title":"The Visit","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"HaBikur","type":"Hebrew"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2941381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Berman","original_name":"Natalie Berman","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hagar","credit_id":"6219634990cf510018a6b526","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yosef Carmon","original_name":"Yosef Carmon","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hagar's Father","credit_id":"6219635919ab59001c703133","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morad Hassan","original_name":"Morad Hassan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6219637319ab59001c703178","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maya Zaydman","original_name":"Maya Zaydman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62196415afa1b0006cc61648","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799888,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Jaffe","original_name":"Jeremy Jaffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62196402cee2f6006b9554db","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2415744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inbar Horesh","original_name":"Inbar Horesh","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621963c0a27502006d772516","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yotam Ben-David","original_name":"Yotam Ben-David","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621963f6489d000069102667","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443846,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avi Siman-Tov","original_name":"Avi Siman-Tov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621964250e597b001ba08ec9","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799885,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Omer Lotan","original_name":"Omer Lotan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621963e5489d00004376dc77","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maya Zaydman","original_name":"Maya Zaydman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621963d9ce5d82006928c864","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2415744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inbar Horesh","original_name":"Inbar Horesh","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621963cba8858700421b420c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3672874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mzeXHkQfadXHRoVaxnAjdamLZrP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1408}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1505,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Nk59EnptyZo7AoSAvottjhjpPQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1004}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":292945,"name":"cinéfondation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Visit Trailer  |  הביקור טריילר","key":"93459730","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-05-01T06:59:12.000Z","id":"621961f48d2f8d0042a41bce"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE VISIT","key":"92173158","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-04-16T19:13:01.000Z","id":"621961d1afa1b0006cc61162"}]}}}
