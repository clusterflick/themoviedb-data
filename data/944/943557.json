What will disappear next?  The protagonist feels less and less alive every day. Even though she is a virgin, the only way she can think of to confirm her own life is to try a pregnancy test. To put an end to her boredom and pessimism, she leaves a message on her dial Q2 and meets a man. What does she get in exchange for making a man with a voice fetish cum?  Despite the stylish pictures with a French taste, the story deepens from ennui to horror. The first half of the film, \"the sense of alienation peculiar to a period when one is not young enough to be called a girl, but young enough to be called a woman\", becomes \"a scary story in the style of modern folklore\" at the end.","popularity":0.2617,"poster_path":"/jw1aSwRakQCjFlDIwB4iIFCRIHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"それでも夜明けは訪れて","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshihiro Fukagawa","original_name":"深川栄洋","popularity":0.3256,"profile_path":"/xpGTSUsdYHPBTnCZ03HNOq3b4dY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621922e3ce5d82001b436344","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuko Sueda","original_name":"Yuko Sueda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621922ed7b7b4d004275da7e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892047,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chihiro Inoue","original_name":"Chihiro Inoue","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621922d592e55b006c269815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892047,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chihiro Inoue","original_name":"Chihiro Inoue","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621922da54f6eb00439303a7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryôji Okamoto","original_name":"Ryôji Okamoto","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62192dd0d14443001bf2db64","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443491,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chatani Jun","original_name":"Chatani Jun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62192de2befb090068ddf8d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443495,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Makioka Hirohiko","original_name":"Makioka Hirohiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62192e10ce5d82001b439915","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jw1aSwRakQCjFlDIwB4iIFCRIHv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
