When she opens the door, she finds a zombie, Little Red Riding Hood.  Once upon a time...\" The title of the picture book is \"Red Riding Hood\". But it's about two old women, a wizard and a fortune-teller, who are fighting each other. The fortune-teller's granddaughter, Little Red Riding Hood, dies of the plague as soon as she comes out - and she's not the only one. But that's where her success comes in. Dug up in the middle of her decay by a wizard, Little Red Riding Hood is resurrected as a zombie with the brains of a goat. Her only order is to kill her grandmother, but when she learns the smell of blood and the pleasure of killing, there's no stopping her.  This is an immoral fairy tale for adults, animated with exquisite models. The puppets, with their European gloom, match the content of the story too well.","popularity":0.0735,"poster_path":"/qg2xGMsBM0K9iyoZS5Z0PS5E2qs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"～Little Red Riding Hood～Little Red Riding Hood～","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takuya Miyano","original_name":"Takuya Miyano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62191fdc7b7b4d004275d04d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaki Naito","original_name":"Masaki Naito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62191ff8ce5d82001b4354e2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443414,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yuji Yasui","original_name":"Yuji Yasui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62191fd390cf510041560b8a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443416,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ito Mirei","original_name":"Ito Mirei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62191ff0a88587006cd57740","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaki Naito","original_name":"Masaki Naito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62191fe68d2f8d001bfc562c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaki Naito","original_name":"Masaki Naito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62191fbd79a1c3001b653ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qg2xGMsBM0K9iyoZS5Z0PS5E2qs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
