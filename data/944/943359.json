After spotting an encroaching rain cloud, the wallaby is lured by distant laughter, only to come across a mass grave of dead animals and its one sole survivor - a delirious kookaburra. After an unhelpful transaction, the kookaburra suddenly reveals itself to be a terrible monster of pure flame. The wallaby, fearful for its life, escapes through the underbrush and into the open on the edge of a cliff, where the fire can no longer grow fuel. Seemingly safe the wallaby finds new hope in the returning rain cloud. But the wallaby soon learns that the cloud was smoke all along.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
