The film takes its title from the first shot, a single take set to Fauré's setting of \"Au bord de l'eau\" by René-François Sully-Prudhomme. The image shows a tree in bloom near a stream, during an extraordinarily long warm streak in February, a dream of spring in the middle of winter outside Chicago. A false spring that doomed the exuberant tree's fruit.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sWaTJGZqQuToCoaKtcJYvIYFpEl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prelude (Foreplay/Mourning)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1774574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konrad Steiner","original_name":"Konrad Steiner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621884507b7b4d001bced0bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":923,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sWaTJGZqQuToCoaKtcJYvIYFpEl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":615}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
