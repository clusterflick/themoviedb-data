The owner, a local influential politician, has avoided paying for the maintenance of the building under the legal standards by using his connections to proclaim the building a national cultural heritage. However, the rent he has been charging was as if the building were an object that offered standard comfort. The only German tenant takes the crew around and speaks of his battle against the landlord’s manipulation.","popularity":0.9422,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":170647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alligator Film (Munich)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Protection of the State","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","credit_id":"621a223cf1b571006dc7899d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","credit_id":"621a2233d14443001bf65aea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrej Popović","original_name":"Andrej Popović","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621a2251a88587006cd85577","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":2437,"name":"munich, germany"},{"id":6095,"name":"house"},{"id":11479,"name":"social commentary"},{"id":11318,"name":"landlord"},{"id":11320,"name":"tenant"},{"id":166888,"name":"bad landlord"},{"id":182422,"name":"landlord tenant relationship"},{"id":209889,"name":"west germany"},{"id":233236,"name":"monuments"},{"id":267208,"name":"cultural preservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
