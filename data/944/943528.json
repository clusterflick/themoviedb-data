Outside shots show a pattern of coloured square blocks. On the inside, long curved galleries run around a large inner court. The residents that Petterson films - sometimes outside, but mostly at home - are all waiting. The American painter Mark is waiting until he can return to Australia 'and forget this ever happened'. The young rapper Robel waits for his own house, also in the Peperklip, where he currently still lives with his mother - but first he needs an adequate income.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het leven is ergens anders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Petterson","original_name":"Jennifer Petterson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621916ab0e597b001b9f4759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6153086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
