When witnesses insist the culprit exhibited superhuman abilities, Constable Crabtree (Jonny Harris, Still Standing) realizes the robber bears a striking resemblance to the title character of his new graphic novel, Jumping Jack. As more robberies targeting gifts from Eaton's luxury department occur around Toronto, Murdoch and his team are forced to consider the possibility that Crabtree's character has come to life. As Station House No. 4 contends with the real-life Jumping Jack, Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig, Coronation Street) orders the formation of a police choir, and Dr. Julia Ogden (Hélène Joy, Durham County) tries to help two orphans who mistake her for a fairytale heroine. Can Murdoch and his team stop Jumping Jack from stealing Christmas?","popularity":1.5016,"poster_path":"/vKjjDepIQ5JGxznoAI45b4wNR9Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Murdoch Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yannick Bisson","original_name":"Yannick Bisson","popularity":0.5523,"profile_path":"/pUxydAXsxH7NwVuB2AFIjMrUxP7.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Detective William Murdoch","credit_id":"59f39e2092514122c101a15b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Joy","original_name":"Helene Joy","popularity":0.7545,"profile_path":"/23Qzyov88pRq8BRGTOcIVc7BeQa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Julia Ogden","credit_id":"59f39e96c3a368718801a4ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonny Harris","original_name":"Jonny Harris","popularity":0.3754,"profile_path":"/bpW9XBxarq85KUiQIjoV2efngip.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Constable George Crabtree","credit_id":"59f39ece925141222201a6b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lachlan Murdoch","original_name":"Lachlan Murdoch","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/uFHp92C3VdOc8MQ5m6khkFPmiD1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Constable Henry Higgins","credit_id":"59f39f03925141223b01aedb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1590228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mouna Traoré","original_name":"Mouna Traoré","popularity":0.4229,"profile_path":"/8X6oFWuLVNHQ5NbMPjrvglPWl8t.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rebecca James","credit_id":"59f39f32c3a3687217018983","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristian Bruun","original_name":"Kristian Bruun","popularity":0.6639,"profile_path":"/m2yXWJAQEWYPF5Q7DHqJtj3r9mc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Constable Jackson","credit_id":"59f39f68925141223001a4c7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arwen Humphreys","original_name":"Arwen Humphreys","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/q9ocfQMwfnwQfrFdJwXGaGpPCQ2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Margaret Brackenreid","credit_id":"59f3a00d92514122c101a338","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Moore","original_name":"Frank Moore","popularity":0.2826,"profile_path":"/aDonlIASBuom6Y6DPLqAxVFvtpq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lance Henderson","credit_id":"59f3a0c8925141222201a883","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel S.
