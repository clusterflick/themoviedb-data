Eva feels oppressed by her conventional parents. Vera and Lasse live with their daughter in a depressing suburb environment. Lena lives alone with her three-year-old son Pelle. Sven and Bibi live together in a small one-room apartment where they constantly quarrel. Sven sees the big family most as an opportunity for sexual experiments.  A young French medical student, Paul, meets Bibi through common acquaintances and moves into the collective. The reason is simply that he has been attracted to Bibi. Meanwhile, Sven is increasingly interested in Lena.","popularity":0.2894,"poster_path":"/8HmMz5o9DyTx37B4nzK2LqvBqHz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Swedish Film Production","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1974-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sams","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stig Törnblom","original_name":"Stig Törnblom","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/8XZ9Dq3ZAmOSUKMCU8kdahkdyi3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sven","credit_id":"59f194aac3a368064e02c39e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Carlwind","original_name":"Christina Carlwind","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/kWR2gGTXTnUB5lr5oDYsmXaWXvk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bibi","credit_id":"59f194bcc3a36806c4029b64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Jacques Lapeyronnie","original_name":"Jean Jacques Lapeyronnie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"59f194cfc3a368064e02c3c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent-Arne Dahlgren","original_name":"Kent-Arne Dahlgren","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lasse","credit_id":"59f194fd9251416aab02a4d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Tillberg","original_name":"Louise Tillberg","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vera","credit_id":"59f1950fc3a368064e02c404","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunilla Thunberg","original_name":"Gunilla Thunberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"59f1951f9251416aab02a4fe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":272929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Amble","original_name":"Lars Amble","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":"/6hpA5doJAM3wR2JaCs3ZkLmVDdL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sven's colleague","credit_id":"5e6365163e01ea0015e936fc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mats Bergström","original_name":"Mats Bergström","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Pelle","credit_id":"5e63652c459ad6001156bc1a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gunilla Bergström","original_name":"Gunilla Bergström","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/4vTclly2CqOgCQT3sCfpmmeOemD.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lena","credit_id":"5e63654c55c92600155cb42a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Gillborg","original_name":"Sara Gillborg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"5e636563357c0000193579fd","order":9},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":985054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie Berglund","original_name":"Anne-Marie Berglund","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"The odd woman","credit_id":"5e71b960cabfe40011191121","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yvonne Floyd","original_name":"Yvonne Floyd","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f19552c3a368066502aafe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31193,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Forsberg","original_name":"Tony Forsberg","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/oXEWC290BLtBwuhOtYOIeOvd05S.jpg","credit_id":"59f19565c3a3680ef1007e7f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calvin Floyd","original_name":"Calvin Floyd","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f19545c3a3680ef4008b7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0073653","wikidata_id":"Q14955400","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/8HmMz5o9DyTx37B4nzK2LqvBqHz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
