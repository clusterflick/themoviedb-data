Barely of age, but not exactly adults, they still know nothing of love. Anatole sleeps wherever he is able while waiting for a stable job to come along, whereas Tess is about to start preparatory classes in Paris. They first meet in the surroundings of a port in decline, like a symbol of a country that is suffocating but which still has something to say. He has a tent, she has a car: together they will criss-cross the country’s roads and draw out the summer, to ensure they never forget.","popularity":0.3111,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":819,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":34780,"logo_path":"/ahgzFRXKF2fkOV0WfB0RCxEmxki.png","name":"Chi-Fou-Mi Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Escapade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joséphine Japy","original_name":"Joséphine Japy","popularity":0.4857,"profile_path":"/Aw6TZ5WWX5IPu86mK45AyTlo0hd.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Tess","credit_id":"59f31adf925141223000f30d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nekfeu","original_name":"Nekfeu","popularity":0.3438,"profile_path":"/sVKMza7sJ5ObqgoiJB1Jdrjeq4e.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anatole","credit_id":"59f31aea925141223b00f94c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Paradot","original_name":"Rod Paradot","popularity":0.2122,"profile_path":"/6ks9zfw3IFcz6t2IAhokM90D5E1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guillaume","credit_id":"59f31b0a9251416aaf04ca47","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1312204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karidja Touré","original_name":"Karidja Touré","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/5YqrVYUzvy0suoSp6oQPD0YgbQs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Morgane","credit_id":"59f31b11c3a36870e700fa64","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Lavant","original_name":"Denis Lavant","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/WgGsHm3IC6ocjmjslREvKKNnX3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jacques","credit_id":"59f31b1a925141223b00f993","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891317,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vincent Mazel","original_name":"Vincent Mazel","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pRWjWtovIoqTVaJggdml379rSGR.jpg","credit_id":"59f31ba5c3a368712600f19b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mathias Pardo","original_name":"Mathias Pardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f31b66925141223b00fa09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Romain Mazel","original_name":"Romain Mazel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f31b81c3a368718800f31f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mathias Pardo","original_name":"Mathias Pardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f31b6f925141229f00fca7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugo Sélignac","original_name":"Hugo Sélignac","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/5Y3isgZG6coSktv2npPUAcbh9kE.jpg","credit_id":"59f31b94925141229f00fcfc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7087306","wikidata_id":"Q39074441","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
