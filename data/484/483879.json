But over-collecting for human consumption, pollution and predation by introduced species have devastated the Titicaca water frog — which has a hard enough life as is, given its resemblance to a certain human sexual organ and the many unflattering nicknames that has spawned. In 2016, 10,000 frogs died all at once, and it wasn’t the first mass die-off this critically endangered species has experienced. This short film from The Redford Center shines a new light on these underappreciated animals, showing their amazing adaptability, crucial role in the aquatic ecosystem and what’s at stake — unless humans intervene.","popularity":0.1279,"poster_path":"/9aDRI9Y5lwx1fO3pxVs5ofwaRYq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody Loves Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Garchar","original_name":"Ben Garchar","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/ZEkAM3GzdXQXpq3Wd9wUeETVCl.jpg","credit_id":"661f17b4a6fdaa01636aa0d8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Reichert","original_name":"Jeff Reichert","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f48cc49251414d5701285e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farihah Zaman","original_name":"Farihah Zaman","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f48cd89251414cfd012b1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7692496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9aDRI9Y5lwx1fO3pxVs5ofwaRYq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
