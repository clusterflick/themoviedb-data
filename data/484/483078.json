While creating shot-by-shot reproductions of each scene, including accompanying subtitled dialogue, Wiseman’s representational strategy–his overall production and editing process–is, itself, evoked as an institution subject to the same means of observation and expression.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Service of the Goods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Paul Kelly","original_name":"Jean-Paul Kelly","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ee7d3ac3a36851bd02f7f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12455858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWwOT6iEbmLSFXEP2vagV6uh8Mj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1t4xywtckIyFh65VtIJiKWk2IEX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"We Are One","release_date":"2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
