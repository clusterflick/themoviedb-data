They have lost the ability to distinguish public face and true self. In this way Akio (Japanese: Light) withdraws albeit with a specific goal. He wants to free himself from the pressures of the globalized society, from his own fears, and ultimately from the limitations of his own body as well as concepts like space and time.","popularity":0.0816,"poster_path":"/sj11DsSlw4Yb7dwG0WwgJ5bjt0c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Michael Müller","original_name":"Kai Michael Müller","popularity":0.2238,"profile_path":"/zzx0ZlfDPEZW5erCJWnRkrcd3sg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59f333f1c3a36872170101dc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Ashton-Jones","original_name":"Joanna Ashton-Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f333c092514122c1011254","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912785,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Silke Eggert","original_name":"Silke Eggert","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f333e192514122c1011287","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4158734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":803,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/arWJHIKUifnqSnRYfc4ljF8Pw3b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sj11DsSlw4Yb7dwG0WwgJ5bjt0c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
