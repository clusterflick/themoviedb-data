Starring Cheung Kwok Keung (The Pye-Dog) and 1980s and 90s action starlet Moon Lee, Only the Way reflects on life with sensitive insight and a gentle smile. Cheung Kwok Keung portrays a washed-out songwriter whose bad karma begins to catch up with him. His life goes into free fall as his girlfriend leaves him, his career goes downhill, and his mother (Siu Yam Yam, The Moss) passes away. All these setbacks make him live in even greater spite of the world until one day he encounters a Temple Street vendor (Tong Zhen) who introduces him to Buddhism.","popularity":0.417,"poster_path":"/df5myL6mMMQbZyzVjYjmOzRMvdA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2008-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only the Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Lee Choi-Fung","original_name":"李賽鳳","popularity":0.6186,"profile_path":"/2wTS5wK0tlbtHvNYm8AwiAG5PNf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59f41334c3a3682017008545","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Kwok-Keung","original_name":"張國強","popularity":0.7537,"profile_path":"/zNZcu16U8rbvJoT09dZx8eov3SX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59f41340c3a3681fc90089d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":575514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Shaw Yam-Yam","original_name":"邵音音","popularity":0.8173,"profile_path":"/w0CbId3WyKGjkLrt0vx5colsFFg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59f4134ac3a3681fbb0088c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1274608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Tse Suet-Sum","original_name":"Susan Tse","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/y8UXydgv9A0RywV9di5rCUtByh8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59f4135e9251414d05008a25","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1913173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dang Tak-Wing","original_name":"Dang Tak Wing","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f4131fc3a3681fbb00887b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1913173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dang Tak-Wing","original_name":"Dang Tak Wing","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f413129251414d20007bba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/df5myL6mMMQbZyzVjYjmOzRMvdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
