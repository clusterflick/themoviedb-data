With that success comes unique and exciting opportunities, like the chance to perform at the famed Farm Aid benefit… with its founders.  That’s what happened on this day in 1998, when Phish joined forces with Neil Young for an extended sit-in at Farm Aid that also featured a sit-in on “Moonlight in Vermont” from Willie Nelson and Paul Schaffer. After a few original songs, Young made his first appearance with the band after a “Runaway Jim” segued into “Arc.” Phish and Neil Young then played “Down By The River,” before the guest-filled “Moonlight in Vermont” came next in the set.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nzOX9LpRiPGNAzl0l7yhDo22xB1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phish: Farm Aid '98","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nzOX9LpRiPGNAzl0l7yhDo22xB1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
