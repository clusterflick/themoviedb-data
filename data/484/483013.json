This battalion is located in Mosul. I have 48 hours to make a decision. I decide to go. There, a friend gives me his old Hi8 camera with ten tapes. I am a photographer. I have never filmed anything. I have never seen war. For a whole month, I remain close to these soldiers and I film their everyday life, in spite of everything. Long waits, times out, endless wanderings through the city, looking for untraceable terrorists.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edouard Beau Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Hassan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bakhtiyar Haddad","original_name":"Bakhtiyar Haddad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59ee42d1c3a36871bc02eecf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco la Via","original_name":"Marco la Via","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59ee42d9c3a368752f02a962","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edouard Beau","original_name":"Edouard Beau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ee42e99251412a2901fe63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edouard Beau","original_name":"Edouard Beau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ee42f2c3a36871bc02ef1d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gil Savoy","original_name":"Gil Savoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ee430dc3a36851bd02b682","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911003,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeremy Gravayat","original_name":"Jeremy Gravayat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ee4301c3a3680ae9015e54","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ku","note":"Fid Marseille","release_date":"2009-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
