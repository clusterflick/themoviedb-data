Excellent, until one day she receives a disturbing phone call –anonymous, of course– in which the fidelity of Julio, her husband, is questioned. Without hesitation, Leonor decides to check with her own eyes that Julio is cheating on her with another woman. What follows is a whirlwind of crazy situations involving a maid who dreams of being the star of a soap opera; a bolero singer with two lovers: the pianist at the nightclub where she works and a prominent public official; the girlfriend of a television actor who introduces her suitor as her daughter, and a detective who arrives at the crime scene uncalled for.","popularity":0.1699,"poster_path":"/7NCYv2GPpwJvAIhh0eg6VxaLhQw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2002-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borrón
