Does this mean that in order to live to a ripe age we are condemned to swallow more and more drugs? What if there was another way?  For half a century, in Russia, Germany and the U.S., doctors and biologists have been exploring a different therapeutic approach: fasting. The results are amazing.  Soviet researchers have provided a body of clinical studies of exceptional health…only published in Russian, and thus unknown in the West. Young biologists from the University of Los Angeles have overturned conventional wisdom and used molecular biology to demonstrate the powerful effects of fasting.  This research suggests a wide-ranging potential, which could include treatments for the disease of the century, cancer. If these scientists are right, maybe our approach to disease and treatment will need a rethink.","popularity":0.4365,"poster_path":"/zHk1RHYRk7nLT8SlwlZ5410VPqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Via
