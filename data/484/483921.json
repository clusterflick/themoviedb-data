The film begins by hewing closely to the actual historical details of a group that escaped from an internment camp in 1943, but slowly turns to an alternative history in which the group inspires a general Indigenous insurrection that drives out settlers from the Top End of Australia.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/rmrU3K1Lbfr0g1Z47piVv8LOXV8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ngupelngamarrunu, Night Time Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2036122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Povinelli","original_name":"Elizabeth Povinelli","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/j1fI8JMf8DQV3QBzTykHguwSd4x.jpg","credit_id":"675a1e018a12ac802e8a35ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVZ4DYouHLeXVmNPHSIuUkXmRnw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g7BQflzkDIdsnGjEgWcn2o2M5lQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mdAGc6egmtqa0lmpXFezW6LZKp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z7fuTiIXYLII1JLCMexTJLlEzqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rmrU3K1Lbfr0g1Z47piVv8LOXV8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
