Blurring the line between fact and fiction, The Definition of Insanity was filmed over the course of 18 months, as a documentary crew follows Robert Margolis obsessively from one failed audition to another, recording in raw detail his every humiliation and small triumph as he searches for that elusive perfect role that will catapult his career into the next level. Just when it seems that he will be forced by family and financial pressures to give up everything he has worked for, he meets legendary filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich («The Last Picture Show», «Papermoon»). That encounter changes his life profoundly, but in a very different way than he had anticipated.","popularity":0.6094,"poster_path":"/tfqWFUnjJLjLgSPnQo7vxSCC0Kj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dirt Road Films","origin_country":""},{"id":53569,"logo_path":null,"name":"soap factory","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Definition of Insanity","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Margolis","original_name":"Robert Margolis","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"59eed97ec3a36828ee00bd8c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelli Barnett","original_name":"Kelli Barnett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"59eed98e925141245f038ca7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Krias","original_name":"Frank Krias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed99bc3a368752f0369fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Johnson","original_name":"Derek Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed9a89251412783037db6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","original_name":"Peter Bogdanovich","popularity":0.8766,"profile_path":"/m3aMMYzzEbqKEwGOyEPq7Rt1gAj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed9b2925141245f038cf0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed9c0c3a3680ae9021e15","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Margolis","original_name":"Robert Margolis","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59eed9ee9251413db9023f70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018878,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Matter","original_name":"Frank Matter","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/6AuUdBxaUpTxVHi0V6FRniLgyxW.jpg","credit_id":"59eed9fc9251413db9023f98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paula Atherton","original_name":"Paula Atherton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59eeda37c3a36871bc03bc16","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911282,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amy Fairchild","original_name":"Amy Fairchild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59eeda489251413db9023fe8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Margolis","original_name":"Robert Margolis","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59eeda0892514128e902ea55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018878,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Matter","original_name":"Frank Matter","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/6AuUdBxaUpTxVHi0V6FRniLgyxW.jpg","credit_id":"59eed9e1925141366d031acb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018878,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Matter","original_name":"Frank Matter","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/6AuUdBxaUpTxVHi0V6FRniLgyxW.jpg","credit_id":"59eeda21c3a36871bc03bbf6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309275","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXyI41iHRlocmdiFLINV3wa1nJr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tfqWFUnjJLjLgSPnQo7vxSCC0Kj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":842}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6203,"name":"loss"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":206711,"name":"obsessive quest"},{"id":208586,"name":"acting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
