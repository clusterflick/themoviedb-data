The trademark Aristocratic musical mayhem is rowdier than ever, but the band’s fifth studio album is truly like nothing else in their catalogue.  Of the inspiration for DUCK, The Aristocrats collectively explained, “It is the story of a web-footed Antarctic Island native fleeing a penguin policeman all the way to New York City… where considerable misadventure and danger await.” Of its genesis, they elaborated, “We’ve always been writing with a storytelling aspect in mind, and our live shows always include our stories behind the songs… But the stories had mainly been about us. Then Marco came into the studio with a song about a duck, and we all looked at each other and said, ‘What if all of stories for the songs on this album… happened to a duck? What’s that story about?’ And suddenly we had a concept album on our hands.”","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/s1FdDOLbVYKKTO5wkkz53QrRnCH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Aristocrats - The Making of DUCK","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Minnemann","original_name":"Marco Minnemann","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65deafce8e8702016103a7c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guthrie Govan","original_name":"Guthrie Govan","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/80hpwL6pr9wRsqtLTwT0pfnJZmw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65deafd6140bad018693b62a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Beller","original_name":"Bryan Beller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/461rkjD0XQTNTuNAbGzgRTNM1wM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65deafe15f4b730148f71e9f","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1815,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s1FdDOLbVYKKTO5wkkz53QrRnCH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1210}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
