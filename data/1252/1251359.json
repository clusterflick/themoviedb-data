This very special family must survive in the wilds of Botswana alongside some less-than-friendly neighbours: lions, wild dogs and hyenas. The competition for food is tough, and if they are going to make it they must learn a new skill - they must learn to fish. This is an epic family drama. With them every step of the way is local cameraman Brad Bestelink. Brad's 18-month journey following the lives of these secretive big cats offers a rare glimpse into an otherwise hidden world","popularity":0.979,"poster_path":"/kP84IL22gAhZrUkuXfnVJ4FfQZD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144640,"logo_path":"/6kl5tMuct7u3ej5myL4c9QQVSW1.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8090,"logo_path":"/ktzmUmVCQPjQGblWfDPBLKsIWKA.png","name":"BBC Earth","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":99272,"logo_path":"/xt9cawh63M0bkKrc0VvDtZ8q2sa.png","name":"Icon Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":177898,"logo_path":"/onwO6Mf6JjLrE1ef1hvDDUhYnxz.png","name":"Nat Geo Wild","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa's Fishing Leopards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Attenborough","original_name":"David Attenborough","popularity":1.4236,"profile_path":"/tt3LW3XftcvxOZtMXmIaJSWFN7y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65dea5ceb76cbb017dd80811","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Bestelink","original_name":"Brad Bestelink","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/75LxxftRilWUQyjMuxfxOW1IG2z.jpg","credit_id":"65deac32d5dbc2017c57b45b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Gooder","original_name":"Steve Gooder","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dea603109cd0014b19d520","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760357,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Goodchild","original_name":"William Goodchild","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5n8RLaqGOjI9jPhJqMMYiK6ZudW.jpg","credit_id":"65dea648109cd0014b19d53d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Bestelink","original_name":"Brad Bestelink","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/75LxxftRilWUQyjMuxfxOW1IG2z.jpg","credit_id":"65dea5f08e870200c8035ef6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Bestelink","original_name":"Brad Bestelink","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/75LxxftRilWUQyjMuxfxOW1IG2z.jpg","credit_id":"6631564548333a012a91c344","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560145,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Uren","original_name":"Richard Uren","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/8UsbcSHYmYjdMNLoyGoLUrORNqh.jpg","credit_id":"66315686b234b90121e5c47b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5816642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8BxYv9Za494hmYaL8A7N5y15TQ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1489,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pYF6yIchI1uYIZKoQ3dCmD8KprF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2647}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kP84IL22gAhZrUkuXfnVJ4FfQZD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4478,"name":"leopard"},{"id":251493,"name":"big cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
