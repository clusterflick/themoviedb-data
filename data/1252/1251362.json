The Pineapple Thief revel in opposing forces. Muscle and fragility. Chaos and precision. Distorted introspection and warm, dreamlike expanse. Conceived in 1999 by Bruce Soord, the progressive quartet underwent a rebirth in 2017 with the arrival of Gavin Harrison on drums. Completed by bassist Jon Sykes and keyboardist Steve Kitch, they’ve honed a lean yet lush, quietly timeless sound that soars on It Leads To This.  Comprising eight fat-free epics – mixing rock urgency with delicate atmospherics, pensive keys and captivating melodies – it finds Soord looking back and fearing for the world his children will inherit. His lyrics also drew from literature: accounts of Ancient Rome, John Williams’ classic Stoner and epistolary Augustus. All conveyed through Soord’s fragile yet penetrative tenor, nodding to storytellers like Nick Drake, Thom Yorke and Katatonia’s Jonas Renkse.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/8FzyY9JWpogsvklhdXbQyjV4BWw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pineapple Thief: It Leads To This","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2413547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Soord","original_name":"Bruce Soord","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65dea74b98f1f1017d9913e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Harrison","original_name":"Gavin Harrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/glygKNgTnfrdVJevsINQoQipzA3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65dea757b76cbb017dd80b38","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Sykes","original_name":"Jon Sykes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65dea76cd5dbc2017c57adac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Kitch","original_name":"Steve Kitch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65dea77a5f4b730185f79acd","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u3qoqIpdaSZmBkVhLXUZAX41MJJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1740,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8FzyY9JWpogsvklhdXbQyjV4BWw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1160}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
