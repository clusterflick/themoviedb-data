It was the opportunity to make a film on the ancestors with M'hamed Issiakhem. He designed glass plates on the basis of my texts. Then we had actors collaborate. It was a film which cost us a total of 300 dinars, proof that we could do work for television without too much money. We won two first international prizes at the Belgrade festival. We left the original of the film with the Egyptians in Alexandria and they lost it. We kept a copy but over time I wonder what happened to it, because there is no not even had a screening, they say it still exists, but I don't know in what state.\" Kateb Yacine, July 28, 1986, interview with Arlette Casas.","popularity":0.3034,"poster_path":"/iKvMmuMuZ2kE4ZpfaoyKeJ4PwuV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161896,"logo_path":"/rY5w8KTUVgNSjnInyHwYh9JlPLb.png","name":"Radiodiffusion Télévision Algérienne (RTA)","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July Dust","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4562328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naïma El Medhi","original_name":"Naïma El Medhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65dea64b98f1f1017d991201","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4562329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samir Ben Chérifa","original_name":"Samir Ben Chérifa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65dea6955f4b730185f79894","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4562324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"El-Hachemi Chérif","original_name":"El-Hachemi Chérif","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/tbdzgGi1yBwlli2W6Pedkx05JuE.jpg","credit_id":"65dea53198f1f1016498d075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2556768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kateb Yacine","original_name":"Kateb Yacine","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":"/uVPkEscGYqZQ8cXAaUkscXbtZ5M.jpg","credit_id":"65dea53db76cbb017dd806b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4561131,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"M'hamed Issiakhem","original_name":"M'hamed Issiakhem","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/8FQZAhyHUXDfwDXO1vKijRO3cVq.jpg","credit_id":"65dea5d87f2d4a017c1ee076","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4561131,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"M'hamed Issiakhem","original_name":"M'hamed Issiakhem","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/8FQZAhyHUXDfwDXO1vKijRO3cVq.jpg","credit_id":"65dea5e58c44b9017c138d84","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rf6SUcEdS0AWb1p1YHWzJnly1ID.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKvMmuMuZ2kE4ZpfaoyKeJ4PwuV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zCNGn3LUS1WZQTn4cy3kzT7qkSu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"},{"id":293298,"name":"panafricanism"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":317459,"name":"experimental movie"},{"id":329357,"name":"revolutionary poetry"},{"id":329359,"name":"chouhada"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
