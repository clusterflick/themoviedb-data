Its rhythmic cadence, vivid imagery, and emotional depth offer a rich tapestry for filmmakers to weave their visual narratives. Animator STEP C., narrative filmmaker Chu Hoi Ying, analogue film artist Jolene Mok, and documentarian Lee Wai Shing were asked to choose a contemporary Chinese-language poem written by a local writer, then visualise it using their personal cinematic language. The resulting shorts showcase the diversity of Hong Kong moving image practice, with unique approaches to medium, storytelling, cinematography, and sound.","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":141073,"logo_path":null,"name":"M+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poetry on Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1674433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedwig Tam","original_name":"談善言","popularity":0.4002,"profile_path":"/ynHaIWDDZ9saWz7xC7QG78XUCEJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65df46fa4d23dd0149a06c08","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3297497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Step C.","original_name":"Step C.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n36Lf23zNOTol5rXVdhkIoDUjVp.jpg","credit_id":"65df46ab98f1f1017d99ea21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2470930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hoi-Ying Chu","original_name":"Hoi Ying Chu","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/kFuBqeehPO65ycLGQD8HpmLQPmh.jpg","credit_id":"65df462a8c44b9017c14b079","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4149661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Wai Shing","original_name":"Lee Wai Shing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df467c7614210185d61f58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jolene Mok","original_name":"Jolene Mok","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df46bd98f1f1014a98c9f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
