The Bagabuzi and Banyamazi are living a cordial harmony, when in 2017, when the global shortage of drinking water makes life difficult, the decontamination of the springs becomes more complicated. A deaf antagonism settles in between the two communities.  In this context of mutual mistrust and hatred, unbeknownst to their families, Nijimbere (a Mugabuzi) and Kamikazi (a Munyamazi) love each other and communicate regularly with the complicity of Mizero, Nijimbere's cousin. But circumstances will soon change the course of their lives and the entire community.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BI","name":"Burundi"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kinyarwanda","iso_639_1":"rw","name":"Kinyarwanda"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Mashoka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4561401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Marie Ndihokubwayo","original_name":"Jean Marie Ndihokubwayo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65de310b7776f0017c11ed7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pascal Capitolin","original_name":"Pascal Capitolin","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65de311feea34d014ab125ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I Mashoka by Jean Marie Ndihokubwayo and Pascal Capitolin","key":"9EIMcGw48YM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-03T05:15:29.000Z","id":"65de316124b3330185b7d32a"}]}}}
