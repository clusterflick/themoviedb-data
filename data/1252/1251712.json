On a stormy night, she seeks shelter in the garden of a temporarily unoccupied house. However, that same night, the owners of the house, João and Sandra, return to their home. Sensitized by the difficult situation of Rosa and her baby and dominated by her maternal instinct (not yet realized), Sandra allows the “invaders” to remain in the garden. Shortly afterwards, she ends up welcoming mother and daughter into the house. In the following days, conflicts erupt due to the social abyss that separates the characters, heightened by a painful memory of Rosa and João’s childhoods.","popularity":0.1056,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90934,"logo_path":"/fUkFSE2hzqpFiUUUCvG3yNgdwLx.png","name":"Prana Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Daughter of the Flood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel da Costa Franco","original_name":"Miguel da Costa Franco","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df9e1704b5960186ed25f7","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":944346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Gerbase","original_name":"Carlos Gerbase","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":"/idGm69imTZXQJXXAmdVazRLEcv3.jpg","credit_id":"65df9dfe98f1f1017d9a2da1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel da Costa Franco","original_name":"Miguel da Costa Franco","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df9e1198f1f1017d9a2dae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":944346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Gerbase","original_name":"Carlos Gerbase","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":"/idGm69imTZXQJXXAmdVazRLEcv3.jpg","credit_id":"65df9e03b7abb50163ac435b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1774516,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luciana Tomasi","original_name":"Luciana Tomasi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/Mswv7Ei4ULMGzCOTb76h9Ro3IW.jpg","credit_id":"65df9e394d23dd017fa0b196","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
