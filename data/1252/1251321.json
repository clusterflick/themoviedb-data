It’s spring 2006 and the university corridors are bristling with political activity. Students are getting ready for elections, professors are also voting for deans, while a group of engineering students is totally engrossed in preparing for an international competition and doesn’t seem to notice any of this. They all want a better public university system, but how can they achieve it? We witness a crisis in the making. When students decide to occupy the university, it turns into a standoff between the government, professors and students. Finally, as Professor Vokos observes, “perhaps we’re afraid of facing reality.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tu1nWvyqykuZNh69PD6xG6qUh5w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2006-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living and Learning: Springtime at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apostolos Karakasis","original_name":"Απόστολος Καρακάσης","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/e26cWEFz17p75TIS7z6PT9JCEN4.jpg","credit_id":"65de828f98f1f1016498b16e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apostolos Karakasis","original_name":"Απόστολος Καρακάσης","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/e26cWEFz17p75TIS7z6PT9JCEN4.jpg","credit_id":"65de827c5f4b730185f7337a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apostolos Karakasis","original_name":"Απόστολος Καρακάσης","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/e26cWEFz17p75TIS7z6PT9JCEN4.jpg","credit_id":"65de829f8c44b9017c132bd9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerie Kontakos","original_name":"Valerie Kontakos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65de8252b39e3501862f542e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apostolos Karakasis","original_name":"Απόστολος Καρακάσης","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/e26cWEFz17p75TIS7z6PT9JCEN4.jpg","credit_id":"65de82865f4b730185f73390","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tu1nWvyqykuZNh69PD6xG6qUh5w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
