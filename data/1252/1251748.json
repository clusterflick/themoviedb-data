It is said to be at the beginning of the cosmos and universe--from it hatched our beloved seas, earth, oxygen, sun, moon, ritual and spirit. Though the tale of the Cosmic Egg has been told in many cultures and civilizations from around the world, even on all five continents, ink on glass illustrates this dimly coloured adaptation, verging many ideas from different cultures, instead of holding true to only one, celebrating the human experience not as a singularity, but as a whole.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cosmic Egg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4563427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bianca Shonee Arroyo-Kreimes","original_name":"Bianca Shonee Arroyo-Kreimes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dfb105e8131d0185d4ca95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"GIRAF 15 Festival of Independent Animation","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
