The spectator is instigated to enter the film and be submitted to games of shapes and perspectives. Spaces that simultaneously create a connection and a separation, a continuity and an interruption, the bridge between heaven and earth. Real places that transform into parallel worlds, devoid of a narrative but filled with utopia, spontaneity and freedom.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Degrau a Grau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938724,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugo França","original_name":"Hugo França","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df51f9140bad01499346f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938724,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugo França","original_name":"Hugo França","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df5215140bad018694af0e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4563003,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"CAROLINA ROCHA","original_name":"CAROLINA ROCHA","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df52448e870201610423e5","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
