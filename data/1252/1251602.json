Round wheels and targets similar to him seem to arouse the interest of this main character.  The atmosphere is thundery, thunderous. It reminds of the cyclopean thunder demons from the \"Theogony\" of the ancient Greek poet Hesiod.  KYKLOP (2023) is another autonomous part of the film cycle by Telemach Wiesinger and Alexander Grebtschenko that began with TURBULENCE (2022) and its pairs of mechanical wings.","popularity":0.2754,"poster_path":"/obSEtN19Bcv2BJctvWFgQvF8kHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Experimental","title":"Kyklop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telemach Wiesinger","original_name":"Telemach Wiesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df50818c44b9016313c7e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telemach Wiesinger","original_name":"Telemach Wiesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df52989638640162d7d13c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4563009,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Grebtschenko","original_name":"Alexander Grebtschenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df52bd140bad018694afc9","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telemach Wiesinger","original_name":"Telemach Wiesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df57efb76cbb017dd90d94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telemach Wiesinger","original_name":"Telemach Wiesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df5a358e870201840524c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":790,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Ztj6UG6POs0UuvdXIBCDyoykZ8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1406}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obSEtN19Bcv2BJctvWFgQvF8kHv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4484,"name":"eye"},{"id":161893,"name":"cyclops"},{"id":224181,"name":"objects"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
