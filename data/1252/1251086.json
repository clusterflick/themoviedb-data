All I know about these harsh landscapes I learned from books written by the hand that burned these mountains. I try to undo the colonial myths engraved into my memory, but the hills escape my gaze. Do you think I, too, have become the white djinn spoken of by the legends surrounding our martyrs? Avant Seriana is an essay film shot in Super 8 in the Aur√®s region of Algeria. Observing the landscapes of my native land, I realize that they are divided into several images and times. Two different countries are formed : the Algeria of the mountains and an imaginary one born of the tales I've read in colonial archives. My gaze no longer belongs to the places where I was hoping to return to my roots.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/bzj9fwU5vhxnm29k0SVaskTnkr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"before seriana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2865663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samy Benammar","original_name":"Samy Benammar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4raoIjT87ODRNkqMfN2VIl5fBn.jpg","credit_id":"65de0cef719aeb017be82f3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzj9fwU5vhxnm29k0SVaskTnkr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI London Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
