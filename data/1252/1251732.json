He did everything to make Belarusians feel like a full-fledged people. This is a figure that cannot be reduced by anything from the height of modernity. But the weight of recognition, inclusion in the ranks of the classics leads to petrification of the face. The authors of the film remove this petrification - verses sound throughout the film. Patriotic songs that sing the praises of Belarus and our people, awaken them from historical apathy and eternal longing. Mystics who whisper about the revival of the past that sleeps in the mound. And intimate and lyrical, filled with intimate beauty, eternal sensuality and lust for life.","popularity":0.1944,"poster_path":"/vNCqkC9Ee1YSoxPSUzaf4BqrRKm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yanka Kupala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Asliuk","original_name":"Victor Asliuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dfa90a6f8d95018687cf90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27611303","wikidata_id":"Q91092814","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNCqkC9Ee1YSoxPSUzaf4BqrRKm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238051,"name":"belarus"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"be","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
