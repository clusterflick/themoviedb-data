Surviving fighter aces from all sides in the conflict -- British, American, German, Russian, Japanese and many other nationalities -- now share their experiences -- and provide their own, exclusive, vivid and graphic first hand accounts of what it was really like to be a fighter pilot in some of the greatest air battles the world has ever known. This extraordinary series is fully illustrated with the pick of air combat footage shot at the height of raging dogfights, or as fighter interceptors attack bomber formations. You'll relive aeriel combat as the Aces themselves experienced it -- through the gun-sights of their Spitfires, Mustangs, Me 109s and Zeros.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":"/kYFBLum7E0vZ7jJLYU57hLxPh3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Questar","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":299,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunters in the Sky: Fighter Aces of WWII","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4563253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Holbrook","original_name":"Hal Holbrook","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65df853f4d23dd017fa0a3a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488778,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chip Cronkite","original_name":"Chip Cronkite","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/igaAYroFLtBIXuTdwHnc1Jwna6n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65df854c35db450186cfa2da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4563262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Mollow Mason, Jr","original_name":"Herbert Mollow Mason, Jr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Director","credit_id":"65df85ec7f2d4a018667c029","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kYFBLum7E0vZ7jJLYU57hLxPh3A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
