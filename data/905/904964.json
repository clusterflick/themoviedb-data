In engaging in intellectual exchanges before the camera, Stefan Römer is able to develop a special filmic mode of reflecting on the state of international contemporary art.  The film essay »Conceptual Paradise: There Is a Place for Sophistication« traces out the debates that allowed the intellectual art movement of Conceptual art to emerge in the 1960s and led to the most relevant questions in art today. The artists speak about their own artistic practices and the socio-historical development of the various conceptual movements. In so doing, it becomes clear that there can be no one valid definition of conceptual art, since a  permanent engagement also makes up its theoretical and philosophical complexity, including for example the question of whether there can be art without an object.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/azYIcbEZ8uLPApwxX2I2GDNK43a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conceptual Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Römer","original_name":"Stefan Römer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3e2bdd37197002a1a7494","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Römer","original_name":"Stefan Römer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3e2ac6332f7002b28ce18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2713242","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/azYIcbEZ8uLPApwxX2I2GDNK43a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
