In the summer of 2010, Almborg and a group of eleven strangers of varying ages and backgrounds traveled to a small, uninhabited island off the coast of Sweden. Their mission was to collaboratively build a wooden structure without plans or blueprints and while on the island they would not communicate using spoken or written language. Three individuals in the group were responsible for documenting the process, however, their task was similarly governed by rules: they could film no more than 30 minutes of activity per day. The resulting film explores the limits of language and the relationship between communication and community.","popularity":0.0243,"poster_path":"/l0HtpUgsHwSh7X66Tjgm8XyrK7p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing is left to tell","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2077370,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Iga Mikler","original_name":"Iga Mikler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3958ba3d02700629c682f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuel Almborg","original_name":"Emanuel Almborg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a394e99d6e33004582c2ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Kinkle","original_name":"Jeff Kinkle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e5a6b22d9375008a28c66a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuel Almborg","original_name":"Emanuel Almborg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e5a6cfa410c8001cd7b4ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pLSHLF6kELpJHJd91X9X7ozLnMl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0HtpUgsHwSh7X66Tjgm8XyrK7p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
