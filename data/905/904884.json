To this day, the Pilgrim Fathers are a glorified symbol of American virtue.  In search of autonomy and with the desire to preserve their cultural identity, a group of English Puritans left their Dutch refuge in 1620 to set off for the New World. That voyage is not just a tale of a religious community bravely going their own way; the events of those days would have a major impact on the course of modern history.  The rules and regulations of the Mayflower Compact that the Pilgrim Fathers, religious sectarians, abided by, became the secular prototype for the constitution of the United States of America; a social contract that would serve as an example for many other national constitutions during the European age of civil society and thereafter.","popularity":0.8683,"poster_path":"/q5GOKeoKCCaDL1h1tcv2GmioPWj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":71160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pro TV Produktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey Into the Unknown: William Bradford And The Pilgrim Fathers","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2430363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Weeden","original_name":"David Weeden","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chief Massasoit","credit_id":"61a3c698869e750093ebf044","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Barrett","original_name":"Steve Barrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"John Carver","credit_id":"61a3c6c7c5c1ef0094a4a9e0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.Hunter Heinlen","original_name":"J.Hunter Heinlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"William Bradford","credit_id":"61a80bbee267de006425d595","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50639,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jürgen Herrmann","original_name":"Jürgen Herrmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3c5c200508a002c1c81f4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2532667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf Truchsess von Wetzhausen","original_name":"Wolf Truchsess von Wetzhausen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3c5530582240042b0b2b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJIA71PgCOMLzIMKQ4ihqL3BMxk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q5GOKeoKCCaDL1h1tcv2GmioPWj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8008,"name":"pilgrim"},{"id":8982,"name":"plymouth"},{"id":176796,"name":"mayflower pilgrims"},{"id":207941,"name":"17th century"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Journey Into the Unknown - William Bradford And The Pilgrim Fathers","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
