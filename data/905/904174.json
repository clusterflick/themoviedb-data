Sondheim, seated at a piano, focuses on the arrangement of his score, singing excerpts from the show's songs as examples. Weidman focuses on his text and the meaning of individual sequences. Scenic designer Loren Sherman, who designed the set for the 1990 Off-Broadway production of the show at Playwrights Horizons, displays his model for the set and offers advice on dealing with the scenic design challenges presented by the show. Each man appears separately and addresses the camera directly, with no interviewer present.","popularity":0.5158,"poster_path":"/9ckvCyirvhLvjPGsOIMlHelOaYd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165272,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTI Music Theatre International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assassins: A Conversationpiece","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Sondheim","original_name":"Stephen Sondheim","popularity":0.5287,"profile_path":"/vRMGsYYDIVpoyCIQ65wZ6femLly.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61a1f675de11e500432bbb2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Weidman","original_name":"John Weidman","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61a1f684de11e500630b531e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3326430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loren Sherman","original_name":"Loren Sherman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61a1f6932495ab0043f9741a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3326435,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Daube","original_name":"Daniel Daube","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a1f6ced133240044cf86ea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Held","original_name":"Karl Held","popularity":0.2144,"profile_path":"/fEEE8MpwZLYzYEIKqPJOLUbRu8i.jpg","credit_id":"61a1f6c485c0a20090b4ece2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356928,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Kosmaczewski","original_name":"John Kosmaczewski","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a1f6b66f43ec00451693c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Englander","original_name":"Roger Englander","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a1f6a97f1d830044a54b09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ckvCyirvhLvjPGsOIMlHelOaYd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
