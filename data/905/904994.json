Since his childhood, the villagers have called him whenever they’ve been plagued by illness and suffering. One day, when he is asked to heal a sick man, his healing powers no longer work. Neither his trance-like recitation of mantras nor the sacrifice of a rooster has any effect. The gods don’t hear him. Has he become too old to be a healer? In tranquil and contemplative images, AAKHAT tells the story of a shaman who is facing the end of his life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/d4PDzYWdXpCa70nhdCKZ88CU1YZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divination","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nar Bahadur Gaha Magar","original_name":"Nar Bahadur Gaha Magar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61a3ee16383df20064759b5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mem Bahadur Gharti Magar","original_name":"Mem Bahadur Gharti Magar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61a3ee1f3dc313002d25176d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ganesh Gaha Magar","original_name":"Ganesh Gaha Magar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61a3ee26b458b80046e493d4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gopal Acharya","original_name":"Gopal Acharya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3ee5000508a006670a241","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2479931,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ankit Poudel","original_name":"Ankit Poudel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3ee65e2bca80064cb028c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Prem Prasad Adhikary","original_name":"Prem Prasad Adhikary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3ee78869e750093ec377a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328440,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandeep Shrestha","original_name":"Sandeep Shrestha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3ee6d8a0e9b0044862e8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gopal Acharya","original_name":"Gopal Acharya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3ee57b458b80092163748","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1598,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d4PDzYWdXpCa70nhdCKZ88CU1YZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
