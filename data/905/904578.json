One night, he frantically writes a short novel on a wine trip between France and Spain. His story goes unnoticed until a film producer decides to adapt it for cinema. This unexpected turn leads Thierry to pair with actor José Garcia, Joël Dupuch and a small film crew. Together, they will engage in an initiating wine trip to follow the map outlined in Thierry’s novel. With a half-broken vintage mini-cooper, a Don Quixote sculpture and 2,000 km of road, they will attempt to reach the Spanish region of La Mancha to bring Thierry’s novel to life.","popularity":0.2445,"poster_path":"/bgf3zvRojBiLrW0KQy2pPHxYg9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waiting for
