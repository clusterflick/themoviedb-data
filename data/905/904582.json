The film explores the characters’ individual relationships with ancient forests, and why it’s imperative we collectively protect them. It touches on potential solutions, like a transition away from old-growth in the future of logging, and Indigenous sovereignty.","popularity":0.5871,"poster_path":"/cOPRFwwJxW5gp3967unbyBl7xiT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before They Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3327427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cam McArthur","original_name":"Cam McArthur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a2ccf39d6e33004581b91b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3327430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Momme Halbe","original_name":"Momme Halbe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a2cd0e869e750093ea7108","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3327428,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rene Gauthier","original_name":"Rene Gauthier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a2cd017f2d4a0062010cd0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cOPRFwwJxW5gp3967unbyBl7xiT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1120,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGhLpiLFMh2juEwrhyTG0I0kxw9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":744},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hjT1IuHpFQZpFxUtatRkxS0rQdI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a0IyTxnO2Zsah9PaI63XEMyJvZo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/77IDB44eZ08WfNJsdJ1UodkgYYT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zXJoqLyelvX7b0iBKPxPfWGjUbJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":163118,"name":"social justice"},{"id":287173,"name":"fairy creek"},{"id":287174,"name":"ada'itsx"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ecologyst Films presents \"Before They Fall\" | Official Teaser","key":"EbrVs1frMqs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-22T19:00:04.000Z","id":"61a2cd4585c0a20090b62ec0"}]}}}
