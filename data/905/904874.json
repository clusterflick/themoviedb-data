Set in the wild forests of ‘No-man’s-land.’\r Glamorised by Hollywood and villainised by ancestral folklore, the wolverine is both a fabled icon of the Northern Hemisphere and a modern-day superhero. Our heroine of this story, Freya, is a 3-year-old female wolverine – shy and elusive and rarely caught on camera, she inhabits a mysterious and unforgiving world – deep in the rugged wilderness between Russia and Finland. Freya thrives in ‘No-man’s land’ – so named for good reason; it’s a remote and remorseless habitat; no man could survive here","popularity":0.1964,"poster_path":"/3ZUiNjaNwCNbfrZoB5d25H9FdsA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Rock Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10331,"logo_path":"/iyUmqBwQpsWOKw5uZ0j0DI5FN9t.png","name":"Terra Mater Factual Studios","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolverine: One Tough Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4110752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Bolette Skov Nielsen","original_name":"Anja Bolette Skov Nielsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6489291bd2b20900ca21b57e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Sletten","original_name":"Alexander Sletten","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3bd07134d580043412e03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kira Ivanoff","original_name":"Kira Ivanoff","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/tehsFdJXWA8FtnR2tocOKwcZNKC.jpg","credit_id":"61a3bd17180dea00987f519c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21072006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/61wniESI6pAANLxyFOLT243ZCfw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3ZUiNjaNwCNbfrZoB5d25H9FdsA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sCDKmeEH6vibABh9OIN3taxx2pQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Smithsonian Channel","release_date":"2021-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
