Situated on the border with Iraq, north-west of the city of Abadan, which is only 53 kilometres distant from the Persian Gulf and near the Iraqi-Iran border, Shalamcheh was one of the main Iraqi troop sites at the time of the war against Iran. Approximately 50,000 Iranians died fighting around the town. Today Shalamcheh is a gateway for pilgrims headed to Karbala, a city located in central Iraq, south-west of Baghdad. Considered a holy city by Shia Muslims, home to the Imam Hussain Shrine, tens of millions of pilgrims visit Karbala twice a year.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safe Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Payam Parsafar","original_name":"Payam Parsafar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fc8f1c925141643c01fd5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
