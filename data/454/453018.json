It tells the story of a thoroughly modern family of three members. In their struggle for money, the parents fail to devote much time or attention to their five-year-old daughter, Anja. They do not have the time or patience to explain things to her and they give her what she wants just to ‘buy some peace’. “Brother for a Day” at first glance appears to be a story of different nationalities; in fact, it refers to the divide between the child’s world and the world of adults.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/bS2AtgAAn1lPemSJDCVpGkSlGGM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lunar Produkcija","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2016-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brother for a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Ние и тие","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Mihajlovski","original_name":"Toni Mihajlovski","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/rLgAMpy5SfYjefMx9CUHi6Nnb8L.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Father","credit_id":"58f7a0bfc3a3686084000263","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamka Tocinovski","original_name":"Kamka Tocinovski","popularity":0.2978,"profile_path":"/e5YdMbkH1AspZHehheK9SwFhM2P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"58f7a0cac3a36860be000244","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Bošković","original_name":"Monika Bošković","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58f7a0d5c3a36860e600024e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360249,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dimo Popov","original_name":"Dimo Popov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7a0ff9251416a670001b6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stojan Vujičikj","original_name":"Stojan Vujicic","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7a111c3a36860d3000262","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685170,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eva Kamchevska","original_name":"Eva Kamchevska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7a1259251416a860001fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4895344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"mk","file_path":"/bS2AtgAAn1lPemSJDCVpGkSlGGM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
