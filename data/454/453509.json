The negative was saved out of the wreck and presents a remarkable photographic illusion, inasmuch as one who looks at it gets the effect at the end of the picture, of a fire engine at full tilt dashing directly toward him.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1897-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atlantic City Fire Department","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0217263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1897-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
