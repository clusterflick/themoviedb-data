DeMille (brother of Cecil B.) Peggy Shannon plays Wanda Kelly, the daughter of a disgraced politician. Reduced to working as a switchboard operator, Wanda is privy to the many secrets and indiscretions of the clients of a big-city hotel. She also finds romance in the form of handsome Tom Blake (Richard Arlen). The huge cast of characters comes in handy for the film's multitude of subplots, none of which ever get their wires crossed. Peggy Shannon acquits herself nicely in her first major role, but by the end of the decade her career was in decline.","popularity":0.3681,"poster_path":"/4i0kJUv9lXJCBtdpyM8qiz2jftN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A girl's struggle for revenge and against love!","title":"The Secret Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Arlen","original_name":"Richard Arlen","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/dDr230NdMlxt4BC0OxwG0pJZV7t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tom Blake","credit_id":"58fcab53c3a36879be0216e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Shannon","original_name":"Peggy Shannon","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/zBZnCypoaIJ6c85b4v4uZQPdl1w.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wanda Kelly","credit_id":"58fcab6192514163f5020fa0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William B.
