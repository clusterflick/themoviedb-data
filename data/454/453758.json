The professor, Sophie’s mentor and the medical administrator of the facility, sees Sophie’s obsession with her faces and brings the two women together. As the doctor-patient relationship develops, Sophie learns that Mrs. Erme shares her obsession with her face, and furthermore, discovers that Mrs. Erme’s illness is closely connected to this obsession. Through investigation and the torture of her own dreams, Sophie learns that Mrs. Erme had a son, who at the age of ten died from chicken pox, while his mother was too afraid to ruin her face by getting infected by the disease.","popularity":0.1863,"poster_path":"/9R3GkrYMFGV7ZoLDMpwygYjBT0w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Award Film & Video","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Rubin","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Г-ѓа Ерме","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofija Kunovska","original_name":"Sofija Kunovska","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/szrBaL3DW47pF2PUJ8rYE2uEPZe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Rubin","credit_id":"58fcc1cac3a36879f401ed9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragana Kostadinovska","original_name":"Dragana Kostadinovska","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/bfyzAXfLAzNJyv2wnMBJ8I2CzYL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"58fcc194c3a3687a0301fa29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petre Arsovski","original_name":"Petre Arsovski","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/3dL4XfpvcSTpXoGrM3zdygLU3Lc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Professor","credit_id":"58fcc1a7c3a36879840228b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5277400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emra Kurtišova","original_name":"Emra Kurtišova","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Medicinska sestra","credit_id":"67eacc3c0e2ac292dc2448b9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kostadin Anastasov","original_name":"Kostadin Anastasov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fcc1e3c3a36879db0234e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy de Maupassant","original_name":"Guy de Maupassant","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/5TnxaJOQcUI3ysXUvstMXfm4bJP.jpg","credit_id":"58fcc20592514163ec021d07","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2182027","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1403,"iso_639_1":"mk","file_path":"/9R3GkrYMFGV7ZoLDMpwygYjBT0w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":992}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
