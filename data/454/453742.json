The work links cinematic shooting and military warfare together, implicating Germany’s role in the operation. This has been screened in the past as a dual-channel work. But in this case it has been re-purposed by the artist as a split screen film. (KG)  From e-flux:\r Abstract presents a scenario in which the violence of warfare and the violence of aesthetics twist around each other. The two-channel video visits the site where Steyerl’s friend Andrea Wolf was killed in 1998, but through a prism that refracts cinematic language against the weapons that killed her friend. As the site and circumstances of her death fold into the act of witnessing it from a distance, the ethical burden of identifying those responsible also appears to live and die with the debris that still remains at the site of the helicopter attack.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/fhzmFn85Jz2ZPzj3Nz33VSsozF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abstract","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hito Steyerl","original_name":"Hito Steyerl","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dL8oPhT9JdVYfPqvGUK8CrODNgY.jpg","credit_id":"58fcab36c3a3687a2502034b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fhzmFn85Jz2ZPzj3Nz33VSsozF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
