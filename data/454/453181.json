The majority of the extant work on North Korea are based on interviews with 'defectors,' featuring its dark side and the three 'monsters,' Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un.

Her life which spans the 20th and 21st centuries and the three countries guide her to tell stories of North Korea in political and historical context. A deeply personal film with new insight.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vt6Tdp7jQzcAdWTmlGq7RYytMru.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People are the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","original_name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/670PR0KiJXJXqM4aM2UBIwsPaLA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"58f8f08a9251415bfd00bc83","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","original_name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/670PR0KiJXJXqM4aM2UBIwsPaLA.jpg","credit_id":"58f8f0559251415bf900bdfd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","original_name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/670PR0KiJXJXqM4aM2UBIwsPaLA.jpg","credit_id":"58f8f05e9251415c5900bd37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4074360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1116,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vt6Tdp7jQzcAdWTmlGq7RYytMru.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":784}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
