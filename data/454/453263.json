But after a gory initiation by immortal gang leader Bop (Ryan Linkof), she has developed not only a twisted blood-lust, but a desperate addiction to fame and youth. She needs to be loved in order to live. And now, in the year 2205, after marauding the streets with her gang of Warlords for over 200 years, Tipsy must find new ways to be adored. Her life is a dizzying tale of excess and depravity.
