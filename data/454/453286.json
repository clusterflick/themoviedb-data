When the bank threatens to close it, the workers fear that they will soon be forced out of their jobs. The Royal's property master, Bob Parker (Bud Flanagan), recruits the rest of the staff to stage a benefit gala.

Meanwhile, they seek investors who can keep the Theatre Royal and its staff in business permanently.","popularity":0.2287,"poster_path":"/fCMNoPNbKPu4LRm8nAwiW9YzBzX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14197,"logo_path":null,"name":"British National Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1943-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theatre Royal","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Flanagan","original_name":"Bud Flanagan","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Bob Parker","credit_id":"58f9c815c3a3687c73007bdb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chesney Allen","original_name":"Chesney Allen","popularity":0.1024,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gordon Maxwell","credit_id":"58f9c830925141587d007f3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2550323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Dexter","original_name":"Peggy Dexter","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Connie Webster","credit_id":"6016ac29976a23003ca50cce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Sherwood","original_name":"Lydia Sherwood","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/rPUWOwyqmZN5rVAOg3SvVxyUwbD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Claudia Brent","credit_id":"6016ac3a87a27a0045e1ae4e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horace Kenney","original_name":"Horace Kenney","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"George","credit_id":"6016ac4dcb802800400ac3db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Rhodes","original_name":"Marjorie Rhodes","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/h1Jn0YMWgZfyb5AspQb305prB4v.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Agnes","credit_id":"6016ac5daafebd003fd9ed2d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finlay Currie","original_name":"Finlay Currie","popularity":0.5696,"profile_path":"/okHKOxm5wmFu513NsK3JNI7fMkr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Clement J.
