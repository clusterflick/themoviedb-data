The film follows two families on Pine Ridge as they go about their daily activities over the course of a single summer. They attend rodeos, shoot clay pigeons, and participate in pow wows. Family members get married, have children, and celebrate the 4th of July. All the while, the difficult, often intractable realities of modern reservation life threaten to encroach upon them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oyate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dam Girmus","original_name":"Dam Girmus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fd41bc925141643c027afc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5812270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du RÃ©el","release_date":"2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Big Sky Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
