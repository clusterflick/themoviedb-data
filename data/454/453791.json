Each car not only runs on tracks but also has a set of tracks over its top, permitting an oncoming car to go over it. The camera was placed close to a platform on which the passenger-laden train ran, and the over-and-under vehicle demonstrated its unusual capabilities several times.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1905-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leap Frog Railway, Coney Island","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Stern's Duplex Railway","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3369950","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1905-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
