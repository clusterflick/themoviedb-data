Born in 1967, Barry Minkow went on to set up a highly successful carpet cleaning company but was imprisoned in 1988 for one of the world's largest investment and accounting frauds through a Ponzi scheme. The scheme that Minkow set up is often used as a case study in accounting fraud. He was released from prison and went on to be a pastor and fraud investigator. Imprisoned again in 2011 for securities fraud and, in 2014, after pleading guilty to a multitude of charges including defrauding the federal government, Minkow currently owes more than $600 million in restitution.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/n8SiMjsqfXkAUQ4SKpdcBpbUCaA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Redemption Isn't Enough","title":"Minkow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1441922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8SiMjsqfXkAUQ4SKpdcBpbUCaA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
