The sheer uncertainty about the future pushes folks to cling on to their daily habits while trying to get along with the ever-shifting political landscape. A wide array of wildly diversified characters try to cope as good as they can with the hardships in their town. A death metal band keeps rehearsing daily. A teacher guides visitors through the story of the city. The wonders of a vibrating armchair are tested as a tool against stress and anxiety. An elderly lady who has lost her son tries to talk some sense into her fellow citizens urging them to accept peace.","popularity":0.3311,"poster_path":"/bR14hAnVp5DKUkCwP1im0NUKFpk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Долгое эхо","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Довге ехо","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Holger Buff","original_name":"Holger Buff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f7d0dca4f6700821189f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223923,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yana Höhnerbach","original_name":"Yana Höhnerbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f7d188138310077305bf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronika Glasunowa","original_name":"Veronika Glasunowa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fd3e0692514163f5026f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukasz Lakomy","original_name":"Lukasz Lakomy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fd3e1192514163f5026f77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6439530","wikidata_id":"Q87395163","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bR14hAnVp5DKUkCwP1im0NUKFpk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":252606,"name":"russian invasion of ukraine (2022)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Long Echo | Veronika Glasunowa, Lukasz Lakomy","key":"vSCAAH2dRPE","published_at":"2017-04-04T06:28:27.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a63a9c0c3a3687f75016d27"}]}}}
