He films the intimacy of his family, the moments shared in the house that saw him grow up, between the vines of the Valais region, in the hollow of the mountains. The Sunday reunions, around his father’s cooking, the summer days in the flowering garden, together… He films, as if his camera could still hold back his family, keep it solid and close-knit, when everything is crumbling faced with the perspective of death.","popularity":0.0922,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Journey","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Maye","original_name":"David Maye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fd3ce0925141642f02743d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
