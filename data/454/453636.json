Upon her return, she found her mother, father, and 12-year-old sister bound, gaged, shot, and stabbed in the back bedroom. That night marked an abrupt transition for the residents of Tallahassee, Florida: door locks were sold out, gun stores were emptied, and people no longer felt safe or trusting of their neighbors. To date, no charges have been pressed for the murder of Helen, Robert, and Joy Sims. The 50-year investigation has uncovered a series of interesting suspects, none of which have been formally cleared. This film covers all five, including a never-before-seen police interview with one suspect from 1987, and an interview with her ex-husband filmed in the summer of 2016.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":"/mymTS6ihUVEA5k7aIlzmnDeFOBe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film recounting the chilling unsolved triple-murder of the Sims family that has haunted Tallahassee, Florida since 1966.","title":"641 Muriel Court","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801699,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kyle Jones","original_name":"Kyle Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfb23c3a36879be017790","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elijah Howard","original_name":"Elijah Howard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfbfcc3a3687984017a86","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801699,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kyle Jones","original_name":"Kyle Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfb44c3a36879be0177bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801699,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kyle Jones","original_name":"Kyle Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfab6925141642f0173d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deanna Kidd","original_name":"Deanna Kidd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfbc292514163ec016e06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deanna Kidd","original_name":"Deanna Kidd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfaf9c3a3687a15015520","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elijah Howard","original_name":"Elijah Howard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfbe092514163e3017e72","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Walsh","original_name":"Michael Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfc3ac3a3687a2501693d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Walsh","original_name":"Michael Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fbfc5cc3a3687a15015699","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30228021","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6rc8Is5vfmG4IMsvw1tjPovihJl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2457,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mymTS6ihUVEA5k7aIlzmnDeFOBe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207046,"name":"murder mystery"},{"id":210662,"name":"cold case"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
