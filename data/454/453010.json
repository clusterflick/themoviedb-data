Disappointed because of her lack of money to buy the necessary medicine, she sees a notice in a discarded newspaper: ‘Ecological Action: wagons for old iron arrive in train station for recycling’. She comes up with a creative plan and goes to see Andrej, the local mafia boss who often visits Grandmother Fatima for fortunetelling. The superstitious boss orders his bodyguards to rob the train and deliver the iron to the old lady. Amazed by the ironic story, the police officers release Perhan and help to obtain the necessary medication for Fatima.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/whCYHthJzxoOKew0tKvLr5wiBcd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33715,"logo_path":null,"name":"fx3x","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":89106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Strymon Film","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Iron","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Старо железо","type":"Работен наслов"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Zheleznata prikazna","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Bošković","original_name":"Monika Bošković","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fati","credit_id":"58f796ee92514158060001ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bajram Severdžan","original_name":"Bajram Severdžan","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Perhan","credit_id":"58f796b8925141582e0001b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1029062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jelena Jovanova","original_name":"Jelena Jovanova","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/uEQmw3SauVGsg4bjNsVmxtpAwMo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nadire","credit_id":"58f7969ec3a3684ea1000185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katina Ivanova","original_name":"Katina Ivanova","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fatima","credit_id":"58f796c5c3a3684e700001b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Mihajlovski","original_name":"Toni Mihajlovski","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/rLgAMpy5SfYjefMx9CUHi6Nnb8L.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Petrov","credit_id":"63e6e61b6f43ec0079968827","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1526004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Predrag Pavlovski","original_name":"Predrag Pavlovski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Načalnik","credit_id":"58f796e3925141582e0001d4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dime Iliev","original_name":"Dime Iliev","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nikolaj","credit_id":"58f796d5925141582e0001c7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Spiroski","original_name":"Igor Spiroski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Andrej","credit_id":"58f796fd925141580a000217","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3915128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidija Čerepnalkovska","original_name":"Lidija Čerepnalkovska","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Doktorkata","credit_id":"63e6e6edbf09d100de10ea4f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zlatko Kalenikov","original_name":"Zlatko Kalenikov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7971e9251415822000233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zlatko Kalenikov","original_name":"Zlatko Kalenikov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f7972c925141582e000229","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531905,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dejan Dimeski","original_name":"Dejan Dimeski","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f797419251415822000268","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6921458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1497,"iso_639_1":"mk","file_path":"/whCYHthJzxoOKew0tKvLr5wiBcd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
