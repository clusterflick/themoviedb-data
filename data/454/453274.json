Present day. Giovanna, a combative 60-year-old social worker on the frontline of the daily war against pervasive criminality, is confronted, like a modern Antigone, with a moral dilemma that threatens to destroy her work and her life. Giovanna runs an after-school centre that takes care of underprivileged children; a grassroots alternative to the mafia dominance of the city. But one day, young Maria, wife of a ruthless Camorra criminal on the run, and her two children take refuge at the centre, and ask Giovanna for protection.","popularity":0.3174,"poster_path":"/hTXDYPYX1j9rP1ElUn0nL1BVF5F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76129,"logo_path":"/wadqq2xlU1fWkRT2BSOb2VDyDVZ.png","name":"Tempesta","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":2715,"logo_path":"/hEojI1NMV4UH9j09J4HDnFDCwUB.png","name":"Amka
