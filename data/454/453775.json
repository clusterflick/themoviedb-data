The story takes place in the Nineties years, when Macedonia was at a crossroads in its independence and forming their own way. Period of transition and proof… The story takes place in the capital of its margin, in a small stubburn. The main character is a picture of alienation and a photo forgotten and disbanded youth. Youth - no idea and direction, no time in which it could be priced.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/yD0G8qwgF5sGDmHLVE14LbGGEwh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Circle Production","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2011-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Violent Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Синот на сатаната","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikola Kolev","original_name":"Nikola Kolev","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Filip","credit_id":"58fcce1e92514163e3023b05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1544689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivo Antov Larsson","original_name":"Ivo Antov Larsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pepo","credit_id":"58fcce24c3a368798402320e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Simonov","original_name":"Jordan Simonov","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/yn1Aq4KONusu3tntgCWPnjpKNBR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Father","credit_id":"58fcce39c3a36879f401f5ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petar Kostadinovski","original_name":"Petar Kostadinovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marko","credit_id":"5bc2c4f20e0a266e57042271","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Ristevski","original_name":"Marko Ristevski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Darko","credit_id":"5bc2c50e0e0a266e6404097a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Bukowski","original_name":"Charles Bukowski","popularity":0.2255,"profile_path":"/jHKXGjR60oYp5k0hNiU10VNQg6P.jpg","credit_id":"58fcce0d92514163e3023af8","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marko Gjokovik","original_name":"Marko Gjokovik","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fccde792514163ec0225b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marko Gjokovik","original_name":"Marko Gjokovik","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fedbb2de04aca003d181461","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1901035","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":756,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yD0G8qwgF5sGDmHLVE14LbGGEwh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Violent Youth - trailer","key":"bA8y5RAT-e0","published_at":"2010-07-21T17:18:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58fccd22c3a3687984023118"}]}}}
