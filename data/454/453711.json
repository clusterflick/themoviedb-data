A fine gesture, simultaneously generous and modest, which is successful in approaching and translating an intangible matter; that which even sometimes manifests itself in the mere obviousness of its existence. Although feelings cannot be represented, they may at least be invoked, such as the figure of the synecdoche—one part to skim over everything, in this specific case. The image on film holds itself at a distance from the sound and exacerbates a feeling of in-betweenness: time passes, impressions fade, while relationships are built, imperceptibly.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hypertable – Essay on Friendship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Filliger","original_name":"Filippo Filliger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fc89a5925141643c01f8f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
