Most of those appearing in this documentary filmed in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, France, Germany and Croatia have personal experience of the indifference to the genocide of the Roma. Many of them experienced the Holocaust as children, and their distorted memories have earned them distrust and ridicule. Continuing racism and anti-Roma sentiment is illustrated among other matters by how contemporary society looks after the locations where the murders occurred. However, this documentary film essay focuses mainly on the survivors, who share with viewers their indelible traumas, their \"hole in the head\".","popularity":0.3867,"poster_path":"/61gHzU3xxJYVm4hUo5q6e7mjv2h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hitchhiker
