Written by Tony Award-winning composer Jason Robert Brown, the play is now produced in an entirely new and innovative way. It is the musicalâ€™s unconventional structure that is allowing this brand-new, highly innovative form of streamed theatre to be created. Jamie tells his story chronologically from their love-at-first-site meeting, whilst Cath tells her story in reverse, from the end of their turbulent relationship to the start. This means the two characters do not directly interact except for one song in the middle of the show when their timelines intersect.","popularity":0.1321,"poster_path":"/mP7sAo3O8vDACP1d6sqxgwz4fpk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136402,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Other Palace","origin_country":""},{"id":136403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lambert Jackson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Five Years","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Samuels","original_name":"Lauren Samuels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cathy","credit_id":"5ef7bbcbbe7f3500329eaf08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Becker","original_name":"Danny Becker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jamie","credit_id":"5ef7bbd4e93e950035b6d3f0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540077,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Robert Brown","original_name":"Jason Robert Brown","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/hEu04PPigVz4ejzzOUTzINn9jpg.jpg","credit_id":"644a3424b1131f05471a6df7","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540077,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Robert Brown","original_name":"Jason Robert Brown","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/hEu04PPigVz4ejzzOUTzINn9jpg.jpg","credit_id":"5ef7bbeba284eb00378ca9db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Samuels","original_name":"Lauren Samuels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef7bc0fe93e950032b5c3d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694050,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joshua Winstone","original_name":"Joshua Winstone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef7bc21e93e950034b4e45f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694052,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danny Kaan","original_name":"Danny Kaan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef7bc2ba284eb00388d62a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mP7sAo3O8vDACP1d6sqxgwz4fpk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
