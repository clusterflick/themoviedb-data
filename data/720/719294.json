Her female intuition intuiting that there's more to this than meets the eye, she pushes George to tell her what's really bugging him. George, on the other hand, wants whatever this is to end, like right now. He decides to take a walk, Melany blocks his path; one thing leads to another and the gloves come off: it's a full-on fistfight that ends tragically when George, in a fit of rage, strangles Melany to death. The following morning finds George passed out on the living room floor. He wakes up and the memories of the events from the night before wash over him, except...well, who knows if that's what really happened.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/nVE4551pXIjVv74EDrJKaGlX9Im.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sela Films","origin_country":""},{"id":131400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fourwind Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Letting go is just a battlefield away.","title":"Hermit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Marie Freeman","original_name":"Kimberly Marie Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cynthia","credit_id":"5ef65e7427d9cc0037ac7175","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lukas Hassel","original_name":"Lukas Hassel","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/wgZiPpYqDXoyfLfloejp6nwZMoE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"George","credit_id":"5ef65e8951e6ab00352bfb0c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lizinke Kruger","original_name":"Lizinke Kruger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Melany","credit_id":"5ef65e98c7176d0036a3d97f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799470,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aimiende Negbenebor Sela","original_name":"Aimiende Negbenebor Sela","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef65eb0e93e950033b47bc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2442526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricky Rosario","original_name":"Ricky Rosario","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":"/9wtAdsjYwH1qtO4MedC8FSbhMln.jpg","credit_id":"5ef65ebe13af5f00365122ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799470,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aimiende Negbenebor Sela","original_name":"Aimiende Negbenebor Sela","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022b19495c0af003f5175bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11027932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVE4551pXIjVv74EDrJKaGlX9Im.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
