Over the course of one tumultuous season, Bertha, her partner and her chicks battle fearsome predators and formidable rains, but also play an invaluable role in sustaining life in this ecological hotspot. Dino Bird is an intimate and rarely seen portrait of one of Australia's last remaining southern cassowaries.","popularity":0.2333,"poster_path":"/yYXJ62BqB39sNHEL8OQA7WKd7UZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75207,"logo_path":"/5HMd3ADYzBGuvLFuRycSIWDpJFf.png","name":"WildBear Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dino Bird","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Lanz","original_name":"Christian Lanz","popularity":0.2997,"profile_path":"/4GDmhCJvdOQHV0uRuK34XJBMiTr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ef7637ee93e950034b49c55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167181,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edward Saltau","original_name":"Edward Saltau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef763befa40460034063ab7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8301850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/emFbaU4soZZPyGuqpXn16WiXwgn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jciMnrKLBi9LA8I2F2HGQrFTm72.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":6.873,"height":157,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kVwKSK1QuJYDPRPKKPy7hO8W5FR.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1079}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yYXJ62BqB39sNHEL8OQA7WKd7UZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1001,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yLvkqM1z4T6NhHeoqvSVXarqHqx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AdvnNUjIEaQQTsQpurmZMpSmglW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lEDv7QlnCXsmXeLBU5wBr9pD66Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Nat Geo WILD","release_date":"2018-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
