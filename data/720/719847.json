The clash between Dionysus, played as a modern-day rock star, and his cousin Pentheus, the uncompromising and moralistic king of the city, examines the consequences of a general public that blindly follows two vastly different leaders. Dionysus represents unbridled freedom and excess while on the other end of the spectrum, Pentheus epitomizes excessive law, order and rigidity. As society slides into fear and tribalism, its citizens' rationale becomes clouded as they blindly take orders and pick sides rather than seek moderation and rationality.","popularity":0.2639,"poster_path":"/dvaXfTjWk4lZEzphfKBOrx5ogEf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classical Theatre of Harlem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bacchae","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason C.
