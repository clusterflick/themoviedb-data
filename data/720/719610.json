Like Oedipus himself, however, they discover that eluding destiny is no mean feat.  Spymonkeyâ€™s hilariously inspired physical comedy combines with the playful storytelling verve of Kneehigh artistic director Emma Rice and writing partner Carl Grose to create an outrageous no-holds-barred subversion of the quintessential Greek tragedy. Inspired by Barbarella and a little bit of Bond, this is a tale of the ultimate dysfunctional family: a jealous father, a messed-up son, and one mother of a brilliant comedy.
