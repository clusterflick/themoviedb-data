By contrasting the creative paths of these artists, and a connection between them by the world renowned Kronos Quartet, the film explores music not as a form of entertainment, career, or even self-expression, but as a tool to develop more deeply meaningful relationships with people and the complexities of the world they live in.","popularity":0.0788,"poster_path":"/oj9gn2Of4FZAwibNY0fSixRQmOi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Candela Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reach of Resonance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Luther Adams","original_name":"John Luther Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f667a2f5a78840034c04c9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Rose","original_name":"Jon Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f667ae1a0b69000383b8c3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Vatiliotis","original_name":"Harry Vatiliotis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f667bb908cf87003a492c6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miya Masaoka","original_name":"Miya Masaoka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f667cb46a222700378df5eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f667f9084448e003969edde","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292746,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Ostertag","original_name":"Bob Ostertag","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/spm34iHDOlrwDAuxzDZKHUA121S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f66804e1684f7003957e4d2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Lummerzheim","original_name":"Dirk Lummerzheim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f66898b1b1f3c0037a6bea8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brazina Boston","original_name":"Brazina Boston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f668baa5c564e003660d711","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Elkins","original_name":"Steve Elkins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f667a9e6a222700378dead9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1740042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oj9gn2Of4FZAwibNY0fSixRQmOi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"estival International Du Film Sur L'Art, Montréal","release_date":"2011-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Worldwide availability","release_date":"2013-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
