The COI would go on to sponsor thousands of films, long and short, over the next 65 years. Made by the government’s Crown Film Unit, which had turned out brilliant propaganda during the war, The Railwaymen isn’t one of the unit’s best films. But it is enjoyable and interesting, and one of a significant series encouraging recruitment to various industries in the postwar reconstruction effort.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pyV7XHyouFy7PFfxrLdzdsELkfy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown Film Unit","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This government–sponsored film promoted recruitment to the postwar railways, at a time when young boys still dreamed of driving a train.","title":"The Railwaymen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602785,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Q.
