They arrive at an empty apartment on the 26th floor  surrounded by skyscrapers and highways. Aleque and Issay sleep on inflatable beds  and long for their toys. Day by day, they start learning new things, they try local foods  and pick up simple Chinese words. Aleque & Issay is a film told from a child’s  perspective, narrated by the youngest sister. With a low camera angle, we get to follow  their growth journey, transitioning from toddlers to school-aged children.","popularity":0.1769,"poster_path":"/7rtyVTZwX0FufMeHg2tNqUEpQBq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neo Publishing
