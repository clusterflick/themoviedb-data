In his child’s home, he confronts his identities: Joana, the composed one, refuses to let him go; Millie, a terrified child, recoils from him; and Lucas, aggressive and mocking, reveals dark truths. As sirens approach, Henry flees to the basement, only to find his true self Alex chained, battered, and screaming about their crimes. Flashbacks of murder flood Henry’s mind. As he tries to escape, Alex slits his wrists, calling Henry’s name. Overcome with dread, they die together, trapped by their fractured, inescapable past.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wFJcuS4OlCMviiWKjuPdjMe0AXw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255369,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shera Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"atonement lurks in the shadow of your mind","title":"Let Me Go","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Colbourne","original_name":"Benjamin Colbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"67c85777830570d1fdc2a4b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Colbourne","original_name":"Benjamin Colbourne","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Lucas","credit_id":"67ca45dcf708440336cb4c5a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Colbourne","original_name":"Benjamin Colbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"67ca45e7aa523c748a2b3db1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Colbourne","original_name":"Benjamin Colbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Millie","credit_id":"67ca45f2dba14916062b3caa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Colbourne","original_name":"Benjamin Colbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Joanna","credit_id":"67ca45fe8f0e59863bafbe33","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Carr","original_name":"Amy Carr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85a81830570d1fdc2a549","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Carr","original_name":"Amy Carr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85a8e8fca0c0b03e7022b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905582,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sarhang Shera Sinjawe","original_name":"Sarhang Shera Sinjawe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85a9a821c19b5ebe6ff68","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284637,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Dylon Wagon","original_name":"Dylon Wagon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85ac13de30421b7c2a306","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Special Effects Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284639,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thomas Elliot","original_name":"Thomas Elliot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85ae29264aa58666e4339","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284640,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bethannie Wood","original_name":"Bethannie Wood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85af6d7419cdfd86e3825","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284641,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"charley wood","original_name":"charley wood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c85b10d7419cdfd86e383d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqnvE43sgLRjd4TCGZHqTf8Ln7S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1158,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wFJcuS4OlCMviiWKjuPdjMe0AXw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":868}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Let Me Go Promo - GoFundMe","key":"03ejTfEPth0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-09T19:29:39.000Z","id":"67ca459936598226a1afc518"}]}}}
