They are based in a large mansion house in the country, just outside Edenton village. They like to present an air of exclusivity and respectability, but their controversial training methods have brought them unwanted attention. Accusations abound that they have been employing abusive training techniques.  As Jenks investigates he discovers further information linking Atlas to previous suicides and witnesses some of their bizarre training exercises.  Then when he meets a disturbed former student things begin to look even darker. Atlas training techniques appear to be causing real psychological damage.  Jenks gradually reveals occult practices, psychological manipulation and physical abuse, all behind the mask of a legitimate business training course.","popularity":0.2757,"poster_path":"/hiLWtQhrwwQ2vO4Nhr61FLXZvJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baggy Cat
