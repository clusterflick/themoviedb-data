Stunningly filmed, visually captivating, and quite evocative, Kick-Off demonstrates how athletics has the power to break taboos, opposing the norms of traditionalism, while promoting gender quality in rigidly patriarchal societies, where women are left with no choice but to occupy the margins of solely inflexible, highly restrictive roles. Sports and play, being the most natural expression of human joy - unbound by limitations and uncontained, are the best response to the sullen \"no's\" imposed by any form of oppression.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moving Mountains Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kick-Off","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Στη σέντρα","type":"Greek title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1821145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roser Corella","original_name":"Roser Corella","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7d03e73b7f95da9c29315","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1821145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roser Corella","original_name":"Roser Corella","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7d04290355c64576e45fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Obino","original_name":"Stefano Obino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7d05b90355c64576e4608","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Obino","original_name":"Stefano Obino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7d05f73b7f95da9c29331","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Obino","original_name":"Stefano Obino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7d2ad395b736565e6f07f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5283971,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefano Tucci","original_name":"Stefano Tucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7d2bd73b7f95da9c29411","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pOwKAgR4CtKYA2fML0nKqdJCbRk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1334}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"27th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival ","release_date":"2025-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
