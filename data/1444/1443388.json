Her painting process involved waiting for images to appear in her mind as small squares and then making long-hand calculations to upscale them exactly to the size of her 6x6 foot canvases.  Critics often suggested her work was about landscape but she insisted it was not. This impressionistic psycho-biography colludes landscape and mindscape, playing with the materiality of analog and digital video to evoke a felt-sense of Martinâ€™s life and work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/plKUabrTsvhCr2tiuliopovxgNi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinhin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lydia Moyer","original_name":"Lydia Moyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c7e6c09264aa58666e27c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/plKUabrTsvhCr2tiuliopovxgNi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
