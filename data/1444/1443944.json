In his efforts to secure a desirable wife he has inserted some advertisements in the newspapers. So we find him going through hundreds of letters as he thrusts aside disdainfully the greater number of photographs accompanying the answers. One letter finally finds favor in his eyes; the writing is excellent, the phrasing is pleasing and the photograph which he extracts from the envelope shows to him the likeness of a young girl, pretty, smiling, lovely, in every way ideal for a life’s companion. But while he dreams with half-open eyes of the joys in store for him, old Truth comes out of a well in the middle of the room, and she presents to him a mirror in which he may see reality.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1904-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wedding by Correspondence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"67c99c446fb40013920cf023","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228564","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1904-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
