Set in a folklore universe in southern Spain, the movie takes inspiration from the work of the Spanish painter Julio Romero de Torres and the song Andalucia La Que Divierte by the 70s singer Pepe Suero. Against a backdrop of the candlelit flamenco dancerâ€™s dressing room, adult performers Maria Riot and Tommy Cabrio meet for a sensual and erotic rendezvous.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ePTxVhl5hWHnvcQNOqWm7vRrhmv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cane Honey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ePTxVhl5hWHnvcQNOqWm7vRrhmv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
