Aside from a screening as part of Anthology’s tribute to the Group in 2012, it has rarely been seen since. A tale of smuggling and survivalists that adopts the tone and visual style of film noir, but with a narrative logic all its own, it stars Willem Dafoe as Jack Straw, a small-time operator who ran a “pharmaceutical outfit” before an accident changed everything. A rare instance of an extended moving-image work by the Wooster Group that was created independently of their theatrical productions, WRONG GUYS is a fascinating and little-seen work. — Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.158,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrong Guys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willem Dafoe","original_name":"Willem Dafoe","popularity":4.0987,"profile_path":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jack Straw","credit_id":"67a40aabaca91da4ba85a743","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth LeCompte","original_name":"Elizabeth LeCompte","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/m81g4Lv5EIuDtSMLBIPSecdA5YN.jpg","credit_id":"67a409985088b945972fc154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5228281,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ken Kobland","original_name":"Ken Kobland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a409a65088b945972fc16f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Kondek","original_name":"Christopher Kondek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a409ccf196a73ae766c8c3","department":"Camera","job":"Videojournalist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lurie","original_name":"John Lurie","popularity":0.3216,"profile_path":"/ocxaaEEcdtKgQTIkkN55L7K1YGh.jpg","credit_id":"67a409ddf196a73ae766c8db","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
