For many, the system is a nightmare—filled with trauma no child should endure. Protecting younger siblings became a mission then, and now that mission continues through this deeply personal documentary. It sheds light on the abuse countless children still face, not because they are the problem but because their environment has failed them. Yet, amidst the pain, there is hope. Through archival footage and interviews, Unbroken Ties explores resilience, chosen families, and the transformative power of love beyond blood.","popularity":0.1023,"poster_path":"/6bV3VzryoPXJXBDluiHIRLS0a7Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hello, Camera
