Sold to a used bookstore, the book passes through the hands of The Patron, The Hustler, and The Broken—each navigating their own struggles. As their lives intersect, a red Victrola, a café, and a fleeting exchange spark moments of pain, creativity, and transformation. Through these chance connections, they discover that even the smallest encounters can alter life’s course.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunspots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2630376,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastian Galasso","original_name":"Sebastian Galasso","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herman / The Hustler","credit_id":"67a29359be3459d482810781","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Aizer","original_name":"Ariel Aizer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Storekeeper","credit_id":"67a2938be17dd4fbd8810058","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Schwab","original_name":"Jerome Schwab","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Broken","credit_id":"67a293f1e17dd4fbd88100aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Parriott","original_name":"Olivia Parriott","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Lover","credit_id":"67a2941028a1076d089fc2b9","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2346518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina D'Elia","original_name":"Tina D'Elia","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/qEnU35FLeBdrc1CbBfk8SOfOVRY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Patron","credit_id":"67a29425dc24ee93d181033e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura May","original_name":"Laura May","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Art Dealer","credit_id":"67a29452e17dd4fbd88100f5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Korda","original_name":"Sarah Korda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Bereft","credit_id":"67a29473a8b6fce55d8a648e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Breaux","original_name":"Maria Breaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a292cfbeb17c876a9fc3dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Breaux","original_name":"Maria Breaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a292ddbeb17c876a9fc3f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Breaux","original_name":"Maria Breaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a292ebee3932a6729fc59a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3601309,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jody Stillwater","original_name":"Jody Stillwater","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vBLtR47AfAKfZCzQv5e8WV3ChNK.jpg","credit_id":"67a2930bee3932a6729fc5b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1365039","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
