Dr. Anthony Fauci, then director of the NIAID (the AIDS arm of the NIH), watches as the activists march around his building, demanding inclusion in his clinical research committees. Meanwhile, a young gay filmmaker captures the events of the protest while attempting to deliver a package to Fauci. As the demonstrations threaten to upend the scientists' work, both men are forced to reckon with the meaning of power and responsibility.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/eLIKgfaMiByMhnUxCuK0NHEqCse.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We die they do nothing!","title":"Silence = Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Kellogg-Darrin","original_name":"Christine Kellogg-Darrin","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/8I9UawqSRfdsj9OntIPJhO1bOdU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67a2c460bd99d6e9a581109c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1729136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Destiny Faith Nelson","original_name":"Destiny Faith Nelson","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/yHl8TmGf3ug5bG46KxzgFKdHWzT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67a2c481beb17c876a9fcc12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Garcia","original_name":"Julian Garcia","popularity":0.1202,"profile_path":"/hXET11An7m21s3frmqMmDKx7aXG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67a2c4b4f0842f32da8a6aa6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4466940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane Campayne","original_name":"Shane Campayne","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67a2c4c6dc24ee93d1810777","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.G.
