In their campaigns they deal with what moves the rural population. People who are difficult to grasp in the media and in opinion polls and who feel increasingly ignored - their needs and worries are unheard of. This outrageous story is told from the perspective of the director Jean Boué. He has lived in Prignitz, the most sparsely populated district in Germany, for twelve years. He knows the local conditions and tries to find out why rural areas seem to be increasingly less accessible with urban-controlled politics.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/iBIMD8VlkcExWQpZcSmuzpruEbj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Grimme price","title":"The Unheard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Boué","original_name":"Jean Boué","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67a32750a8b6fce55d8a770d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Boué","original_name":"Jean Boué","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a325b1ee3932a6729fd81e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Boué","original_name":"Jean Boué","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a325d9e17dd4fbd8810e99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50864,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Knut Schmitz","original_name":"Knut Schmitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a32601beb17c876a9fd286","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":893,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/iBIMD8VlkcExWQpZcSmuzpruEbj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Film ohne Grenzen","release_date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
