The Yangtze River, Buddhism, new cities, mysterious ways, ancient cities... and people's thoughts are spreading wantonly. The five elements are interdependent and eternal, and the five elements are mutually restrained and changeable. High buildings rise, and the mountains are gone in the distance. No matter where people are, they cannot escape the arrangement of fate. The happiness and pain of the past, the forgotten and the deep, will eventually become the past and dissipate in the wind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rTKyKsqpWKGLp9lPLQYlfAfCh1R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"永恒与漂变 Eternity and drift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rTKyKsqpWKGLp9lPLQYlfAfCh1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":896}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
