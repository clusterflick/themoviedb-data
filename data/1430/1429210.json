Centered on resistance and collective care among communities, this inaugural documentary produced by the Oral History Lab at UPRM and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities showcases how community work by projects like Aula en la Montaña and organizations like Impacto Juventud GC Inc. demonstrate that strength lies in union and that true healing occurs through mutual accompaniment between community and volunteers.","popularity":0.3921,"poster_path":"/7wdzvDU3unalum1MsYKn54eWXrq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of collective care and resistance","title":"Todavía Estamos Aquí","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge André Santiago Fernández","original_name":"Jorge André Santiago Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9OSL5MfZ7DjptGERKbzwzxbOsx0.jpg","credit_id":"67a2c77273542082b69fc2fa","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4544819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Carolina","original_name":"Andrea Carolina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a2c7822588c0d32b8a6a51","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226423,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carhianie J.
