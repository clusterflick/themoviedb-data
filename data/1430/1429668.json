Cape Bretoner Flora MacDonald is campaigning for the Party’s leadership, the first woman to do so. We follow MacDonald behind the scenes as she works with her staff to prepare policy, speeches, and strategies to win the race. We also get a glimpse of MacDonald’s sprightly and upbeat attitude as she puts her best foot forward in front of voters, media, and the Party’s elite.","popularity":0.1484,"poster_path":"/8OgeoDwrPaTjh3uC1jBeGNpi7PD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flora: Scenes from a Leadership Convention","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a3d76aea49de7ac02fb7c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a3d7d143781b4bfa2fb9d8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448132,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael McKennirey","original_name":"Michael McKennirey","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a3d7f3aca91da4ba859caa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143189,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Hammond","original_name":"Arthur Hammond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a3d82fc1e5ed8bfc859f49","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":356422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roman Kroitor","original_name":"Roman Kroitor","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/UXB1hDtpvCaGUrf1PJ01IfZ7N7.jpg","credit_id":"67a3d8558dbb4c099066ca56","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4ac9d77b8ced45666e541","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Kiefer","original_name":"Douglas Kiefer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4acfe2f44f82ad32feea2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451576,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David De Volpi","original_name":"David De Volpi","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4ad24d47bc77cb885b5dd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152507,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Drouin","original_name":"Jacques Drouin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4ad3a77b8ced45666e5a1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499546,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bev Davidson","original_name":"Bev Davidson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4ad4977b8ced45666e5a4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727741,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Les Halman","original_name":"Les Halman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4ad58ea49de7ac02fd3a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4ad904501b2f23366e241","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OgeoDwrPaTjh3uC1jBeGNpi7PD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1977-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
