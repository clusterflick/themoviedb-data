Nowadays, he works in a small film as an office clerk and reminisces about his days of shooting films when he was about to graduate. One day a palm-reader directed him to a railway; he goes there and has a strange dream which he doesn’t know if it’s real or not. At this moment, it occurs to him that this dream can be dramatized into a new script. However, during the next period of life where he works and writes the script, he cannot distinguish reality and illusions, and he doesn’t know whether he is really ill or his body is just objectively reacting to the surreal world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gg8Y9E5122RvhUupv5kf4Sclgld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"隔间里的摩尔甫斯 Morpheus in the Cubicle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1335,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gg8Y9E5122RvhUupv5kf4Sclgld.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":934}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
