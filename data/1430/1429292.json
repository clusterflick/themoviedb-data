However, in their adopted home country, they have run into street violence. By telling the story of these brothers the film asks if it is possible to break the cycle of violence through one’s own actions and to live without constantly having to look over one’s shoulder? The film’s aesthetic choices are bold and alienate the viewer from the violence of the subject to just the right degree.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmi Tenkula","original_name":"Emmi Tenkula","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a31c210d5b4b980a9fd0e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
