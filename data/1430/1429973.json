For the first time, 35mm color footage of the war in France in 1940, unknown images from the Norway campaign and impressive scenes from the advance in the Soviet Union in 1941/42 are shown here. The whole madness of the Second World War comes frighteningly close with these color recordings, in a way that is hardly possible from the stories of those involved at the time.","popularity":0.1285,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6298,"logo_path":"/2pBvKkc9QlFaopszammMmffGWTT.png","name":"Spiegel TV","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Second World War in Color","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Zweite Weltkrieg in Farbe","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Third Reich in Color - World War II","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Krieg in Farbe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Powell","original_name":"Robert Powell","popularity":2.0137,"profile_path":"/seHIncPS18PLjhEPqy4ZdeZ6lsU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67a4a7335088b945972fce2f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kloft","original_name":"Michael Kloft","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/4XqmLKkL32mNE0Iq60jSZ1p4YM3.jpg","credit_id":"67a4a74dc1e5ed8bfc85b5ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
