La experiencia de Armando Rojas Guardia","overview":"This documentary takes us on a sensorial and atmospheric journey through the experiences, words and thoughts of the Venezuelan essayist and poet Armando Rojas Guardia. His early connection with the divine, the gradual inner maturation of a mystical experience that he manages to glimpse in his early adulthood, the determining and complex influence of his father (also a writer), his first crush on a young high school classmate, the profound experience of homoeroticism, the abysses of the psychotic crisis. All experiences pushed to the limit and which make up some of the singular elements of a unique artistic and intellectual quest with a broad universal scope.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/zScuOK68C4CdICKakVdjm7AcS8E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Austères","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2023-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intemperie.
