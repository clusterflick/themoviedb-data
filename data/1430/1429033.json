The capital, which had flourished and buzzed with culture at the turn of the century, was levelled in an instant by the Second World War. The people living here had to start from scratch, and through perseverance and determination, the city once again began to thrive—only to slide toward decline once more. Budapest exists within this cycle, and the ruin pub is part of it, encapsulating a sense of permanence built from the ruins of Eastern Europe.","popularity":0.3218,"poster_path":"/e2dBpLipZXZP7PmfNKLfSwjbxfp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30272,"logo_path":null,"name":"JumpCut","origin_country":""},{"id":252450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brightside","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romokból","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1259966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bori
