Getting chemo treatments every two weeks, he is unable to travel, so he does the next best thing: he makes his own Camino in his backyard, walking the perimeter of his property through woods and pasture, and sets out to walk his way across Spain without ever leaving home. The simple act of walking, both in his backyard and eventually on the trail in Spain, reveals the key to his physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, and he realizes his greatest pilgrimage is the one he travels within.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y2W8DFkvPOKiKv4YlQrst9lw8OR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phil's Camino: So Far, So Good","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5226473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie O'Neil","original_name":"Annie O'Neil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a2ccc30d5b4b980a9fc75e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8065146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2W8DFkvPOKiKv4YlQrst9lw8OR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Phil's Camino - Trailer","key":"9sgNsUmjEow","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-29T19:40:11.000Z","id":"67a2cd7a0d5b4b980a9fc79e"}]}}}
