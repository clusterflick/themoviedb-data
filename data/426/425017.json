Gundy had owned the parkland as a family estate, and upon his death in 1951, donated the land to the city in memory of his wife. In early spring, the trees remain bare from winter, on cusp of renewal. The film takes her name for its homophonic relation to the nursery rhyme Solomon Grundy (born on a Monday, christened on Tuesday, married on Wednesday...), which cycles through the days of the week that chart Grundy's life from birth to death, inevitably repeating, birth and death enclosed in a loop.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serena Gundy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Broomer","original_name":"Stephen Broomer","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/5nu90x21hsMMeH2NQvS2dmfa96r.jpg","credit_id":"58212c349251413cce0008e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10577766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
