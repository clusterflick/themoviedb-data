In this film we get a 4 year snapshot of the everyday existence of the man behind the lyrical concept of not only his own solo releases, but also Yvonne and Strip Music. While the medical treatments of CF have developed rapidly in the later decades one must keep in mind that when the very young de la Cour got his diagnosis the expected lifetime with this disease was approximately 15 years. Frössén presents an everyday life where this approximation continuously gets prolonged until finally, at the age of 40, Henric de la Cour is presented with some miracle cure that is to wipe the premature death sentence away altogether.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":"/hkeIXwXJG4DtL34Okda8XI2wmPc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henric de la Cour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henric de la Cour","original_name":"Henric de la Cour","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8tpd4zV13KTiPUGgVQVtT8Jy7pg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5d9a2b7881a7fc0020c547e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Frössén","original_name":"Jacob Frössén","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58272a32c3a3683608018d5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s2uKiB4uBNc8q06iSyrMr42Jjpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.739,"height":1310,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hkeIXwXJG4DtL34Okda8XI2wmPc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":968}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
