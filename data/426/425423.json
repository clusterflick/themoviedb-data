Sometimes one hears the rhythmic, pulsing symphony of crickets in a Baltimore summer night. Other times jangling toys dissolve into the roar of a jet overhead, or children tremble at the sound of thunder. These disparate sounds dislocate the space temporally and physically from the restrictions of reality. The small home-movie boxes within the larger screen are gestural forms of memory, clues to childhood, mnemonic devices that expand on the sense of immediacy in her “drama.” These miniature image-objects represent snippets of an even earlier media technology: film. In contrast to the real time video image, they feel fleeting, ephemeral, imprecise.","popularity":0.0583,"poster_path":"/i65Jrp7npmP6FPi7tsC7oY2iOUd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Window Work","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c88fc87c3a36864690b5e3c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"5824a1879251416251003549","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6216850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i65Jrp7npmP6FPi7tsC7oY2iOUd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tate","release_date":"2000-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
