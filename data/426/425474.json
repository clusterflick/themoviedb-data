The film combines \"live action\" footage and in-camera double exposures. This footage is then further layered by superimposing and bi-packing the camera footage with handmade and hand-painted film frames created from plants and flowers gleaned in Riverside Park. The ambient sounds come from both Riverside Park and the filmmakerâ€™s childhood home in northeastern Missouri.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Side, Riverside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caryn Cline","original_name":"Caryn Cline","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5824c5559251416d180017b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
