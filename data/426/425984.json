He refuses to pay his tab of a million dollars to the criminal casino. He is soon shocked to discover Vivian, his bratty, tennis-playing teen daughter has been kidnapped by a smooth-of-skill but slight-of-bod professional, criminal-for-hire Caroline Horner. Alfred suddenly realizes how much his neglected daughter now means to him and makes a typically shrewd decision attesting to his ability to amass millions, and readily agrees to fork over an amount five times his original debt.","popularity":0.1981,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lethal combination","title":"Miami Shakedown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Michael Thomas","original_name":"Philip Michael Thomas","popularity":0.4235,"profile_path":"/rrDuyqoclQRazUTFpTMz2tY9k0o.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Frank Ferguson","credit_id":"5829c4c6c3a368360f03a7a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anabel Garcia","original_name":"Anabel Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Caroline Horner","credit_id":"5829c4e4c3a368360603ace4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Roth","original_name":"Steve Roth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alfred Stein","credit_id":"5829c5009251417b18039071","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loli Rainey","original_name":"Loli Rainey","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vivian Stein (the daughter)","credit_id":"5829c52ec3a368360103462b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Therese Marie","original_name":"Therese Marie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vivi Stein","credit_id":"5829c55dc3a368038102cdf9","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125931","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
