She believes that fear, ignorance, and pink-ribbon culture are fueling an explosive rate of unnecessary mastectomies in America. Blending medical archival footage with extensive 'collateral damage' suffered by our four women - repeated loss of implants, blood infections caused by multiple surgical procedures, cosmetic nipple exchanges, reactions to cadaver's skin that is used to house breast implants - we learn that breast reconstruction post-mastectomy is no 'boob job.' As Dr. Schnaper advocates breast conservation and debunks breast cancer myths, so the myth of St. Agatha, the Sicilian martyred saint of the breast, offers a commentary on our own confused contemporary moment.","popularity":0.0942,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Good Breast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","original_name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58278e34c3a368360401f306","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4199552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
