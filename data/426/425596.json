This documentary tries, and mostly manages, to balance the picture by capturing private solo improv sessions, both indoors and outdoors, that display Reijseger's mastery over different colors and tones - with the same astounding technique and soulful commitment. Interspersed with beautiful country- and city-side footage that evokes his ever contemplative music, Do You Still? also features intimate and sometimes bitter-sweet statements by Reijseger on his early years, \"career\" choices, mannerisms, anxieties and shortcomings.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banlieues Bleues","origin_country":""},{"id":10767,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Huit Production","origin_country":""},{"id":25564,"logo_path":"/hOMyGLs7mSWoDzVkGDYgK0BdVo6.png","name":"Mezzo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Still?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54902,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernst Reijseger","original_name":"Ernst Reijseger","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/2G9WjjNbjTv3XkYmduUhIAN8zQJ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself / Cello","credit_id":"58265b679251417b23010183","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larissa Groenveld","original_name":"Larissa Groenveld","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself / Cello","credit_id":"58265bd1c3a3683604010979","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Van De Laar","original_name":"Frank Van De Laar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Piano","credit_id":"58265bdcc3a368360b010e02","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351817,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Goldstein","original_name":"Jacques Goldstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265bfdc3a36836040109b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Coutant","original_name":"Philippe Coutant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265c28c3a3683604010a16","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18530,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laurent Chalet","original_name":"Laurent Chalet","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/7SMGJM9Ktgd1hjfsNV7oQ6pLHh4.jpg","credit_id":"58265c4e9251417b1d010153","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Coutant","original_name":"Philippe Coutant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265c58c3a3680381009b90","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707163,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Geoffroy Duval","original_name":"Geoffroy Duval","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265c649251417b210104d8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351817,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Goldstein","original_name":"Jacques Goldstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265c6d9251417b2901071b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707164,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrien Troussel","original_name":"Adrien Troussel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265c75c3a368360b010ee3","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351817,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Goldstein","original_name":"Jacques Goldstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265c899251417b1a010860","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Marc Schick","original_name":"Jean-Marc Schick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58265ca6c3a3683614010125","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
