Only the lamplighter did not sleep - he lit up the city. A little owlet helped him light the lanterns - all the same, owls do not sleep at night. And in the morning, the main person in the city - the mayor - made sure that the lamplighter put out all the lights on time - after all, it was already light during the day.
