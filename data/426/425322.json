Exposed as a scientific fallacy, ether was banished from scientific research at the same time that the substance and its properties was discovered by the artistic avantgarde. The artist research film explores the traces of nothingness and ether, from Michelson’s experimentum crucis to the recent discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Survey on Nothingness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Keller","original_name":"Christoph Keller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58242252c3a3684bf7005a93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
