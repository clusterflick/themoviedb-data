In 1938 Lenard, a writer with a Jewish background, fled the Nazis to a safe haven in Rome. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Army Graves Registration Service hired Lenard to reconstruct the bones, small and large, of dead American soldiers. Eventually he found himself in remotest Brazil where he embarked on the translation of “Winnie the Pooh” into Latin, an eccentric task that catapulted him to brief world-wide fame. Sachs’ essay film uses personal letters, abstracted war imagery, home movies, interviews and a children’s performance to create an intimate meditation on the destructive power of war.","popularity":0.1881,"poster_path":"/90zow66ivgH9EzRTT3VD37vnDwn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Happy Day","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2719338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Israel John Gerendasi","original_name":"Israel John Gerendasi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sandor Lenard voice","credit_id":"5f176a9b7a1bd60035de9047","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2256175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ethan Mass","original_name":"Ethan Mass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150b6dce8a3e10043fc5d41","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"6150b6e4211ce5008f7ecf18","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"6150b75ba5d849008df89242","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"58249fe99251411a3e00bbbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2719340,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandor Lenard","original_name":"Sandor Lenard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f176aa451e6ab0037c4cb5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"5f176aab28723c0037d71c18","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2123323","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/90zow66ivgH9EzRTT3VD37vnDwn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
