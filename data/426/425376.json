In the 1830s, Young Count Piglovsky returns to his estate from Paris. The carriage in which he is riding is surrounded by rebellious peasants. Their attempt to hang the master is canceled almost at the last moment, because it is not the count in the carriage, but his lackey - Ustym Karmelyuk. Ustym really serves as a lackey in the count's house and at the same time leads a peasant uprising. The government sends the army. In a fierce fight, Karmelyuk is almost captured, but he is saved by one of the serfs.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/nfTqrqpWjeeJjcsjUBZgo8uUL2H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrainfilm","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1931-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karmelyuk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"False Uniforms","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Кармалюк","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"З життя Кармалюка","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"From the Life of Karmalyuk","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Karmalyuk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Podorozhniy","original_name":"Les Podorozhniy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/r369aQbBcy0l8TgsDUKZbt2I2P0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Count Piglovsky","credit_id":"582491ffc3a3684bf700b4f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stepan Shahaida","original_name":"Степан Шагайда","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/l78BXE9SQMEZpFtjgk3ASGlivM7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karmelyuk","credit_id":"58249218c3a3684bf700b4ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zinajda Pigulovich","original_name":"Zinajda Pigulovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kilina","credit_id":"582492289251411a4300ae79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Rovinskaya","original_name":"Valentina Rovinskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rosalie","credit_id":"58249238c3a3684bf500b5f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1706586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Borys Kallash-Verbytskyi","original_name":"Borys Kallash-Verbytskyi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sutonin","credit_id":"58249247c3a3684c14009e19","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
