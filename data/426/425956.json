This film explores the greatest inter-species friendship on Earth over the course of 40,000 years. Working closely with scientists, we deconstruct the genetic history of your favorite companion and explore how man has consistently re-engineered the dog to adapt to a changing world. An amazing story of how we have taken qualities we cherish from the wolf-loyalty, territory, protection and family-and bred them into a sweet, compliant animal that we call the dog.","popularity":0.1638,"poster_path":"/cPhr5ZjtqcFiG2yAvpC4F9yIR9W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Evolution From Wolves To Domesticated Dogs","title":"And Man Created Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1774128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Groat","original_name":"Rick Groat","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/7EEUEuZPTywi49emLV3nNOnH4Km.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Native Hunter","credit_id":"67a1ded953aeaa2b44e2d1b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin James Wolff","original_name":"Austin James Wolff","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/yLgOyIaaH8dlcmtyMFErt0RPQV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Caveboy","credit_id":"67a1df1aa45287b7fde2cfa7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre de Lespinois","original_name":"Pierre de Lespinois","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a1de3753aeaa2b44e2d179","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Copeland","original_name":"John Copeland","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a1de6aa45287b7fde2cf68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5224062,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Meg Olmert","original_name":"Meg Olmert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a1de9c6b9f666a9902fd06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1663879","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zaIWdS9RmsQmTm5HM5vHo2GeWiD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cPhr5ZjtqcFiG2yAvpC4F9yIR9W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15162,"name":"dog"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Geographic","release_date":"2010-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
