He had been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer in his early thirties and wanted me to document the craziness of his dying days, as he was buffeted from chemotherapy to New Age cures recommended by friends. I didn’t have the stomach to follow much of David’s last days. Meanwhile, Steve Ascher and I teamed up to go to Minneapolis. We wanted to ask strangers what in their lives they would like to have filmed. For me, it was almost like an act of expiation. -Ed Pincus via Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dkYp7sciGWzR8QOd3l2wZdKYE1D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life and Other Anxieties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Pincus","original_name":"Ed Pincus","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/24m0aUyeWTXmAtveXIXp9PMW2l1.jpg","credit_id":"58249f6d9251411a3e00bb81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3454488","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkYp7sciGWzR8QOd3l2wZdKYE1D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
