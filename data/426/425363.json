However, her daydreaming creates tension with her traditional mother, who wants a daughter that will settle down to get married, and Kanitha seems ambivalent to her father's deteriorating health. The family's struggle seems immutable, but Kanitha dreams an idea born from memories of her father. TURN LEFT TURN RIGHT is structured as an album, with tracks and sounds influencing the form. The film weaves Cambodian rock songs together with motifs of family, nature, and boundless imagination.","popularity":0.1533,"poster_path":"/47msqNgg0ycC2N9H6wDgufDRI5F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59723,"logo_path":"/oZH7BBpkGyMejjRMYYdhOaUgGyY.png","name":"Anti-Archive","origin_country":"KH"},{"id":221830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sea Oak Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn Left Turn Right","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanitha Tith","original_name":"Kanitha Tith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"582474359251411a4100a044","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thavy Pov","original_name":"Thavy Pov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"582474409251411a3800a23b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanthoeun Bo","original_name":"Vanthoeun Bo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5824744fc3a3684ea800233a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dy Saveth","original_name":"Dy Saveth","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/78dzqZqSGHzmX7fZtukSH9N5xhB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5824745cc3a3684bf500a607","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kavich Neang","original_name":"Kavich Neang","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/evVx1XkFxDO1ldckR79Kv9lNU5z.jpg","credit_id":"65dc36caed2ac2018741af98","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Chen","original_name":"Steve Chen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc3699ed2ac20164411297","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davy Chou","original_name":"Davy Chou","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/4xu0qdWpknHDCkY3REu3WYkT2YL.jpg","credit_id":"65dc36bea35c8e018614889e","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Chen","original_name":"Steve Chen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc39554539d00186bf6ec6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1519405,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Seok","original_name":"Douglas Seok","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6695035e3d891b359b6608f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1519405,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Seok","original_name":"Douglas Seok","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66950379dceadada3ea7f4ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6244728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g6rx726HsHRTt8yWImQM4hbGWVG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/47msqNgg0ycC2N9H6wDgufDRI5F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TURN LEFT TURN RIGHT (2016) - Official Trailer","key":"2F413rSuqY8","published_at":"2016-10-31T16:24:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"598cced69251414c52000a8e"}]}}}
