The urban and industrial fabric grew and was structured around the productive activity of that harbor, which, ever since the industrial crisis keeps declining. Pasaia Bitartean has its starting point in the architectural project with the same name that Jonander Agirre Mikelez made during the year 2013. The idea of articulating this project as a film came up as a consequence of the search of other methodologies to think the city and its common spaces.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/lb0jD4pC5lY5LDZo4xP1aY78w1d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tractora","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pasaia Bitartean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Usue Arrieta","original_name":"Usue Arrieta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f0c89251417b2302f05f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Vázquez","original_name":"Vicente Vázquez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f0eac3a368361402f28e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708411,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ana Aitana Fernández Moreno","original_name":"Ana Aitana Fernández Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f1469251417b18030981","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708414,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alvaro Sau Razkin","original_name":"Alvaro Sau Razkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f0949251417b2102fbda","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708415,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anjel Dueñas","original_name":"Anjel Dueñas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f0abc3a368623f00b829","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irati Gorostidi","original_name":"Irati Gorostidi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sLUyrahupQAJetl2tpqhTadyKjq.jpg","credit_id":"5828f0189251417b1d02f637","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708411,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ana Aitana Fernández Moreno","original_name":"Ana Aitana Fernández Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f0459251417b2302f013","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irati Gorostidi","original_name":"Irati Gorostidi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sLUyrahupQAJetl2tpqhTadyKjq.jpg","credit_id":"5828f104c3a368360f031cbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708418,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Ander Agirre Mikelez","original_name":"Jon Ander Agirre Mikelez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5828f1289251417b2c02f897","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irati Gorostidi","original_name":"Irati Gorostidi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sLUyrahupQAJetl2tpqhTadyKjq.jpg","credit_id":"5828efc29251417b260319a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10941788","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1230,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lb0jD4pC5lY5LDZo4xP1aY78w1d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":820}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"APTA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
