Дело «Промпартии»","overview":"In 1930, during what became known as the Industrial Party Trial, some members of the Soviet technical elite were tried for plotting to form a counter-revolutionary party. This documentary depicts that trial, in which a dozen men are prosecuted for crimes against the Russian Revolution. They promptly confess and are given the chance to address the court with an explanation. Full of remorse, they plead for the opportunity to pay off their debt to society by working. Then they wait for their sentence.","popularity":0.5547,"poster_path":"/qj5qlMXF2jZucoVCXMvwp6oQ9Xb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Studio of Documentary Films","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1930-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Industrial Party Process","title":"Thirteen Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"13 Days.
