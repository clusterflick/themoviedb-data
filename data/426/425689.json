Her mother Lore--who played the lead in The Ties That Bind (1984), a film about her experiences growing up in Germany during the Second World War--plays the lead again, this time kicking and protesting against being moved at the age of 94 from her home in Chicago to an “independent living” facility in New York. Friedrich and her two siblings fill out the supporting roles, cajoling, comforting, and freaking out.","popularity":0.0745,"poster_path":"/yMdbCBqQDPJB8UBMXAP6U5pcT1h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Cannot Tell You How I Feel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lore Bucher Friedrich","original_name":"Lore Bucher Friedrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66898cb71f8c4d2fc60c6e3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f0f8265c433ea00345b020a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Friedrich","original_name":"Maria Friedrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f0f825b60620a0033839f23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Friedrich","original_name":"Pete Friedrich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f0f8260c433ea00355b3fbf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"58274461c3a368360b01d652","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"582744739251417b2901bbea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"582744989251417b2901bbfc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"5827448fc3a368361401b63e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707465,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cathy Quinlan","original_name":"Cathy Quinlan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582744a69251417b2101b9cb","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"5f0f814460620a003583bdbb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cathy Nan Quinlan","original_name":"Cathy Nan Quinlan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f8150e22d280035c881e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7680418","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yMdbCBqQDPJB8UBMXAP6U5pcT1h.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gJx8ERgYsCIAKU6YE7cstoiJut.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VIENNALE Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
