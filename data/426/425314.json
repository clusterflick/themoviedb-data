This documentary establishes historical perspective on the measures initiated by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI which aimed to discredit black political figures and forces of the late 1960's and early 1970's.  Combining declassified documents, interviews, rare footage and exhaustive research, it investigates the government's role in the assassinations of Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, and Martin Luther King Jr. Were the murders the result of this concerted effort to avoid \"a Black Messiah\"?","popularity":1.2548,"poster_path":"/ljx7k9sxBxPpZVlLg1ZaBy6c1nm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The FBI's War on Black America","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.
