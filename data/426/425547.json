Amidst the chaos, children are constantly getting lost or temporarily misplaced, who when found are brought to this corner to wait till their parents or guardians are contacted. Numaish is an observational piece that looks at a few such occurrences and attempts to internalise that moment of being lost along with it's subjects.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Numaish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shubhangi Singh","original_name":"Shubhangi Singh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5825e2a09251417b1a00aa47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
