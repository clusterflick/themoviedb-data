This adventurous collage also features the filmmaker's own diaristic recollections (notably of being fitted for a diaphragm by a cold, intimidating doctor), poetical staged sequences, other women's audio testimonies, an old classroom instructional reel about menstruation, prose by Gertrude Stein and feminine \"ideals\" like the undulating young woman performing in fish-tail costumes at Florida's kitschy Weeki-Wachee Springs \"Underwater Mermaid Theater.\" - Dennis Harvey","popularity":0.2175,"poster_path":"/daceVGIa04xOIpEMwiQmklfgCzP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House of Science: A Museum of False Facts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The House of Science","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Beams","original_name":"Sarah Beams","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc860326c1900407ea78c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Dunne","original_name":"Amelia Dunne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc87090cf51003f4f99c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Frank","original_name":"Barbara Frank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc88390cf51003e4f4ef6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Gilbertson","original_name":"Stacey Gilbertson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc890d48cee003d0771cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tashwanna Harrell","original_name":"Tashwanna Harrell","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc89fe8131d003ed3ffc4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Large","original_name":"Amelia Large","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc8a9ea7b0e003c8b8fed","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LaDonna McKinney","original_name":"LaDonna McKinney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc8bdc99826003d9d94fd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2755712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Sachs","original_name":"Dana Sachs","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc8c97390c0003ef534f4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc8cfcdf2e6003f2f3385","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Alperin","original_name":"Leslie Alperin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc8ed35c30a003c4e2dd2","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigi DeRoux","original_name":"Gigi DeRoux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc8f6cdf2e6003d2efc38","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irish Higgens","original_name":"Irish Higgens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc900420228003fe82081","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Meyers","original_name":"Susan Meyers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc90dad59b5003ffcdc93","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Terwilliger","original_name":"Julie Terwilliger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5fffc920fea0d7003e8f85ba","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"5824a242c3a3684ed6003a8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas W.
