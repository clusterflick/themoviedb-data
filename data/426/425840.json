But when he falls in love with a murderous guest, he is thrown into a mad day of lies, backstabbing and chaos. As Bernard struggles to hide her murders from the other guests and suspicious authorities, his world literally begins to sink around him.","popularity":1.0241,"poster_path":"/2kH7YOPiojD7tqE7WFUFKGdZAFN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dresden Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A post-apocalyptic comedy about the last refuge for a traditional seaside holiday.","title":"The Fitzroy","video":false,"vote_average":6.458,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1216413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Anderson","original_name":"Jan Anderson","popularity":0.1877,"profile_path":"/fGt6BXghzQMsd4pzDckD1aFbN2P.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sonya","credit_id":"5904014ac3a3684a6800440e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Collard","original_name":"Kenneth Collard","popularity":0.8993,"profile_path":"/xUMUdN52gCIRjHzUc1uw1F0ZAfz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Inspector","credit_id":"59040156c3a3684a8e004099","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cerith Flinn","original_name":"Cerith Flinn","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bernard","credit_id":"5904015fc3a3684a68004425","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1806482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Robb","original_name":"Carol Robb","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mildred","credit_id":"59040195c3a3684a760040df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gant","original_name":"David Gant","popularity":0.4391,"profile_path":"/s5XZhuzETEbEIv4YanpR2Ng2URq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Thompson","credit_id":"590401a3c3a3684a4e004602","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Schaal","original_name":"David Schaal","popularity":0.3432,"profile_path":"/sJvYPUN5mv2LDqnf5mG3nBxCulx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cecil","credit_id":"590401ac92514169c0004403","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806475,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Harmer","original_name":"Andrew Harmer","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5904013892514169d000416d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806475,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Harmer","original_name":"Andrew Harmer","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5904013ec3a3684a68004402","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2289098","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9UuzeAmclp06thZL5d08sMrNWln.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tqZVO3H4w4SQJcNI2lRx7SBqbCs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2kH7YOPiojD7tqE7WFUFKGdZAFN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE FITZROY OFFICIAL TRAILER 2017","key":"JbezZ3oGOW4","published_at":"2017-04-10T03:20:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bd58bf9925141039b02823a"}]}}}
