Separated from the city by a river and bounded by towering sandstone cliffs, everyone attempts to live and survive in their own way. Foreigners who have a go at being Swiss, and Swiss who observe with scepticism. They meet in the corner shop run by an Iraqi living in exile, send their kids to a children’s club managed by a missionary, and old drinking mates meet regularly over a beer in the neighbourhood’s only bar. Despite all the differences, they are rather proud of the fact that they come from here.","popularity":0.7349,"poster_path":"/fhaHUd54MquFnT1bjH055fBToKu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biograph-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gyrischachen - von Sünden, Sofas und Cervelats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266839,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katharina Bhend","original_name":"Katharina Bhend","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632c75a7967cc70082169c26","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter von Siebenthal","original_name":"Peter von Siebenthal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632c75ce9f5dfb00832fc12a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Balthasar Jucker","original_name":"Balthasar Jucker","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632c761becbde9007b22dca5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2325773,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier JeanRichard","original_name":"Olivier JeanRichard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632c7630a3b5e6007de05d35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978152,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Graf","original_name":"Simon Graf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632c7652ecbde9009238a701","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sonja Mühlemann","original_name":"Sonja Mühlemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58273613c3a368361401adde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sonja Mühlemann","original_name":"Sonja Mühlemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5827361dc3a368360601c1b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Norbert Wiedmer","original_name":"Norbert Wiedmer","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5827363d9251417b2901b3a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707443,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Bürge","original_name":"Patrick Bürge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5827364ec3a36803810130e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Brantschen","original_name":"Christian Brantschen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5827366cc3a36836080192b5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5544278","wikidata_id":"Q27051557","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArnbKffJ4Ka2lQ1hvLzUuVzsl5o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1818}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fhaHUd54MquFnT1bjH055fBToKu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1169}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"},{"id":4090,"name":"colony"},{"id":5976,"name":"multiculturalism"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"GYRISCHACHEN - Von Sünden, Sofas und Cervelats (Trailer)","key":"swvPp1aD1tw","published_at":"2016-02-27T10:23:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"582738f49251417b2901b506"}]}}}
