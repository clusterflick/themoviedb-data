In something of a cross between a Keystone Kops comedy and an Edwin S. Porter melodrama, Lady Liberty, Justice (with her blindfold and scale) and Death form a love triangle, with fickle Death getting his comeuppance in the end. The marvelous musical soundtrack by Nik Phelps and live audience reactions to the film make this a warm and fuzzy experience, despite the archetypal gravity of the main characters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stupor Mundi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rock Ross","original_name":"Rock Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58249d10c3a3684c0100c482","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
