In his immigrant melodrama The Dressel Family, De Fuentes addresses the “problem” of the ferreteros: successful bourgeois German families who established their own self-sufficient community within Mexico City, but in doing so—it was widely felt—preserved their haughty colonialist attitudes toward the native population. The head of the Dressel household is a proud and stubborn German matriarch who, disdainful of her son’s mixed marriage, sets out to destroy the reputation of his young wife, a Mexican radio singer (played by the beautiful and talented Consuelo Frank).","popularity":0.121,"poster_path":"/wadf5gkMxi05q5F5unw7n3StLTQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179219,"logo_path":null,"name":"Impulsora Cinematográfica (ICSA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1935-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dressel Family","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1032549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Consuelo Frank","original_name":"Consuelo Frank","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/jJjwRYzWwdwRMxXWDaX3sshwVtZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Magdalena","credit_id":"582288199251410cb20039c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Vélez","original_name":"Jorge Vélez","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Federico / Friedric","credit_id":"5822883a9251410cbb003b6a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosita Arriaga","original_name":"Rosita Arriaga","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Frau Dressel","credit_id":"58228848c3a3683301003d2e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Armengod","original_name":"Ramón Armengod","popularity":0.1437,"profile_path":"/AcIheDdUoCwxiMS7Fut7ylQeVqp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gonzalo Ramirez","credit_id":"582288579251410ca9003cba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julián Soler","original_name":"Julián Soler","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/pqzJ9HbqA5kn2xwTEtNNItwOW2v.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rodolfo / Rudolph","credit_id":"582288689251410cbe003a3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":946906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Tamés","original_name":"Manuel Tamés","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Hans","credit_id":"62daca7590dde0010f382cb2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liebe Wolf","original_name":"Liebe Wolf","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Helga Petersen","credit_id":"62daca83b39e35004cf0d249","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando de Fuentes","original_name":"Fernando de Fuentes","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/cUxNMVBdV2OTsLTaWYaFRwRvpWu.jpg","credit_id":"62dac769c50ad20069dde1d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando de Fuentes","original_name":"Fernando de Fuentes","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/cUxNMVBdV2OTsLTaWYaFRwRvpWu.jpg","credit_id":"62dac771c50ad2005182ae81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633766,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan S.
