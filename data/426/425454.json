The film tumbles through a series of relationships woven around one woman's narration of her parents' marriage. This woman (played by Lilian Mafra) is a fresh and fecund personality who relates the story of her mother's infidelities while sitting naked and pregnant in a garden. Interspersed around this narrative are a number of other scenes which feeds the complex nature of human interaction. Interaction that is sometimes comic, sometimes lonely but, as the very pregnant Mafra indicates, inevitably part of life.","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Via Rio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Plays","original_name":"Dana Plays","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5824bd9f9251416d290012bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"1986-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
