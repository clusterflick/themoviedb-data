IN THE CONSERVATORY experimentally captures the essence of the place, through the use of direct animation, ambient sound, and music. Plants from the conservatoryâ€™s winter collection were gleaned and pasted onto clear, 16mm film leader, then re-photographed on an optical printer while they were still fresh, resulting in a second, chance animation. The soundtrack combines ambient sound recorded in the Conservatory with a performance of a Samuel Barber composition, featuring Lucy Goeres on flute and Eliza Garth on piano.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Conservatory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caryn Cline","original_name":"Caryn Cline","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5824c5889251416d220018d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
