Serra presents her unique vision of eroticism and poetic cinema in a fast-paced collage of dreamlike imagery. Fragments of a poem by C. Breeze are read and manipulated in a manner recalling the tape experiments of Steve Reich. Rich reds and deep blues stutter and sparkle along with her descriptions of love and \"canine sex.\" TURNER is a brief glimpse at Serra's roots in the New York avant-garde and the Film-makers' Cooperative.","popularity":0.0838,"poster_path":"/i9wM2TzIMarL2ZpJoBwI80icZT7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.M.
