The squadron's deputy commander, Captain Eitan Rom is threatened by the appearance of his new commander, who seems to him to be irresponsible and inexperienced to the point of endangering the pilots. The power struggle between them causes tensions and dysfunction of the squadron. When the two crash land together in enemy territory, they are forced to learn to work with each other to survive. Upon their return to the squadron and the outbreak of the Six Day War, the two face a decisive battle and realize that only through cooperation will they be able to lead the squadron to victory. Love also has a place. Eitan, who is in love with Galia, the operations officer, learns precisely from his rival Ran how to overcome his fears and succeed.","popularity":0.3941,"poster_path":"/fVhBkeGCGVst3JbEQKpiILzTylb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36067,"logo_path":"/r8PzYwMEhQzo8kRh8bAOHIXVJs7.png","name":"Topia
