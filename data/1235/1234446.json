Tallamy provides the narrative thread that challenges the notion that humans are here and nature is someplace else. “It doesn’t have to, and shouldn’t be that way.” Inspiring stories of community commitment to conservation landscaping illustrate Tallamy’s vision by showing how humans and nature can co-exist with mutual benefits.","popularity":0.5745,"poster_path":"/81dHTmUwqy3UUqgbPy1UD6Q67Uf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hometown Habitat, Stories of Bringing Nature Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4609136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Tallamy","original_name":"Douglas Tallamy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65fdf29104733f0164e8d466","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Zimmerman","original_name":"Catherine Zimmerman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65add358158c8500ac1c24fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6215020","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/81dHTmUwqy3UUqgbPy1UD6Q67Uf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":166471,"name":"gardening"},{"id":281121,"name":"landscaping"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
