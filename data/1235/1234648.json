Six months later it was recaptured by Ukraine. Left in the ruins of the town, residents are now grappling with questions of guilt and complicity. This film reconstructs the mechanisms of the occupation with those who lived through it: those who were at some point able to flee, and those who stayed. The documentary hears from residents who collaborated as well as those who resisted, whether openly or in secret. It illustrates a panorama of life under occupation and poses the big questions of guilt and complicity.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Russia Comes: Fear and Loyalty in a Ukrainian Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Sokolova","original_name":"Hanna Sokolova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ae58acd100b6010c824de5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathias Bölinger","original_name":"Mathias Bölinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ae58a625cd8500cb4e5def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
