Following the death of his foster parents, the boy is sold by his uncle Ah Sam to a blind Taoist priest, an abusive man. Running away from home, Yip is hit by a car and sent to a school for the blind by the social security workers. His talents impress the musician Siu Kwong and wins him a place in a music school for the blind. There he is joined by fellow students Lung Kwok-kei, a runaway child with an abusive stepmother, Chow Kuen, an abandoned child found on a train, and Cheung Kin-ching, an avid music lover sent to the school by her loving well-to-do father. The four children blossom into accomplished musicians under the tutelage of Siu and his wife and together with the less fortunate others, form an orchestra which earns a reputation for excellence.","popularity":0.3357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tao Yuen Motion Picture Development
