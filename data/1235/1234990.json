In 2011 thousands of Wisconsin citizens occupied the State House and the streets surrounding the capitol to protest the stripping of collective bargaining power from Wisconsin's public employees by the Republican-controlled legislature and newly elected governor Scott Walker. Dramatic footage shows more than 10,000 Wisconsinites pouring into the capitol, and Republican Senators fleeing on a secret shuttle. While Republican legislators invented new laws to restrict access by citizens—and even elected officials—to the State House, the occupation persisted.","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":"/nKYR2mgERHOaAFtlK6xbejpQbdk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lower Third","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wisconsin Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Mayfield","original_name":"Sam Mayfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af4f216af8f800af8a94fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Mayfield","original_name":"Sam Mayfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2ec103fe7970162fdea6e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Mayfield","original_name":"Sam Mayfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2f1792476f20163fe35e6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Mayfield","original_name":"Sam Mayfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2f16fa5890201641c4e37","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2914756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"WisconsinRising","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"WisconsinRising"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1456,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jZknN8CXMJBTHAqvXeFT5kBlqRS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":971},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2131,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nKYR2mgERHOaAFtlK6xbejpQbdk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1420}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Barrymore Madison Theatre, Madison, WI","release_date":"2013-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Wisconsin Film Festival","release_date":"2014-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vermont Int'l Film Festival","release_date":"2013-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Orlando Film Fest","release_date":"2014-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2014-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wisconsin Rising Documentary Trailer","key":"xk4vycAgZUk","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-20T21:18:22.000Z","id":"65c2f0bbc15f890149f486fb"}]}}}
