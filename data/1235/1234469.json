Over an 18 month period, King and her crew followed the teenage members of a graffiti 'crew,' Vandals on the Street, as they painted and rapped and moved through the streets of downtown Newark. What emerges is a unique glimpse behind the 'tags' at the kind of inner city kids who write on walls, but who also make art; who create out of wedlock children, but who also form binding relationships; who drop out of school and never read a book, but who create their own brand of poetry through the medium of 'rap.'","popularity":1.372,"poster_path":"/kkQ7h63vFT6QflpPtImtFYIt7xD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13456,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Jersey Network (NJN)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Writing on the Wall","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Too Sweet Hakeem","original_name":"Too Sweet Hakeem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65ae0122ad59b5010b149d49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Danzig","original_name":"Phil Danzig","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65ae016abd588b00ca62a281","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carlin","original_name":"John Carlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65ae01a3848eb900ca4e2622","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Crane","original_name":"Roberta Crane","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65ae01c367b61300eb528579","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1048446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Chalfant","original_name":"Henry Chalfant","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zI4ZH5rt0AVZBPSbbEkj07MzDgv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65ae021225cd8500accacec4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493515,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra King","original_name":"Sandra King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ae0280f263ba00cbe7f800","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yKhy8LUbj9ipaaSlvkxGPMvqKC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kkQ7h63vFT6QflpPtImtFYIt7xD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":898,"name":"hip-hop"},{"id":2394,"name":"ghetto"},{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":2016,"name":"vandalism"},{"id":155418,"name":"subculture"},{"id":161728,"name":"urban decay"},{"id":208289,"name":"1980s"},{"id":242921,"name":"rap"},{"id":285182,"name":"newark, new jersey"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hip Hop In Newark, N.J. 1986","key":"-LYCPRNSct8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-24T23:16:34.000Z","id":"65ae0429f8aee800cbb045d7"}]}}}
