Its walls were crowded with banned and forgotten works by artists such as Malevich, Tatlin, Kandinsky, Chagall, Lissitzky, Rodchenko, and Kliun; public figures such as Edward Kennedy, Stravinsky, and Alfred Barr visited. Barrie Gavin met the collector in 1982 at his home in Athens. Costakis, a Greek born in Russia, passionately shares his story and those of the great Russian avant-garde artists. Their works are his legacy â€“ without him, they would not have survived the political upheavals in Russia.","popularity":0.4432,"poster_path":"/zkaW8tklHt9dSjdU9n64aK8vXZL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Costakis: The Collector","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyndon Brook","original_name":"Lyndon Brook","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/gSXN0fYj0lhIBHaGVsUJwTTB6vx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65ae3b3d3e2ec800ebefdcc9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barrie Gavin","original_name":"Barrie Gavin","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/vd9FnvkRUcz5HXY13kX6eLCuajv.jpg","credit_id":"65ae3b57d100b600cb80d8a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31014638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zkaW8tklHt9dSjdU9n64aK8vXZL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":864},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/P9ICDzMPZcxYOPwiUZWZ9LCI5H.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3660,"name":"art collector"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":280860,"name":"russian art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
