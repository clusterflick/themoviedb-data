Having come from her country (located in present-day Yemen) with a caravan and gifts to meet this king known for his wisdom and glory, the queen Balkis embarks on a seduction campaign that soon succeeds. However, she obscurely feels that she will have no real power over him until she breaks down this obstacle between them: his faith.","popularity":0.1409,"poster_path":"/9yCts98RiE504k75sXvNL2XYLx3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1975-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La reine de Saba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludmilla Tchérina","original_name":"Ludmilla Tchérina","popularity":0.1396,"profile_path":"/nc0mnD7issFwrmQFw99HJjHXn0d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Balkis, la reine de Saba","credit_id":"675969602be15811b44f054f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric de Pasquale","original_name":"Frédéric de Pasquale","popularity":0.2273,"profile_path":"/c5Xx3J1admtiRftfR4ANUrbfUGW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Le roi Salomon","credit_id":"67596997a174bb78f4a5907c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valiyollah Shirandami","original_name":"Valiyollah Shirandami","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Le grand-prêtre","credit_id":"67596a4d65ef4e91d7e8ccbc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1416719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Behrouz Behnejad","original_name":"Behrouz Behnejad","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/9RitPTk70kdbMsc0xAvNwDsRiNr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"679eb057176fdb2244cb5c3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Apick","original_name":"Mary Apick","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/6syxT2QNGSDPdUfXJtZF2vi6Koh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"679eb073f0f9dbdba69557b6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Koralnik","original_name":"Pierre Koralnik","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65add448158c85010a9fd515","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Clavel","original_name":"Maurice Clavel","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/4b3y5VJ02Xeq6Dh79ClcTkV5Jtn.jpg","credit_id":"67596a84a6347ac4d3874350","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Clavel","original_name":"Maurice Clavel","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/4b3y5VJ02Xeq6Dh79ClcTkV5Jtn.jpg","credit_id":"67596b02ef269d0b88e3a28e","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Koralnik","original_name":"Pierre Koralnik","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67596b2139b533d942486baf","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Chapier","original_name":"Henry Chapier","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":"/39QyqVJxoJNxh1Byvz1HWPqUCik.jpg","credit_id":"67596b450b15bdb9ec1f38c9","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39338,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Éric Demarsan","original_name":"Éric Demarsan","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb0aba57909701acb4f9b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Leclerc","original_name":"Georges Leclerc","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb0cf176fdb2244cb5c4e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345408,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hélène Arnal","original_name":"Hélène Arnal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb62502a74dc73f953a14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0072077","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9yCts98RiE504k75sXvNL2XYLx3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
