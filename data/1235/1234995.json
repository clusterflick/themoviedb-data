When it falls, the pair is eliminated. This exercise in collaboration involves intimacy: faces are only an orange apart. It involves embraces, though not loving so much as keeping the partner in tension. Pacifying their natural energy with an eerie, giggly humming, the children shuffle like old marrieds at a tea dance, united and separated by a scandalous orange globe. Eyes sockets and cheekbones prove useless against roundness; even the winning couple’s triumph is short-lived.","popularity":0.1347,"poster_path":"/lZshTPPBT73kOq1sMe53cws0HSj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2022-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #34: Appelsindans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af54b36af8f800ed9e78d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af54be71ffdf00eb75c7f6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3287478,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rafael Ortega","original_name":"Rafael Ortega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af54ceaad9c200ca5a76e8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af54de25cd8500cb4ee6e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"65af54ef6af8f8010c9731f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495248,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Farzad Soleimani","original_name":"Farzad Soleimani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af551539756100cb2297de","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1694,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZshTPPBT73kOq1sMe53cws0HSj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1129}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
