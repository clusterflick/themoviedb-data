They named themselves The Rising Storm and the album was called  \"Calm Before.\" The boys graduated, went on to college and to pursue careers having nothing to do with music. What happened when the one of the 500 hundred original copies of the album, turned up in Europe decades later and ignited a craze across the continent. This was unbeknownst to the band members, who had graduated from the finest colleges in the east and were all pursuing successful careers in law, medicine, and journalism. But the story continued to spread and the legend of The Rising Storm grew.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iWVC5H7agbiNuc0iL8DUP1SKSjF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"calm before…the rising storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Weinberg","original_name":"Richard Weinberg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65aee2a63e2ec800aec3ef24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Rockwell","original_name":"Charlie Rockwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65aee2b6bd588b010b5d9157","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Scheft","original_name":"Tom Scheft","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65aee2c6aad9c200ca5a1d03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Cohen","original_name":"Todd Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65aee2d325cd8500accb2fe2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Thompson","original_name":"Tony Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65aee2de848eb900ca4e849f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Cohan","original_name":"Bob Cohan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65aee2f0ad59b500ca64d966","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Brier","original_name":"Andrew Brier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aee30b544c4100ae252ae9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4494602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Brier","original_name":"Andrew Brier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aee31771ffdf00ad7eb99e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iWVC5H7agbiNuc0iL8DUP1SKSjF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
