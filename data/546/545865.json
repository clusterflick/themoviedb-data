There are bits of black and white film from his childhood spending holidays in Italyas a boy.\r The audience adores him and his voice soars easily as such songs are easy on someone used to much heavier Verdi or Wagner roles. A delight to the ear.","popularity":0.2249,"poster_path":"/aIWWVHe9duh0xQhOo35OX54qu7F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jonas Kaufmann: Dolce Vita","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5df9186b65686e00138a484b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Sommer","original_name":"Andy Sommer","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df918acbe2d49001450f983","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rqYpcClaklUlSbL4GgqLKSxLpWx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dcdVLASDW54r3GI9mf9TMJIH93l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aIWWVHe9duh0xQhOo35OX54qu7F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
