In her early years, Susan remembers her upsetting home life which she endured until she made her bid for freedom and went to college. Frustrated by her broken home, she tries to realign her sensitivity, only to be disrupted time and again by the \"new morality\" of her recent college atmosphere. It is sometime later that Susan meets Gloria; an artist both in her painting and lifestyle who introduces her to a new and healthy view of sex.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gY1AMe6uB1AW0W03G6PMyFsmEnZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Honey Pot Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":1955,"logo_path":null,"name":"VCX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Candy Lips","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":101148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan McBain","original_name":"Susan McBain","popularity":6.946,"profile_path":"/kWAUSfmegmKsdAhU53Rj6LfucNM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lilah","credit_id":"5b86583b0e0a26110f008923","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2149085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette Sinclair","original_name":"Jeanette Sinclair","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lilah's Mother","credit_id":"618774b6e741460060f8f950","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3300110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lois Luv","original_name":"Lois Luv","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lilah's Sister","credit_id":"618774ef75f1ad002747c9f5","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2117460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Daniels","original_name":"Barbara Daniels","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/n8Rm9rKL4FreWanddSq3T6t98kZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Ladies","credit_id":"5b8658c10e0a26110f008996","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2117459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominatia","original_name":"Dominatia","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Ladies","credit_id":"5b8658ab0e0a261116009276","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":104159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Leonard","original_name":"Gloria Leonard","popularity":8.804,"profile_path":"/uAqnOgj5IZ4XBjBS06r1KOdtkPs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Ladies","credit_id":"5b8658760e0a26111c008dd4","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":98374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlene Willoughby","original_name":"Marlene Willoughby","popularity":9.208,"profile_path":"/nXK4m7DqzJtDZpJqmzYdBZkiH6g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Ladies","credit_id":"5b86589292514149eb007740","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3300112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blaine Edmonds","original_name":"Blaine Edmonds","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Gentlemen","credit_id":"61877513d388ae0043ffcbc9","order":7},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1772800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Williams","original_name":"David Williams","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Gentlemen","credit_id":"61877577595a560043901558","order":8},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":100399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Teague","original_name":"Jake Teague","popularity":3.073,"profile_path":"/lZQdOUhRHzGMCSEHT7KvFaGx6fp.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lilah's Father","credit_id":"618775981fd36f008fb407d6","order":9},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":71544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herschel Savage","original_name":"Herschel Savage","popularity":5.709,"profile_path":"/8Y5DRoX3VsTbfXKLHmsV60a3j84.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Gentlemen","credit_id":"618775a5e74146002b77265d","order":10},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":104529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ras Kean","original_name":"Ras Kean","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/orBNC4apkBkpokgbNhwpfdSDKqT.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"The Gentlemen","credit_id":"618775eecb6db50042c3ec60","order":11},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2294246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Austin","original_name":"Terry Austin","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"The Gentlemen","credit_id":"618775d363a69500685f939f","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2117454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecil B.
