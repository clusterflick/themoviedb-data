Upon learning that his mother was a prostitute, Frank (Daniel Gelin) dejectedly vows that he, too, will live a life of debauchery. Part of his self-degradation program is to kill someone, and since the story takes place during the Nazi occupation of France, he chooses a German officer as his victim. His steady descent into psychosis and depravity becomes his ultimate undoing.","popularity":0.5417,"poster_path":"/jemKpla0wjYLnFFXwNWTS1tIOnC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films
