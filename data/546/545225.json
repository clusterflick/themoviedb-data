Originally from the southern Philippines, he has decided to stay in Manila not only for work opportunities but also for the comfort and freedom of urban living. But staying in Manila isn’t easy— and it isn’t cheap either. He accepts freelance design and animation work, sells beauty products, joins a community lending scheme, and thinks of renting a whole flat in BLISS and lease its rooms to others to earn and save money. One day, his mother calls and asks him to come home. She is worried about his financial troubles and offers to help.Reluctantly, he agrees and uses this opportunity to connect again with his family, especially with his mother whose values have always been old-fashioned.","popularity":0.0636,"poster_path":"/tt4EJ6t0EcYfIC42YYZC9Xb1bjG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boda Media Group","origin_country":""},{"id":141208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pananaw Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God BLISS Our Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lawrence S.
