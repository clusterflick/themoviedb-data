FIRE MUSIC showcases the architects of a movement whose radical brand of improvisation pushed harmonic and rhythmic boundaries, and produced landmark albums like Coleman's Free Jazz: A Collective Inspiration and Coltrane's Ascension. A rich trove of archival footage conjures the 1960s jazz scene along with incisive reflections by critic Gary Giddins and a number of the movement's key players.","popularity":0.7015,"poster_path":"/polpaEFNQnihvh1w1fgPSeE5N6d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A history of the free jazz revolution.","title":"Fire Music","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Surgal","original_name":"Tom Surgal","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665bbc1a7ea6ccd4a1e7829f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurston Moore","original_name":"Thurston Moore","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/5MFuvfhH1S0X6lTrJxq3QywG0Dn.jpg","credit_id":"665bbc404c00efeed906fc8c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nels Cline","original_name":"Nels Cline","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665bbc538d79306483e772fd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Surgal","original_name":"Tom Surgal","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665bbc67541ba60ee047ef1a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Surgal","original_name":"Tom Surgal","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b884425c3a3681fdd01589c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5317302","wikidata_id":"Q60737792","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bbtpRZoOF1ytWNGIlEqHftf60c5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/39zeL1TTZnaKkWwmQ4Tg5JtZ1wr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yYy4XeG0sq6Xby83w018VfSoJPU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gnvX1sHRyOE7WVa6t32aJFSs1xU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":6.406,"height":212,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4GltsC3bD3vcVlcYAgTQkgrb9rI.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/polpaEFNQnihvh1w1fgPSeE5N6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/593FieYoVn3qKAzoqOVtCgLF5EX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":196052,"name":"instrumental jazz"},{"id":197367,"name":"free jazz"},{"id":308818,"name":"avant garde"},{"id":338383,"name":"avant garde jazz"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5317302/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_rdat (56th New York Film Festival)","release_date":"2021-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"pVxRL9HAvCI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-08-31T18:55:21.000Z","id":"63484784cf4a640098a1e0ad"}]}}}
