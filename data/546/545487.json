The fragments are edited by superimposing the different takings of the same scenes. The image produced is strange because we are facing an impossible : the simultaneous presence of several states that could be.

This sentimental and visual disorder is combined with the overlay of sound samples : inner music and movies dialogues.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4FUziYVpNih7BO6UDPNdc50O809.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Guérin","original_name":"Christophe Guérin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b880ae39251412d3200cf53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4FUziYVpNih7BO6UDPNdc50O809.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":773}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
