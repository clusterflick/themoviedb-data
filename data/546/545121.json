Both Iimuras play individually as well as a unit. In \"Double Portrait\" they are never together, but one by one in three points of view, front, side, and back, assigned to the words \"I\", \"You\" and \"He/She\" respectively. The pronouns rotate with every repetition, for instance, in front view with \"You\", then \"He/She\" and back to \"I\". Often the words are destroyed acoustically making them unintelligible. \"I Love You\" is not a style of confession, but the words, and a linguistic  practice using a sentence and shifting the pronouns.","popularity":0.0753,"poster_path":"/nnYjqHAxbKslY0hOPOxzeEirZ9u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","credit_id":"5b8598a892514159e70560ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nnYjqHAxbKslY0hOPOxzeEirZ9u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
