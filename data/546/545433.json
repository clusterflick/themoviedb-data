A restless public is re-awakening long after her death fueled by the recordings of her anti-government speeches. Jeremy's new job entails rewriting her words and her visual image; nullifying and softening the impact of her heartfelt rhetoric. While working to comprehend her lectures, to effectively alter them, he chooses a taboo course of action; he dumps her stored memory into an android body made in her likeness. This brings him dangerously close to her and her message.","popularity":0.1921,"poster_path":"/4MaqaQKkSuPIHhJ3vUUw8JrWPcO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams from a Petrified Head","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Dechart","original_name":"Bryan Dechart","popularity":0.8515,"profile_path":"/snfYiW0GDDMUtr2s1dgQkSUR7Y1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeremy","credit_id":"5b98fb37925141726800bde9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929960,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Daniel Ouellette","original_name":"Daniel Ouellette","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8794690e0a266f2b009d08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730502,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Goldman","original_name":"Jason Goldman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8795db9251412d47009fd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929960,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Daniel Ouellette","original_name":"Daniel Ouellette","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b879451c3a3681fe8008f13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2156751","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hxOnlfnH8Q6nihCqcyWRBDMXs0O.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74bcNJ01sWQ5ne9mwKRZYlYfwQ1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4MaqaQKkSuPIHhJ3vUUw8JrWPcO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
