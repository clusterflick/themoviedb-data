Katherine is desperate enough that she is considering marrying the wealthy Montee Buck (Hiers), although she is in love with the westerner Tom Jaffrey (Fillmore), who says he is poor. Finally, Katherine decides to sell the famous Van Riper pearls, pay off her debts, and marry Tom. However, upon examination the jewelry turns out to be paste, with her father having sold the genuine pearls several years earlier before his death. Montee is assured by the aunts that Katherine will marry him and tells this to Tom. Tom is about to leave town when Uncle James (Ricketts) steps in and pays off Katherine's debts, leaving the niece free to marry Tom.","popularity":0.3536,"poster_path":"/28VU7ARUuRcDsreuIy8vkQDKNhr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sham","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Clayton","original_name":"Ethel Clayton","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/pEKusLCieVqAOEfRB2CXAtibTeZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Katherine Van Riper","credit_id":"60119e16cb802800400547ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clyde Fillmore","original_name":"Clyde Fillmore","popularity":0.1784,"profile_path":"/9W1adfcqErWd7Y4pFhZ61II5AKU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Jaffrey","credit_id":"60119e1ca35c8e003e61fbce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Roberts","original_name":"Theodore Roberts","popularity":0.285,"profile_path":"/zyNQbifLkL42CaVvRKh2tG659q4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jeriamiah Buck","credit_id":"60119e22cb80280041093fae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Ashton","original_name":"Sylvia Ashton","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/s18TRWa31RZYb5CUkFAQRhlt0TR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt Bella","credit_id":"60119e27fd4a96003f323a49","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Hiers","original_name":"Walter Hiers","popularity":0.1245,"profile_path":"/u0OR95aRdkx4BdT91k3bF6itiGl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Montee Buck","credit_id":"60119e2ca6ddcb003eb20c9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Dunbar","original_name":"Helen Dunbar","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/nErEJVdKwRlDuOH6rcBx5isXKWL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Aunt Louisa","credit_id":"6195a24d71458f008aece765","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","original_name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/oU2gb8ZKlXfdze6JcLJCAQTH5i6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bolton (as Arthur Carewe)","credit_id":"6195a2749512e10062ebc733","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ricketts","original_name":"Tom Ricketts","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/66ezBnrNzoiL82VNBjo6NTAYHns.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Uncle James (as Thomas Ricketts)","credit_id":"6195a2a3eb14fa0092439848","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Gray","original_name":"Blanche Gray","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Clementine Vickers","credit_id":"6195a2b441aac4006237a3d6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eunice Burnham","original_name":"Eunice Burnham","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Maud Buck","credit_id":"6195a2c371458f002a9d8c2f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1392579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Clark Ward","original_name":"Carrie Clark Ward","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/6GG6DbiwFPtHHmT7bewtdfqQgiA.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Rosie","credit_id":"6195a2daabdafc002a200621","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douglas Z.
