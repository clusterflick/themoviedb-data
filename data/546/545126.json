Once there, he meets Marjory Seaton, an heiress whom her Uncle Tidmarsh is trying to marry to the profligate Winslow, but she is interested in fashionable sportsman Sylvester. One night at a ball, Gordon spies Jenks following him and, in the course of his escape, accepts refuge from a fight promoter named Brooks. At Brooks' request, Gordon substitutes for Sylvester's opponent, burglar Deacon, at a charity bout, and knocks out the real pugilist. Later, during a dinner party at the Tidmarshes', Gordon is mistaken for a lord and, when the real nobleman appears, is denounced as an impostor.
