Framed by footage of the encampment locally known as Dinkinsville on New York's Lower East Side, where some of the homeless of Thompkins Square Park settled after the riots of June 1991, the movie begins with the encampment's first night and ends with the fire and subsequent destruction of the lot in October of the same year. Applying rhythmic construction, poetic license and a generous eye to bodies in poverty, B/side documents beautifully a gritty vision of late 20th century urban life.  â€”Kurzfilmtage - international short film festival Oberhausen","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/sB0pXzCvlACmLtFSWwomiLuizCH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B/Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abigail Child","original_name":"Abigail Child","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b855ed6c3a368654e04f7ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0124990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hkvqVqPEvJ3WkpGvLTDRMuMOFd1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sB0pXzCvlACmLtFSWwomiLuizCH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
