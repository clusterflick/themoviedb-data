He gives the company president Gage a tour of the area of land coveted for its use as a short cut that can save hours on the journey. After the officials visit a recently constructed dam, the train makes a stop in a dull town, and Gage's daughter Laura throws a charity bazaar to combat the boredom. Jim puts together a mock-holdup that saves the event from financial ruin, endearing Laura to him. Later, an accident traps three workers in a cave, and Jim is called away to rescue the victims.","popularity":0.1045,"poster_path":"/fAKr5jM72hN7kJvst17NsK1xSlZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"LOOK OUT FOR THE CARS!","title":"The Love Special","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jim Glover","credit_id":"5b85aae8c3a368329d000082","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Ayres","original_name":"Agnes Ayres","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/mQObJxwBA3epElaMwpDsXCvaQeH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Laura Gage","credit_id":"5b85aaf50e0a2603a1000024","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Roberts","original_name":"Theodore Roberts","popularity":0.285,"profile_path":"/zyNQbifLkL42CaVvRKh2tG659q4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Railroad President Gage","credit_id":"5b85ab040e0a2603aa00002e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Whitlock","original_name":"Lloyd Whitlock","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/d40IzxpR4hFo7la0UB0whpYu1up.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Allen Harrison","credit_id":"5b85ab13c3a36832910000bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Ashton","original_name":"Sylvia Ashton","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/s18TRWa31RZYb5CUkFAQRhlt0TR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Whitney","credit_id":"5b85ab24925141385b000084","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2117118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Gaden","original_name":"William Gaden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"William Bucks","credit_id":"5b85ab32c3a36832940000c6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Morris Blood","credit_id":"5b85ab3f0e0a2603ad00007b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snitz Edwards","original_name":"Snitz Edwards","popularity":0.1314,"profile_path":"/hZzvzPNMoo9FhvBTURdsuMKY1fR.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Zeka Logan","credit_id":"5b85ab4e92514138660000bf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2048265,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ernest Butterworth","original_name":"Ernest Butterworth","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"'Gloomy'","credit_id":"5b85ab5d925141384d0000d8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2117119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zelma Maja","original_name":"Zelma Maja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Stenographer","credit_id":"5b85ab6ac3a36832970000dd","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231255,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank H.
