So I bought a Super 8 camera and photography equipment. The first film I produced was the best I ever made. I shot on black-and-white stock and kept the camera trained on a single cloud for three minutes. The cloud slowly changed shape and floated away.’ In the cloud, Hafif seized on a motif with a long tradition in the history of painting. The film’s ‘action’, too, prompts associations with painting: the sky appears as a ground on which the clouds stirs like a mass of paint applied with a brush. A bird crossing the screen anchors the scenery in the specific filming location: California’s Pacific coast.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":"/uBlxjYpjrqX5TWvY8Y8vJZk3V09.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2118872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcia Hafif","original_name":"Marcia Hafif","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tRbXnwXEdvSciptT2r6aItCpTcA.jpg","credit_id":"5b8942380e0a2679b100dfe7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uBlxjYpjrqX5TWvY8Y8vJZk3V09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
