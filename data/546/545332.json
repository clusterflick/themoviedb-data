A romantic hide-away, Marie Antoinette conceived it as a reminder of her carefree youth in Vienna. The Revolution left it for a ruin. 230 years after its construction, it reopens to the public, restored to its original glory, as an extraordinary jewel of Versailles. Following the restoration, this docudrama in 4K uncovers Marie Antoinette’s greatness as a master of fashion and revisit the saga of France’s legendary Queen. An intimate portrait of a ‘too-modern woman’ caught in the whirlwinds of History.","popularity":0.6654,"poster_path":"/9zzqLDNleCNGlyzGJt0CgxL6mKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Versailles of Marie-Antoinette","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Marie-Antoinettes hemmelige Versailles","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagen Howard","original_name":"Dagen Howard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1becc41b1f3c003570ab4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2721939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurélia Frachon","original_name":"Aurélia Frachon","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/itl20c0T8vAspB64FW0tu8wVedU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1beccd66a7c30038ffe21c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2721941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Metral","original_name":"Nathan Metral","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1becde0e597b003335772a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Truchi","original_name":"Christophe Truchi","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1becf31b1f3c003871ff2a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1429692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Le Goff","original_name":"Christine Le Goff","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ca7b7103726401879b2ece","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472628,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoan Cart","original_name":"Yoan Cart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ca7b7be4b576016415a6f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2933918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Landreau","original_name":"Alexandre Landreau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ca7bbece6c4c017cbc4085","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870615,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylviane Bouget","original_name":"Sylviane Bouget","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ca7bcdaaec71016259e3eb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2117726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Daniels","original_name":"Mark Daniels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b86de9ec3a3683f8101441a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2117725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvie Faiveley","original_name":"Sylvie Faiveley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b86de69c3a3683f880107ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7414302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dBQ5bdh59SHQbtTfLLeR9m0tMG1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9zzqLDNleCNGlyzGJt0CgxL6mKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Deutsch\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"Deutsch\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
