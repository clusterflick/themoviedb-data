A story about the life in the world of gangs whose soldiers know only one language – violence. Rape, extortion, brutal beatings… Two families found themselves in the hell from which it is not easy or maybe impossible to escape. Marabunta are extremely dangerous legionary ants that always attack in a group and destroy everything that stands in their way. They also gave the name to maras – ruthless and brutal gangs terrorising the streets in El Salvador as well as Los Angeles.","popularity":0.4339,"poster_path":"/bWVYTKeURSLRs8nhZtft05Ibxjv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Globomedia","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maras","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2025254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Ayuso","original_name":"Omar Ayuso","popularity":0.7646,"profile_path":"/c4bAqv3PoSVK4ov7cw076NNqg6f.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc81a9ab2681f003f9264c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Isabel Díaz Lago","original_name":"María Isabel Díaz Lago","popularity":0.3828,"profile_path":"/wwSEXt9QqMcwI5oDZWzFbj2q6XO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc81abeb0040a0040240b21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Prieto","original_name":"Raúl Prieto","popularity":0.2681,"profile_path":"/osXhdIeQ44FTJIOOtJfP2yQ15tA.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc81b222d8ef3003f5fcc9d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1809533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Édgar Vittorino","original_name":"Édgar Vittorino","popularity":0.3347,"profile_path":"/2To4LGDx2mNSaunFAH84l6BBjbj.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc81b6f383df2003c55c985","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Óscar Zafra","original_name":"Óscar Zafra","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/latkUliJh9WcQXucVzChFlw6Z11.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc81b7a3f8ede0040ffb8bb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1473973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salvador Calvo","original_name":"Salvador Calvo","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/9Mo7WS5kZBoaZpQWQXI9WvoTYXi.jpg","credit_id":"5d740a50209f180012fcabba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313981,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel Sánchez","original_name":"Manuel Sánchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81a4e2811a100409feb75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766800,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jaime Colis","original_name":"Jaime Colis","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81a68681888003f1de979","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586204,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Juanjo Sánchez","original_name":"Juanjo Sánchez","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xwpBBw3ajjBcTdb31iXBv79V1hX.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81a5a680be8004015eb45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324224,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrés Cuenca","original_name":"Andrés Cuenca","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81a7d3f8ede0040ffb7b5","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2115410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alejandro Hernández","original_name":"Alejandro Hernández","popularity":0.1488,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81a343f8ede003effb6d3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10002068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qVAEGUXMy807klyKafLK05qTmgg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i190SW64Nrla9AoLd4DHwcdrizg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u0X46np8rx9Rgj1Vfd2JPAt4hyK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bWVYTKeURSLRs8nhZtft05Ibxjv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"[object Object]","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
