A small water drop that just landed on a wild flower to tell its story from a long itinerary.

I can’t be a part of it.’ A visual poem portraying an existential struggle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofie Lee","original_name":"Sofie Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d723b2c77c01f00145c7b04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
