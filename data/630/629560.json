But does real life compare? We follow some of the most daring archaeologists and take on the dangers they face--Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass steps into a booby-trapped tomb; American Arthur Demarest fights looters in the jungles of Cancuen; and in Chiapas, angry villagers kidnap Australian-born Peter Mathews. We also examine stories of past explorers who helped shape the \"Indiana Jones\" stereotype--paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews battled venomous snakes and Mongol bandits in the Gobi Desert; John Pendlebury, the British archaeologist, fought Nazis on Crete; and Sylvanus Morely, who was the first American archaeologist/spy. There are no special effects, no stuntmen, and no retakes...and for these real-life archaeologists, no guarantee they'll survive for a sequel.","popularity":0.1423,"poster_path":"/9a417vvN741BlIooTGQAShXzT7h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Tomb Hunters: Snakes, Curses and Booby Traps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Real Tomb Hunters - Snakes, Curses and Booby Traps","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1215566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Bernstein","original_name":"Josh Bernstein","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/hZcAlJvFDzGr8vcHKEboH2MXvy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Host and Narrator","credit_id":"67000966e4801491468529c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4980635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Ohrns","original_name":"Brandon Ohrns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Roy Chapman Andrews","credit_id":"670009859ebea19006f820b2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoffrey Madeja","original_name":"Geoffrey Madeja","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67000920c9a10d46ea7cd743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3325140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcy Marzuki","original_name":"Marcy Marzuki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700093a7830c1301e7cc811","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0841036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1472,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9a417vvN741BlIooTGQAShXzT7h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":980}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
