D.W. Young’s elegant and entertaining documentary, executive produced by Parker Posey, is a lively tour of New York’s book world, past and present, from the Park Avenue Armory’s annual Antiquarian Book Fair, where original editions can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars; to the Strand and Argosy book stores, still standing against all odds; to the beautifully crammed apartments of collectors and buyers. The film features a litany of special guests, including Fran Lebowitz, Susan Orlean, Gay Talese, and a community of dedicated book dealers who strongly believe in the wonder of the object and the everlasting importance of what’s inside.","popularity":0.3569,"poster_path":"/qGi8ZCxoy0z7yO4ByT5hAksmErK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackletter Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Booksellers","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":31,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Libreros de Nueva York","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parker Posey","original_name":"Parker Posey","popularity":2.7136,"profile_path":"/yoFt75JfGUqQ6EV8qN6fckQuElk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5ee8cc9c9715ae0021a85c75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":172175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fran Lebowitz","original_name":"Fran Lebowitz","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/ivFaoK9TTJAqXsEzHCEddKsw5Pq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ee8cca888bbe60022cdf8e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gay Talese","original_name":"Gay Talese","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/lHlFRrB9eCsqEwJAXnVTIy5OZvy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ee8ccb0fe6318001e9a4e6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Benne","original_name":"Susan Benne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ee8ccbafe6318001e9a4e77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":254374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bergman","original_name":"David Bergman","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ee8ccc388bbe60022cdf923","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
