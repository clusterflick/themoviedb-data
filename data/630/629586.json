On the mouldy facades of formerly magnificent buildings on the waterfront, wet laundry has been hanging for days, unwilling to dry. It is winter in Havana. Four people, four destinies in a unique city. Accompanied by magical images of picturesque architecture and nature, far removed from the advertisements promising romance, sun, beach, cigars and vintage nostalgia. The film offers insights into the reality of life of the idiosyncratic, socialist island state that is still under the embargo of the United States, to which the Cubans respond with solidarity and zest for life, with a clenched fist on the outstretched arm calling 'Viva la Revolución'.","popularity":0.0681,"poster_path":"/EtUB7pVpWR7sXWiQI2ISlm7G7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter in Havana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406309,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudia Pöchlauer","original_name":"Claudia Pöchlauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bdb22ea6b90014bf6c28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Größbauer","original_name":"Walter Größbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bd8e2ea6b90012bf69e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Größbauer","original_name":"Walter Größbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bd9dc6006d000f483641","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Scheidl","original_name":"Chris Scheidl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bdbb2ea6b90010bf6913","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Größbauer","original_name":"Walter Größbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bca0d19a33001011cce6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406312,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Istvan Pajor","original_name":"Istvan Pajor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bdcdc6006d000e483750","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Größbauer","original_name":"Walter Größbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bda6d19a33697e11a912","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406311,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yosvani Cruz Quevedo","original_name":"Yosvani Cruz Quevedo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74bdc4c6006d0011484178","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9381320","wikidata_id":"Q60617221","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/EtUB7pVpWR7sXWiQI2ISlm7G7a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
