Suddenly he makes his appearance, his game-bag full, of newspapers. He tells his friends that he actually disdains small game, and to illustrate the story of his wondrous adventures, turns the house topsy-turvy. His wife, alarmed, advises him to go to bed and calm his excited brain. Nightmares disturb his sleep. He finds himself in Africa, traveling on camel, accompanied by many guides. He arrives at an Arab's camp and jests with the Arabian maidens who, for revenge, put out his fires in the forest the following night. The fires out, the wild beasts arrive, and he just has time to climb a tree where he is out of reach of two big lions, who wait for him at the foot of the tree. Our great Hunter courageously risks his life by descending from the tree. He tries to strangle the lion, but suddenly awakens and finds himself clutching at his wife's throat.","popularity":0.1676,"poster_path":"/4SGCKZFcUZdCsKqqgFBGwB2QZzG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Française des Films Éclair","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1912-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gavroche rêve de grandes chasses","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Funnicus' Hunting Exploits","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bertho","original_name":"Paul Bertho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1EDRyblUIaGHqqi2Hjc9dsOiaGe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gavroche","credit_id":"5d74dbd8d19a3377d511e22f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Bosetti","original_name":"Romeo Bosetti","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/fcIANwE4rSLFdjhlcNVhf8PUkp9.jpg","credit_id":"5d74dbbdc6006d001248638a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0481730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4SGCKZFcUZdCsKqqgFBGwB2QZzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
