Their home is actually quite dilapidated. Yet the young man dreams that the house in Brzozowa Street is the centre of the universe. The unique narrative is enhanced by a surreal impression of living in an abandoned house. Olaf notices metaphysical consequences of living in the vicinity of a square shaped like the “eye of god”: “There are moments when my mind transcends time and space” he says.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/san2w1ITGGmy03cfERB68ROxi7T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye of God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Kawecki","original_name":"Igor Kawecki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7405953a4a1230f6d104a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10751550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/san2w1ITGGmy03cfERB68ROxi7T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
