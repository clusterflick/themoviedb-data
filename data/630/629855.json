But his neighbor demands some of the tree money as some leafs are hanging over his property. Edgar, on the tractor, ruins a warehouse, smashes a fire hydrant, wrecks a streetcar and tears up the concrete road pavement. Edgar is hauled to court and has to pay the damages. At home, when he yanks the tree out of the ground, it crashes down upon his car.","popularity":0.2899,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgar & Goliath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"5d75a25912970c000f9af327","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Lake","original_name":"Florence Lake","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/8gMkdeMDR0ZjhZavHLaQYsBm235.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Florence, Edgar's wife","credit_id":"5d75a26a5294e7000ff484a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Franey","original_name":"Billy Franey","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/k1NKW0GxaRTqpe6UOGWeDcnxXrR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pop, Florence's father","credit_id":"5d75a2765294e70011f48b60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank O'Connor","original_name":"Frank O'Connor","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":"/8ah94UFfqDRNvousj3doLVLYIYU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Buyer","credit_id":"5d75a2852ea6b90012c062ee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Rush","original_name":"Dick Rush","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"5d75a2945294e70011f48b97","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Blystone","original_name":"Stanley Blystone","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":"/9kYGxCZeyYJWTJuvpt7YFrZOx3Y.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Neighbor","credit_id":"5d75a2a22ea6b90013c05e02","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/oPBTBFXVdoQrkxfNB4Q3vyQvli9.jpg","credit_id":"5d75a2492ea6b90012c0628b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126277","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
