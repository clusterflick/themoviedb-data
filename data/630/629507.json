From the very first game there was high drama with the hosts suffering a surprise defeat to Greece. In Group B England looked to have defeated the French until the final minutes when the magic feet of Zidane scored not once but twice. Group C went down to the wire, Sweden and Denmark needed to draw 2-2 for both teams to make the Quarter Finals and put Italy out of the competition.  It couldn't possibly happen... but it did.  Group D was expected to be hotly contested and it produced arguably the best game of the tournament when the Czech Republic came back from two goals down to defeat the Dutch 3-2.","popularity":0.5123,"poster_path":"/3vP9eoQQFljWamL0elBAIM8k32B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Official Review of UEFA Euro 2004","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Euro 2004: The Official Review","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristiano Ronaldo","original_name":"Cristiano Ronaldo","popularity":1.3563,"profile_path":"/ty0FuQcOzl6ejhCqSiJcm1shRKy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d743a8e209f183b07fb747d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zinédine Zidane","original_name":"Zinédine Zidane","popularity":0.4864,"profile_path":"/vIctMCMyv50QUael45I4mFJGYuR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d756ae312970c00139ab179","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Rooney","original_name":"Wayne Rooney","popularity":0.2631,"profile_path":"/pIUmu6SkoZpF5wT96mx0cEtyv2N.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d756aec12970c00129aadfc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406134,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Downham","original_name":"Chris Downham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7437ad1277780011292e5e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406133,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Whittle","original_name":"Stuart Whittle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74379d1277780015292974","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1206,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4hSERlkrPUiboJZwFd2KSqX1MKr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2144}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3vP9eoQQFljWamL0elBAIM8k32B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1022},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1442,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/xudQWuiEmjtdUv4amsLGCB42RiM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1015}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
