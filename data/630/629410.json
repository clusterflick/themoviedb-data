Director Jason Ruscio expresses the profound loneliness of a decimated world through richly textured images that bring to mind the films of Andrei Tarkovsky â€“ burned out interiors, hands grasping to hold each other, time-worn photographs and faceless soldiers in the snow. ECLIPSE is a remarkable meditation on the effects of war.
