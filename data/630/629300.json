Krieger was unknowingly subjected at a young age to a state-supported systematic doping campaign that valued medal counts over the well-being of athletes. In the film, Krieger describes the often complicated effects of extensive doping on young athletes, and his subsequent long and painful search for gender identity. As a man, Krieger is now known as Andreas.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andreas Krieger: Heidi’s Farthest Throw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405550,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Florian Lehmann","original_name":"Florian Lehmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d73527f209f180014fbfd0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Schwartz","original_name":"Sven Schwartz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7352503a4a120014d1bd6a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405551,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominic Tetz","original_name":"Dominic Tetz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7352c01277780015284e84","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Schwartz","original_name":"Sven Schwartz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d73523912777800122854e0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Schwartz","original_name":"Sven Schwartz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7352041277780014284c48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
