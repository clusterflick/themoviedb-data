Medina is cast as female gambler Angela Medley, who is forced by circumstances to align herself with outlaw Slinger. But Angela has never gotten over her love for honest frontier doctor Bruce Merritt, and at the first opportunity she redeems herself by catching a bullet intended for the doc. Henry Hull delivers the film's most memorable performance as Angela's drunken wretch of a father. Per the title, Buckskin Lady affords the viewer ample opportunity to see Patricia Medina in form-fitting western garb.","popularity":1.4085,"poster_path":"/5fmUi7DHDB9mcC4cSRatV19KEOc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/4YldLvCWQL9VIAHQ2Fu3Ffkh9Si.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bishop-Hittleman Pictures Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Hell-Hot Story Of A Hell-Bent Dancehall Dame Who Climbed To The Top ...Bullet By Bullet ...Man By Man!","title":"The Buckskin Lady","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Medina","original_name":"Patricia Medina","popularity":0.4275,"profile_path":"/tH6zmMmVCj2pfnUSnTepEpyvc0B.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Angela Medley","credit_id":"52fe498bc3a368484e130d67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Denning","original_name":"Richard Denning","popularity":0.5001,"profile_path":"/xBDoxyNeRyi4uOvnH2OsmkvJQYi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Bruce Merritt","credit_id":"52fe498bc3a368484e130d71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Mohr","original_name":"Gerald Mohr","popularity":0.4703,"profile_path":"/jJx5f6K7OkDD2LcHZTPtYYd4T97.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Slinger","credit_id":"52fe498bc3a368484e130d75","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Hull","original_name":"Henry Hull","popularity":0.3414,"profile_path":"/6oCZSt4USguv8nut9hILiWpv2C.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. James Goldsboro ('Doc') Medley","credit_id":"52fe498bc3a368484e130d79","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Worden","original_name":"Hank Worden","popularity":0.3573,"profile_path":"/8GL5cWYfYuMFLpAH7oQxqDD6kcp.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lon","credit_id":"559140aa925141758800112e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Adams","original_name":"Dorothy Adams","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/tW5VJvit37Z5JTl7siUwvZ5SIgX.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Mrs. Adams","credit_id":"559140c99251417588001139","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Foulger","original_name":"Byron Foulger","popularity":0.6505,"profile_path":"/8j1Mn3alrcZyfe742LCfjCglQ3L.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Latham","credit_id":"5aa0438c0e0a2641e0017e60","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Sully","original_name":"Frank Sully","popularity":0.3257,"profile_path":"/m3t0i0di4jDYReiBeYa11OCf05r.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Jed","credit_id":"5aa043afc3a368152a014a9c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dierkes","original_name":"John Dierkes","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/4M9P2Tcu1bR6us0vrnmae6j6TdQ.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Swanson","credit_id":"64975a3162f335010818264f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Lettieri","original_name":"Louis Lettieri","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Ralphie","credit_id":"64975a4562f33500ca4343b6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Cisar","original_name":"George Cisar","popularity":0.2143,"profile_path":"/o7J4l7p4XBzqjaYtY1amnVm33uf.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Cranston","credit_id":"64975a55955c6501444d780c","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl K.
