A glamorous wife, two beautiful daughters and a well-paid job with a large bank. Then, one day, his entire world collapses. In the wake of a high-profile financial scandal, he is summoned into his director's office and accused of negligence. Rainier has no choice but to resign, but he soon realises that he has been made a scapegoat.
