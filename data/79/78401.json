She finds refuge in the apartment of some girlfriends who earn their living as prostitutes. Pia and Tom, a young German couple, have come to Morocco seeking musical inspiration. When they meet her in a nightclub, Amira's sensual dancing inspires the thought of a potential love triangle that might help stimulate Pia's stagnant relationship with Tom. Amira, with ulterior motives, embraces the idea of an affair with Tom, hoping this might provide an opportunity to change her fate.","popularity":0.2864,"poster_path":"/aJM7EBFxwKp9MFfM30xPskoOBxz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kasbah-Film
