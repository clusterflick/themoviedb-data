For years, he has sought distraction from his inner poverty through his relationships with women. In this movie, his marriage to an emotionally overwrought woman comes under strain when he hops into bed with a teen-aged adorer. However, this isn't the relationship his wife should worry about. The actor has a far more sinister relationship with a plain, hard-faced woman who expresses her deep contempt for the actor. The more she does so, the more he loves her; the more he loves her, the more contempt she shows. Eventually, he comes to see that these relationships are mirrors of his inner life -- which arouses him to despair, as he cannot bear to own up to this.","popularity":0.1528,"poster_path":"/l5f9phUuiQEn5yqyUZFOF9K9a76.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1992-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reflections in a Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Reflection in the Mirror","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Mirror Reflection","type":"World-wide"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le reflet dans le miroir","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Weerspiegelingen","type":"informal literal title"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Отражение в зеркале","type":"cyrilic"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Proskurin","original_name":"Виктор Проскурин","popularity":0.3886,"profile_path":"/fDqp9I7rMZwBtYutYAl1aRk6yXE.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"52fe498ec3a368484e1315a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniya Dobrovolskaya","original_name":"Евгения Добровольская","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/9oLYVsuTTJMJBqlx5VZGI6DZtca.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"5e27fa831685da0019e042c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1405838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inna Pivars","original_name":"Inna Pivars","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/5cpEgrWEGv8rYbxsgrzMNEJxsKb.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"","credit_id":"5e27fa972dda89001957ba14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ilin","original_name":"Владимир Ильин","popularity":0.4512,"profile_path":"/4DJwGRrm5VuZw5gLTJCbjCC36U7.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"","credit_id":"5e27faa7c68b6900173f2bb8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalija Baranova","original_name":"Natalya Baranova","popularity":0.0711,"profile_path":"/fT07CIQSoALREgox0gB6eqTOnDI.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"","credit_id":"5e27fab44ca676001a40d077","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Proskurina","original_name":"Светлана Проскурина","popularity":0.1342,"profile_path":"/6Tav6CKqS2B0aBpuDOhp5liA2dE.jpg","credit_id":"52fe498ec3a368484e13159f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2517520,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrej Tsjernych","original_name":"Andrej Tsjernych","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e27fad64ca676001740d654","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2517521,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vjatsjeslav Gaivaronski","original_name":"Vjatsjeslav Gaivaronski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e27fb0b1685da0017e07f93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dmitry Mass","original_name":"Dmitry Mass","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/wUsyMc4k8uq6ON1H3npG32dqQIh.jpg","credit_id":"5e27faf92dda89001957bc62","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0105072","wikidata_id":"Q4340028","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aL73nJQywQ44X4t5Hymql6msfoo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1362,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l5f9phUuiQEn5yqyUZFOF9K9a76.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":908},{"aspect_ratio":0.556,"height":1632,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2skLRjVTJajBzrqw9SzV4ryksVJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":908}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"1992-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
