He receives unconditional support from his friend Otti (Walo Luond), but that is about all; the other villagers do not tolerate Jakob's eccentricities very well, and regard him as a crackpot. He perserveres in spite of this obstacle and finally invents a viable carriage that does not run on wheels but on a tread. Unfortunately for Jakob, the military have already come up with the same invention: the tank. The discovery finally breaks him, and he is quickly shuttled off to an asylum.","popularity":0.203,"poster_path":"/142fTo1pTUaSVt8Zisv9NWBKp6Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inventor","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Ganz","original_name":"Bruno Ganz","popularity":0.648,"profile_path":"/8bhS1PObqe8OOVcyIRxV5Rcdufd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jakob Nüssli","credit_id":"5344aa100e0a267bd4000cbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walo Lüönd","original_name":"Walo Lüönd","popularity":0.1558,"profile_path":"/grXU7GTBbMZqTNgfR5P4cVYaK8k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Otti","credit_id":"5344aa180e0a267bc0000c58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verena Peter","original_name":"Verena Peter","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Martha Nüssli","credit_id":"5344aa280e0a267bc6000cb6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Diggelmann","original_name":"Oliver Diggelmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Seppli Nüssli","credit_id":"5344aa2e0e0a267bc9000c59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Knuth","original_name":"Klaus Knuth","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/s9ZdtOyglpr3eVVfhvB00pavK3g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Philipp Nüssli","credit_id":"548a0769c3a3686f5800238f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Kohlund","original_name":"Erwin Kohlund","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/rGYkjH873NcPnMsew7Iqu3BUoSN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fabrikant","credit_id":"548a077cc3a3686f58002391","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ettore Cella","original_name":"Ettore Cella","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Patron","credit_id":"5c81b28592514127661b946e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margrit Rainer","original_name":"Margrit Rainer","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/vVaXB7ON3YdAsrzLdDng3xDdbJZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herta","credit_id":"5c81b293c3a3684e89d71ea0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Scheibli","original_name":"René Scheibli","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ingenieur","credit_id":"5c81b2eb0e0a2643015f5ef7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gempart","original_name":"Michael Gempart","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/r6VggY2FEkiD2OLxEzYWYQnjKH1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Gerhard","credit_id":"5c81b2f9c3a3684e95d72d94","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Gnädinger","original_name":"Mathias Gnädinger","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Speculator","credit_id":"67a9b1c4b01153d6f493732a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babett Arens","original_name":"Babett Arens","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Lisbeth Nüssli","credit_id":"67a9b1df16b972753a060dcd","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inigo Gallo","original_name":"Inigo Gallo","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Viktor","credit_id":"67a9b1f0d12793743f93771c","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Gloor","original_name":"Kurt Gloor","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5344a9f70e0a267bd7000c27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Gloor","original_name":"Kurt Gloor","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9b081086f5483760f76e3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190831,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hansjörg Schneider","original_name":"Hansjörg Schneider","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9b0b61ca858ae11060ab7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303333,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonas C.
