Until he meets and instantly falls in love with fatherless semi-illiterate shop clerk and ditto-daughter Martine Pérez. As his overbearing father Robert feared, stripling hormones run wild at the expense of academic future-building, but paternal authority is overruled by 'young love', which even yields peer-acceptance. Cool big brother Christian, a photographer, tries a more understanding approach, but even that runs into trouble.","popularity":0.2921,"poster_path":"/7rsBLW3oIy4dhNmYk4n94ngzHJI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Amour en herbe","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Meynier","original_name":"Pascal Meynier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marc Morel","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e1365dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guilhaine Dubos","original_name":"Guilhaine Dubos","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Martine Pérez","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e1365e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Raffaelli","original_name":"Bruno Raffaelli","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/1yMD6BTvxSk0CjZ4jUr3SZMEkJQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Christian Morel","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e1365e5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxime Le Forestier","original_name":"Maxime Le Forestier","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/vSv3hhtUsHa21F2qKfnCmDK5tVh.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e1365d9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":199992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Andrieux","original_name":"Roger Andrieux","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e1365d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0074140","wikidata_id":"Q3201867","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7rsBLW3oIy4dhNmYk4n94ngzHJI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1977-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
