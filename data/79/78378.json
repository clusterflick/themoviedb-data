In the midst of the night stands Marie, a young prostitute, who has learned how to live in this shady environment. Marie's encounters with johns have many faces; notorious bon vivants, an old man who brings cake from his wife, and Count Albin, a lofty gentleman whose behavior is very strange. Before Marie sleeps with him, she must tie a blue band with white dots around her thigh. The next day she encounters the Count shopping with his twelve year old daughter, Anna. It's apparent that Anna who wears a blue band with white dots in her hair is afraid of her father. Marie is deeply touched by Anna's emotional state which provokes her curiosity about the child. As she investigates Anna's situation Marie's humanity is revealed. It's ironic that a girl, Anna, of noble origins finds a motherly role model in Marie the prostitute.","popularity":0.0638,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":134186,"logo_path":null,"name":"GRUPPE:filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2008-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How the prostitute Marie turns into a hero and saves little Anna from defilement by her father.","title":"Hurenkarussell","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Kaim","original_name":"Magdalena Kaim","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e13450d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Ludwig","original_name":"Walter Ludwig","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Graf Albin","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134511","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heike Kotsios","original_name":"Heike Kotsios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134515","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Makowski","original_name":"Maja Makowski","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/yN03ONQLmFmZzsjqmgchJFL2haf.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Grete","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134519","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Renhardt","original_name":"Christine Renhardt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Kitty","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e13451d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannes Liebmann","original_name":"Hannes Liebmann","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Fahrgast","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134521","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Lieder","original_name":"Günther Lieder","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Freier mit Kuchen","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134525","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elke Pusl","original_name":"Elke Pusl","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Dora","credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134529","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bettina Hutterer","original_name":"Bettina Hutterer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134509","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cajetan Jacob","original_name":"Cajetan Jacob","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499bc3a368484e134503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1266572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":516,"name":"child abuse"},{"id":13059,"name":"prostitution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
