There are rumors of an imminent coup d’état, and the most visible exponents fear being arrested before dawn. One of them is Pino Masi, a singer-songwriter who wrote the hit “La ballata del Pinelli.” He invites two high school students, Renzo Lulli and Fabio Gismondi, to flee Italy with him, and the three set off. A series of misunderstandings ensues, starting with an unnerving encounter with soldiers on their way to Rome for the national holiday the next day.","popularity":0.3165,"poster_path":"/mNiklDxGIULTSPBWhDwuSS4yFSQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7699,"logo_path":"/fHasfMWVRXGOmao2p1ijwicv9f4.png","name":"Palomar","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":15130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urania
