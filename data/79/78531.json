But what is remembered today as being the ultimate political defeat of the American Century may also have been its high watermark. The film poses this central question: what does the crushing electoral defeat of a man so well respected for his decency and intellect say about the electoral process, the American government, and more importantly, what does it say about the forces at work on the American people- then and now? Featuring interviews with the candidate himself, supporters and activists like Gore Vidal, Gloria Steinem, Warren Beatty, Howard Zinn, and music from Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Donovan, and Elvis Costello.","popularity":0.5531,"poster_path":"/e0V8B9nUH8oOlgys9VivJPAwg9U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Street Legal Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-16","revenue":15504,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For once in American politics, sunshine and light beat shadows and fog.","title":"One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George McGovern","original_name":"George McGovern","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/9YEDCZa8hh2n9mV59wlbT1TI4Cf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cf2db9b0e0a261973cb8d6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Beatty","original_name":"Warren Beatty","popularity":1.0214,"profile_path":"/4IDilrr21iRKv75QOwNKJPC3WgW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e13636d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Abourezk","original_name":"James Abourezk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e136369","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chip Berlet","original_name":"Chip Berlet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e136371","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Mankiewicz","original_name":"Frank Mankiewicz","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ef03fdcbd55b661fd90d4d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11626,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gore Vidal","original_name":"Gore Vidal","popularity":0.427,"profile_path":"/vHIIjpltpM9StRYmjjM7liAObuZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ef040baa77e08af7991ca1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":219851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Goodman","original_name":"Amy Goodman","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/3i3Nbn44KmsEwaqYZno56BUgbD1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ef041dcbd55b661fd90d54","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Hart","original_name":"Gary Hart","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/pPFLiqQtvDB6zSsuk6M88moJ0Y2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ef044cb3e035286cd92106","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227966,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Vittoria","original_name":"Stephen Vittoria","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a368484e13635f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227966,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Vittoria","original_name":"Stephen Vittoria","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49a6c3a368484e136365","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0468528","wikidata_id":"Q7092500","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AiVsgWuoaqEb2FdMQQQbfXulzZr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e0V8B9nUH8oOlgys9VivJPAwg9U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xpLq10aNsfsGWNa1uNGuKBYfcej.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ncQlwwvZ676NlhnMSkUFgGxBBnn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
