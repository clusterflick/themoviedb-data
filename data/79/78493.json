Her life changes when she auditions for a TV show called \"Gotta Be Happy\". To her astonishment, she is chosen, and her mission is to throw a surprise party for her parents on the upcoming show. However, there is a price to pay for all this: she has to let the viewers into her private inner world and share with them an event that has been overshadowing her family's life and hers for the past 22 years; an event that made a tight-knit bunch of friends shun her parents, Chaya and Yitzhak Levine.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":"/7GjMYSZ6NpA2MEnlMZHdgSJHwKU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2005-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Muchrachim Lehiyot Same'ach","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigalit Fuchs","original_name":"Sigalit Fuchs","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Simcha (Joy)","credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tal Friedman","original_name":"Tal Friedman","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/ytp8ykWwLkrYOwubZz50ka9v8Zl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gil","credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keren Mor","original_name":"קרן מור","popularity":0.3242,"profile_path":"/kB05N0kscsiGS0BEqH4YVEU4GmA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nora","credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":306116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michal Yannai","original_name":"Michal Yannai","popularity":0.3013,"profile_path":"/a4LoRhv64c2DND3nk1rgnBQZpPy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tamara","credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c2f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rivka Michaeli","original_name":"Rivka Michaeli","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/12U4h3m5wBj9sUi4rD7aKil2EMX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Haya","credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c33","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154825,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Omer Tadmor","original_name":"Omer Tadmor","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c39","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Shles","original_name":"Julie Shles","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49a3c3a368484e135c1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0480690","wikidata_id":"Q6967957","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/7GjMYSZ6NpA2MEnlMZHdgSJHwKU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
