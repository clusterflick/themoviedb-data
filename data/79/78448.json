One evening, Léo strikes up an acquaintance with a woman taxi driver, Cora; in spite of her impulsive and moody temperament, he cannot help being attracted to her. On the spur of the moment, Cora invites Léo to make love to her. When Bony meets Cora, he too finds her irresistible, but he lacks Léo’s self-confidence to make his move. Cora is not a woman that any man can possess readily. She is like a wild animal, a creature that revels in its freedom. Will either Léo or Bony be able to tame her...?","popularity":0.1801,"poster_path":"/hnRjeHdhmVEzL36ibJdnZxRSxbl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films
