The 1964 Cuban/Soviet coproduction marked a watershed moment of cultural collaboration between two nations. Yet the film never found a mass audience, languishing for decades until its reintroduction as a \"classic\" in the 1990s. Vicente Ferraz explores the strange history of this cinematic tour de force, and the deeper meaning for those who participated in its creation.","popularity":0.3412,"poster_path":"/fqlghiH4JbDUJovlUfo8pl4UaOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Três Mundos
