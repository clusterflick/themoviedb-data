She tells him he looks normal, but she's sorry, she doesn't have time to have coffee with him.  When he convincingly protests that he was not following her, she apologizes and asks him to have coffee.  Fontaine would seem to have a relatively good life. She works as an anesthetist at a fancy mental hospital, and she's got a live-in Nobel Prize-winning arctic scientist boyfriend, Michel, who seems to love her.  But there's clearly something nagging at her. She walks around in a perpetually distracted state, and frequently mistakes other peoples' identities and their intentions.  When Michel proposes to her, she needs some time to digest it before she responds.","popularity":0.5705,"poster_path":"/9qsLl9mUAcjf722uysvuJEuuCcb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gentille","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Good
