Though McGonagall's solicitations are rejected by the Queen, it doesn't stop the turgid prose, and pathos, from overflowing as McGonagall hilariously attempts to become the greatest poet in the land. The image of the bad poet, trapped by his romanticism and inspired by a muse with a tin ear, appealed mightily to Spike Milligan, and this cult British spoof features the Goons show maestro at his ridiculous, genre-defying best.","popularity":1.066,"poster_path":"/nBcFqPNnmMzotaMqjalPBDz4iTn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
