When they stake all they have on a new milk-shake bar things begin to look up and the local film studios even want a girl to play a leading part that's just up Mille's street. But mum suddenly dies, leaving Mille deep in debt to her evil auntie and cousin, who'd rather be rid of Mille once and for all. Luckily heaven sends a couple of angels and Topper, a good fairy.","popularity":0.4355,"poster_path":"/sapltWJOq9uIOmj9xHcA6vAA2En.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regner Grasten Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2003-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinder Rock'n Rella","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Askepop - The movie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofie Lassen-Kahlke","original_name":"Sofie Lassen-Kahlke","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/ggYHKzNaYUabxdidBmiai6gnyVL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mille","credit_id":"52fe49a2c3a368484e13584b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Bille","original_name":"Karl Bille","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/iLtPanOqIwAhfjSiHdon81ghsbz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Topper","credit_id":"52fe49a2c3a368484e13584f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Prip","original_name":"Henrik Prip","popularity":0.3248,"profile_path":"/z9ppJpTJWZqAuWZyQFyTz96pKJl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gabriel","credit_id":"52fe49a2c3a368484e135853","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Lohmann","original_name":"Lars Lohmann","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/AqpaUxsOeEjTFTJ5fEGrYn1vuGW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Volle","credit_id":"52fe49a2c3a368484e135857","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joachim Knop","original_name":"Joachim Knop","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":"/xDWIa9SthKBS8YBSZgh3sOvvWej.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"52fe49a2c3a368484e13585b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pernille Schrøder","original_name":"Pernille Schrøder","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/pdFcnY3QD6e5Ti9c6QIA3sJ41UR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"624098a8c50ad2005cd1401d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Oliver Hansen","original_name":"Peter Oliver Hansen","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/pTY1fYcXJ23liKwSfayco6p8Xr9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"624098b6dd83fa004ac3999e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1741884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bente Eskesen","original_name":"Bente Eskesen","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/aiZrImAVNaCXk4sE0ZlCc0Dq8Rk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"624098c4c616ac0047801f33","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":357119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xenia Lach-Nielsen","original_name":"Xenia Lach-Nielsen","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/qTLdZmrQVTd4cthMIuobhU0sjg8.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"624098cfd7f4650049cfc2a6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claus Bue","original_name":"Claus Bue","popularity":0.1351,"profile_path":"/4Fs6UdZFkqEI4ERoEYsGIHeT77J.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"624098dd4cbe120091fe387b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian K.
