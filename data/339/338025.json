We see the tale through the eyes of a modern young girl, the oldest child in a large rural Tex-Mex family. During a surrealistic dream, which brings to mind \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the young chicana makes a fantastical journey with the shepherds and along the way; witnesses the triumph of God's Angels over Satan's diablo's. Full of drama, comedy, fantasy and wonderful music; this is a rare film the whole family can enjoy together.","popularity":2.2605,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richard Soto Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":52416,"logo_path":null,"name":"El
