In Mexico, a stripper dances night after night to keep a roof over her child’s head. In Canada, a woman becomes a mother for the first time after enduring seven miscarriages. Finnish filmmaker Joonas Berghäll has travelled to South African settlements, Nepalese terraced fields and Russia’s metropolis Moscow to investigate an unshakable and almost magical connection: the bond between mother and child. MOTHER‘S WISH portrays 10 women from the most varied of cultural and social backgrounds who all tell of the beauty and difficulty of being a mother. These are not only stories of love and pride – but also of disappointed hopes and the most precarious of life circumstances. Above all else, however, the protagonists tell of their determination – regardless of their current living conditions – to fight for a better future.","popularity":0.3076,"poster_path":"/hqJLJhwf2j0BRC6xw0md5Dn09lW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52708,"logo_path":null,"name":"House of Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":17598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mantaray Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":7079,"logo_path":"/m4er9bvkoHHgELav4HPgMDlq3MP.png","name":"Oktober","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"2015-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""},{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Wish","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235503,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joonas Berghäll","original_name":"Joonas Berghäll","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/lq5DsqUjwgJ80ZCklV8tvnGcJv7.jpg","credit_id":"55486d0dc3a368788c001330","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1936533,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Plouffe","original_name":"Simon Plouffe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4USHbGFrZ2YNh5h8PBriJXUUAgl.jpg","credit_id":"61995ba7af58cb00666a6bb3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798280,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johan A.
