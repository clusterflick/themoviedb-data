On the basis of archive material, documents left behind by her great-aunt Ro Miller and stories told by her father Eli Asser, Hella de Jonge reconstructs what happened to her family during, before and after the war. How they became aware of the danger, how they fled, how they hid, how they survived and how they died. And how, after the war was over, it continued to weigh on their lives. In Hella’s words, “The doctor advised my mother to have children, to help cope with the incredible loss.” A portrait of her grandmother, who died in the war, still hangs in her father’s living room. The filmmaker’s relationship with him has always been difficult. Fragments of memory never before discussed run together during an emotional journey embarked upon together by father and daughter to places of significance in the history of their family.","popularity":0.1127,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Lose Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462308,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert-Jan Stips","original_name":"Robert-Jan Stips","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5545bdaf9251415865005eb0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hella de Jonge","original_name":"Hella de Jonge","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5ZNkN3hvy3251PoXvMqiZgcTRcG.jpg","credit_id":"5545bd699251413fc0002eb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462307,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Schuurman","original_name":"Paul Schuurman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5545bd9b925141586d005bd6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freek de Jonge","original_name":"Freek de Jonge","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/xdYTIjpd700ueqvsyECdbJHttav.jpg","credit_id":"5beaee8d0e0a263bf3056fa0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4311478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":4399,"name":"victim"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Verlies niet de Moed (Trailer)","key":"mdOv4fELL9c","published_at":"2015-03-02T15:12:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5545c044c3a36856e500312c"}]}}}
