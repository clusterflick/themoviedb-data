We hear South and North Vietnamese, including émigrés to the United States, describing how huge numbers of friends met their deaths, caught as they were between government forces, the Vietcong, and the Americans; how political boundaries divided not only the country, but also families; how mothers deserted their children because their fathers were American soldiers; and how the war cruelly lingers on long after hostilities ceased, in the lives of children born crippled by chemical weapons.","popularity":0.1921,"poster_path":"/6Jwhrtk7txUhe2o2weF0HH5mLXL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"War is Bad","title":"The Face of the Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Pauser","original_name":"Erik Pauser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5567039d925141477b00169a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Pauser","original_name":"Erik Pauser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"556703b9925141477d001853","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2157033","wikidata_id":"Q14955213","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iaSaNoKdlMfUVm4T5O23PJ11tfy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1480},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l5VHjKqrSI1JdzRFUIt5xosyNv1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Jwhrtk7txUhe2o2weF0HH5mLXL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":832}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"},{"id":2956,"name":"vietnam"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
