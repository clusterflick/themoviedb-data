Kim, Kalle and Johan have invited their friends, Lisa, Åsa and Stina to the large decayed apartment in the factory, to play \"The spirit of the glass\". The guys are planning to scare the girls with the story of the janitor who brutally murdered his wife a few years back. But when the game starts something goes wrong.
