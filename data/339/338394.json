When Marvin finally asks Josie on a date, she discovers that Marvin has built a television screen saver that blocks all commercial breaks, live or in rerun. Seeing an opportunity for both of them, Josie suggests that they team together to sell his invention. But first, she must get him fired from the company. Her idea is to have him pretend to sexually harass her. Then, away from the company, and over a reasonable amount of time in a secluded location, he will pretend to invent the apparatus he's already invented. The problem is, in order to steal the invention away from the rightful company, they must lie to the company, lie to his parents, and lie to her friend. In a beautiful lake cabin she rented for their adventure, they await the results of their larceny. Unfortunately, reality catches up with them in more ways than one.","popularity":0.3955,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A romanitic comedy about life, love, lies and lacerny.","title":"Jack and Jill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jack & Jill","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Bohman","original_name":"Dan Bohman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Kevin Willert","credit_id":"55454d20c3a3680cd7005070","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cary Bolling","original_name":"Cary Bolling","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dick Lederman","credit_id":"55454d33c3a36856e500211c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Hlubik","original_name":"Jesse Hlubik","popularity":0.1364,"profile_path":"/rG9TjkyoWHFmFeRNcT2NodnHNA3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"55454d41c3a3680cd9004d95","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Grant","original_name":"Jennifer Grant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jill","credit_id":"5ba5743fc3a368089a0001d9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Grant Olson","original_name":"Grant Olson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55454d7bc3a3680ce6005022","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Sivertson","original_name":"Chris Sivertson","popularity":0.2509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55454d8e92514140a10020bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Grant Olson","original_name":"Grant Olson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55454d70c3a3680ce8004dc3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1340586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3338,"name":"invention"},{"id":11454,"name":"scam"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
