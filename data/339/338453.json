First attaining popularity with the legendary Doobie Brothers, McDonald has gone on to be a guest performer on recordings with many acclaimed artists such as Steely Dan, Quincy Jones, Patti LaBelle, Kenny Loggins, and many others. On this live performance, broadcast by the BBC in July 2003, he is reunited with fellow Doobie Brothers Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons as they perform such Doobie classics as \"What a Fool Believes,\" \"Blackwater,\" and \"Taking it to the Streets,\" as well as McDonald's solo hits; the performance is highlighted by the guest appearance of Valerie Simpson and Nickolas Ashford, the visionary husband and wife songwriting team.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael McDonald Live in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
