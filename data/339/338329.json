The djinn are believed to be supernatural creatures that occupy a parallel world to ours and their emergence is associated with sexuality, political unrest, poverty and mental illness. The taboo subject of demonic possession remains broadly unresolved in the hearts and minds of some Muslims due to its complex and uncomfortable nature. Using a subjective, “undercover” style, Al Kury journeys into the obscure world of exorcists and the possessed, confronting their traditions and rituals. It makes for a telling ghost story that bares the filmmaker’s and her society’s subconscious underbelly.","popularity":1.4558,"poster_path":"/zU1rPu06XnP7x2fb3pBz7WJDN9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lichtblick Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Possessed by Djinn","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Bessessen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Besessen von Dschinn","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1462124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dalia Al Kury","original_name":"Dalia Al Kury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5544d592925141499f00072b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7085284","wikidata_id":"Q24562497","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7L3ZlXlt7Sa0Xnah9rF9tNlltB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zU1rPu06XnP7x2fb3pBz7WJDN9T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6156,"name":"superstition"},{"id":3684,"name":"religion and supernatural"},{"id":9792,"name":"djinn"},{"id":10114,"name":"evil spirit"},{"id":68646,"name":"supernatural creature"},{"id":195240,"name":"investigative journalism"},{"id":212776,"name":"fighting supernatural"},{"id":215277,"name":"arab culture"},{"id":262040,"name":"beliefs"},{"id":272408,"name":"evil spirits"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
