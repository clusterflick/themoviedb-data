However, the good stuff collected here is very good, both in terms of performance (Tom Petty snarling \"American Girl\", a pre-irony U2 whooping up \"I Will Follow\") and historical interest, notably a shockingly youthful Elton John crooning \"Tiny Dancer.\"","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Grey Whistle Test Vol 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
