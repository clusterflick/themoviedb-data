Leonard Grey was a troubled seventeen-year-old who one day went on a shooting spree, injuring several students at his high school and killing one before he took his own life. A reporter for the Los Angeles Times is assigned to research and write an investigative piece about Grey. The journalist studies interviews conducted by the police with the boy's friends and family as well as conducting several of her own as she tries to understand what turned a seemingly ordinary youngster into a killer. She finds an especially intriguing subject in Cameron Porter, Leonard's best friend, who may have been involved in the shootings though he carefully refuses to incriminate himself.","popularity":1.19,"poster_path":"/8AqMaDN5XQOLCuITZb9PmQ3x3VM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67016,"logo_path":null,"name":"James Bruce Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Case 219","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melora Walters","original_name":"Melora Walters","popularity":1.0997,"profile_path":"/FSxiDBekrKgmzow1j3UhmNHOhI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Victoria Lash","credit_id":"563895099251416d52010d35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":207401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leven Rambin","original_name":"Leven Rambin","popularity":1.0749,"profile_path":"/vjXXg3QCtFIxvLl1Aa0fTHFhA3d.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Carla Evans","credit_id":"563895299251413b13000e0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Perrineau","original_name":"Harold Perrineau","popularity":2.1007,"profile_path":"/bVSLpGUaislREbujmknOqadrxYM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Franklyn Bonner","credit_id":"56389534925141728c000744","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Ross","original_name":"Evan Ross","popularity":0.3321,"profile_path":"/95rr0S5zC6csxoZdFAvv4Wzo4gg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cameron Porter","credit_id":"563895409251414ab701d2a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Davern","original_name":"Brett Davern","popularity":0.28,"profile_path":"/a2WEosnrvpGbdOu45bFa3T5UQg2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Leonard Gray","credit_id":"5638954a925141285701eff8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Nichols","original_name":"Taylor Nichols","popularity":0.6517,"profile_path":"/2VnYWsBXx19tNvBX1diwfjdLkjU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Richard Ewing","credit_id":"56389554c3a3681b4d021d3c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Smyka","original_name":"Natalie Smyka","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/cJYgeROFyd3lK4hPtwFdkcMKvPn.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Student","credit_id":"56389560925141728c00074f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Nielsen","original_name":"John Nielsen","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/u5lz4fe5jDgvobEch0YtdQvujo6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Det.
