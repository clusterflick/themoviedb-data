At that time, the region was covered in snow for months, and in addition to the many problems brought about by the coup, it was impossible to find coal. Coal was a blessing that only privileged people and some state institutions could access. Serhat, Gürbüz and İbo, three close friends, start looking for coal instead of playing games during the report card holiday following the coup. Their struggle for heating, one of their most basic needs, will turn into a story of solidarity that will shape their childhood.","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":"/hMu2tO5T7ApVmyXWM2U7M9ugdeM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2015-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow Pirates","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Snow Pirates","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yakup Özgür Kurtaal","original_name":"Yakup Özgür Kurtaal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Gürbüz","credit_id":"55430218c3a3680ce3000f37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ömer Uluç","original_name":"Ömer Uluç","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ibo","credit_id":"554302309251415868000f03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taha Tegin Özdemir","original_name":"Taha Tegin Özdemir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Serhat","credit_id":"55430248925141586f000f1a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Faruk Hacihafizoglu","original_name":"Faruk Hacihafizoglu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554302689251410e84000996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Faruk Hacihafizoglu","original_name":"Faruk Hacihafizoglu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554302889251415868000f16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3259424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2yMDMRqdHetYtRoycuojMfttfnY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1346,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/hMu2tO5T7ApVmyXWM2U7M9ugdeM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":950},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/zGdg5D7T0pp8s410bK6oMSLjSK7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
