It pivots mainly around music, leaving software and movies completely in the dark. Main themes evolve around the judicial debate, but why not tackle this from a more philosophical (moral for instance) or cultural point of view ? Also from a technological point of view it declines to bring any interesting revelations. And what up with the disgusting musac layered all the time into the interviews ? It completely turns your attention away from the subject and gives you the impression of watching some cheap promotional video you might encounter on a late night tell-sell channel.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Piracy: On Piracy & the Future of Media","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien McArdle","original_name":"Julien McArdle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7bb9492514155380005d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0818688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
