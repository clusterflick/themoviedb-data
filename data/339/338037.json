When Jan is invited to a party at the Savoy, she meets dashing young Tony Ward Black mad about jive, owner of a Bentley, and supposedly running through a legacy. Attracted to the daring young man, she rejects Mark, a young farmer who is in love with her.

danger.","popularity":1.0853,"poster_path":"/gQZY3BDbU6obKdzwSFpW2H8bJcP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":632,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Lion
