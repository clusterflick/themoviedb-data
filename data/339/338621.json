About six scenes from The Mikado are shown, then designer Charles Rickets steps onto the stage with a final look at the costumes and the film ends. The players in the production are legendary Savoyards, well-known from recordings of the period, but this is the only time a movie camera caught them in their roles, though sadly minus the singing. About four nitrate prints of this film are known to exist; two of which are at the BFI in London.","popularity":0.1067,"poster_path":"/gCj2n9wwJoPziEaM54avvgj3poB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1926-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mikado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darrell Fancourt","original_name":"Darrell Fancourt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"The Mikado","credit_id":"55468fce925141114900015c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Goulding","original_name":"Charles Goulding","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nanki-Poo","credit_id":"55468fe2c3a368573b0044ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Lytton","original_name":"Henry Lytton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ko-Ko","credit_id":"55468ff0c3a368573b0044d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Sheffield","original_name":"Leo Sheffield","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pooh-Bah","credit_id":"55468ffe9251411889000648","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Huntington","original_name":"John Huntington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pish-Tush","credit_id":"5546900ac3a36816bf00047c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Griffin","original_name":"Elsie Griffin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Yum-Yum","credit_id":"55469017c3a3680ce800732e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aileen Davies","original_name":"Aileen Davies","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pitti-Sing","credit_id":"55469024925141114900016e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Elburn","original_name":"Beatrice Elburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Peep-Bo","credit_id":"55469034925141178b0005f3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1462642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertha Lewis","original_name":"Bertha Lewis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Katisha","credit_id":"554690409251411149000175","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ricketts","original_name":"Charles Ricketts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"55469049c3a3680cdb007622","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":43856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Adair","original_name":"Janet Adair","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"554690549251413fc00043d7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Aitken","original_name":"Herbert Aitken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"55469065c3a368573b0044e5","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Ashley","original_name":"Josephine Ashley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5546906ec3a3680ce8007339","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Avona","original_name":"Marjorie Avona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5546907d9251413fc00043dd","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Blain","original_name":"Henry Blain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5546908a9251413fc00043e5","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.S.
