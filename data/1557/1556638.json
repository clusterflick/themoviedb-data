He decides to be a designer of graphic signs. He fills communist Poland with his works and defines the country’s visual landscape. His signs do not hang in galleries, but are present in Polish homes, in Polish streets, at institutions and workplaces. At the same time, he leads an ordinary family life, which he documents passionately over the years. This extremely gifted artist is still considered one of the greatest sign designers in the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2025-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Signs of Mr. Plum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karol Śliwka","original_name":"Karol Śliwka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68e02904c1995174f68e677a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Urszula Morga","original_name":"Urszula Morga","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e0290fc17f5faa30cef4a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611639,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bartosz Mikołajczyk","original_name":"Bartosz Mikołajczyk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e02919ec6131e532189170","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
