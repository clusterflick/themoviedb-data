Aivar also wants to be part of the group of guys looking for the airplane. To do this, he needs to pass a test - walk along the pier to the old fort and carve his name on the wall. On the way back, he is caught in a storm, but he passes the ordeal with honor. An old sailor Yoran, who lives on the decommissioned ship \"Izabella\", helps the guys in their search for the airplane.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vJRHnbTk9TwMvTE4UmzBwYkEY2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82801,"logo_path":"/8h6Ugz5S1DiX7kaeg19eQKXsS4q.png","name":"Rīgas kinostudija","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aivars","credit_id":"68deaad8197155b298da588b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5724915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ēriks Mironovičs","original_name":"Ēriks Mironovičs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Valters","credit_id":"68deac36df3914de19fd22f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5724916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ēriks Kalniņš","original_name":"Ēriks Kalniņš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ģirts","credit_id":"68deac4f8d881ef825f741f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2208949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miervaldis Ozolins","original_name":"Miervaldis Ozoliņš","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/xPg9Gpz8w7dfVZixkVcxEUfVmWg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"maestro","credit_id":"68deaaa01e18012c23da5898","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5724917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Breže","original_name":"Andris Breže","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Vladiks","credit_id":"68deac58654405a8d9991b0d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2913588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edvīns Avots","original_name":"Edvīns Avots","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ervīns","credit_id":"68deac611a11b7411eda597c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karlis Sebris","original_name":"Karlis Sebris","popularity":0.1827,"profile_path":"/jV8DNUT9iER91GyYVCG86nM00PT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jorēns","credit_id":"68deaa94f6d338daccda58a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martins Verdins","original_name":"Mārtiņš Vērdiņš","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/5JAC7cxgDoRTckxND86VYlaHGSE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"zvejnieks","credit_id":"68deac9adf3914de19fd2309","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Varis Brasla","original_name":"Varis Brasla","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/3O2syhKlbkpvUzvX9ppW14XEgkN.jpg","credit_id":"68dead05d873c4ba216a7983","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2400302,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jānis Lūsis","original_name":"Jānis Lūsis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dead14d873c4ba216a7986","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1389907,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Romualds Grīnblats","original_name":"Romualds Grīnblats","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dg5EP2LTjweuzfOw2fYPtfBm0ta.jpg","credit_id":"68dead242ce589d9f6405edd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906127,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uģis Egle","original_name":"Uģis Egle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dead2c0df446f64b405ebe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2395397","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/vJRHnbTk9TwMvTE4UmzBwYkEY2q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
