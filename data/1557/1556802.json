She deflects the conversation, insisting a solution to his crisis of meaning could be to join the dating applications. Heartbroken, Randall follows Sarah’s advice, but this casual and dishonest way of life begins to have dehumanising effects on his mind and body. Without Sarah, however, Randall can’t find it in himself to stop, as he doubles down on the descent into ratty madness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Full-Time Love Rat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
