Marcia, a former late-night show starlet known for her eccentricity and unpredictability, embarks on a journey around the world, hosting a travel show. While the concept sounds promising, it's a big demotion and lacks substance for her. Deep down though, she knows this is her only chance to show off her skills and get back to her dream job. Through the eyes and voice of her new boyfriend, Arnold, we witness a tumultuous and ever-evolving example of what it takes to find love in 2025. There is eccentric humor, grounded drama, and tons of the unexpected in this new partnership, as they travel from Amsterdam to Istanbul, through the islands of Greece, to French wine country, and Lisbon, Portugal to finally end up not only in Cape Town, South Africa but to remote safari locations in the African Savannah.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An American Abroad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35685119","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
