He does so with an analog camera, stores the rolls for years, and develops them randomly. He archives the negatives and, some time later, rediscovers those images. Under a philosophy that prioritizes the emotional experience of looking, Franco builds, over time, an intimate cartography of his own gaze and, at the same time, a visual memory of his city. Pequeños ojos rescues his artistic process and reveals the essence of who is, perhaps, the greatest exponent of everyday life photography in Córdoba in Argentina.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2PSqCS1ho3WlXrxJJEllyl4jaSo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pequeños ojos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Franco","original_name":"Guillermo Franco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68df29ad81570d0c899727b6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433724,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ezequiel Salinas","original_name":"Ezequiel Salinas","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/wYby4kMRhrrzh0DOGno0n7M4vss.jpg","credit_id":"68df2a390e536bdb922a181d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Apontes","original_name":"Ana Apontes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df2a4c76dba065bd2a186d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2665447,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Atilio Sánchez","original_name":"Atilio Sánchez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df2a5f08b2e59ef29727ad","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740818,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucía Torres Minoldo","original_name":"Lucía Torres Minoldo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df2a6f688f64009f2a1858","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriela San Martín","original_name":"Gabriela San Martín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df2a80f63aa73f892a17d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2847,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/2PSqCS1ho3WlXrxJJEllyl4jaSo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1997}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
