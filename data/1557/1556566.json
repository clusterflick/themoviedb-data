Juxtaposing the futile restoration of decayed 8mm circus footage from the 1950s against a guerrilla recording of a German cultural institution discussing restrictions on a queer film festival in Bangalore, the film critiques how institutions police radical art. The larger part of the film is an hour-long recording of drones over Gaza. The zanana often acts as both surveillance and psychological warfare against civilians. These drones, manufactured in Germany, is a reminder of the complicity of Western nations in sustaining violence while silencing dissent. Engaging with the ethics of creating and consuming cinema within compromised spaces, the film holds a mirror to the fragility of institutions that posture as radical while evading accountability.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masturbation is easy, finding the video is hard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
