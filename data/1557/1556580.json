The Choir of King's College, Cambridge celebrates these anniversaries with the first classical album ever to use Dolby’s new Atmos technology, which uses ceiling-mounted speakers to reproduce the acoustics of the Chapel with unprecedented realism. This recording pays homage to one of the most influential musicians of the Venetian Renaissance from within one of the great buildings of the English Renaissance. As well as being principal organist at St Mark’s Basilica, Gabrieli was a prolific composer of sacred vocal and instrumental music. The Choir is joined by His Majestys Sagbutts & Cornetts playing faithful recreations of instruments from Gabrieli’s time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1615 Gabrieli in Venice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4569141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Cleobury","original_name":"Stephen Cleobury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/orDnc0B9RsrsfaJr3fyHwzsZxdI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor (self)","credit_id":"68e00e54d6826a90098e661c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choir of King's College, Cambridge","original_name":"Choir of King's College, Cambridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gMjZBCxFjf5A8TaELvknK0QJjIp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Choir (self)","credit_id":"68e00e7020796cc751cef445","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"His Majesty's Sagbutts & Cornetts (HMSC)","original_name":"His Majesty's Sagbutts & Cornetts (HMSC)","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/w8UvaUokMh3IobSCT5Xo6TssFp4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Early Music Ensemble (self)","credit_id":"68e00f3d985346504e08e93a","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.271,"height":1573,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3wOJbP9rVRtWdwdzKZkdcBa1o46.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
