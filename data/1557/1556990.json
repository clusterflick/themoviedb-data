When his doorbell breaks, he shoots a mirror to summon his valet. On a walk, he shoots down a window that drops on a man’s head, lights a cigarette in front of an oncoming car, and hijacks a cab at gunpoint. At a hotel, he breaks dishes, tips a waiter who spills soup on him, and leaves wearing another guest’s coat. Even when stabbed by robbers, he calmly removes the dagger and hands it to a policeman. Returning home, he shoots open his door, but his composure is finally tested by mosquitoes. His valet catches and powders each insect, astonishing his otherwise unflappable master.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un monsieur flegmatique","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1820735","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
