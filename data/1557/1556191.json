In a decade drenched in blood, confusion, and paranoia, a new serial killer lurks beneath the neon shadows, ripping bodies apart. And what was once America’s glittering playground has now become a neon-lit graveyard, paralyzed with horror. But this isn’t your average homicidal psychopath. This one walks, talks, and sings like an angel... but behind his mask lies an unholy hunger that is nowhere near being fulfilled.\r VAMPIRE ELVIS is a vile, carnal, grim, and seductive grindhouse relic, coming from the darkest corner of hypnagogic nightmares. A bizarre love letter to cult cinema, where rock 'n' roll rots, icons collapse, and desire outweighs reason.\r You’ve never seen a vampire film like this. And you sure as hell ain’t seen HIM like this.\r So turn the lights low. Lock the door. And whatever you do... don’t let HIM in!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":264676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Otis Patterson Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":276127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cult Classic Circus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"For God's sake, don't let him in!","title":"Vampire Elvis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5492645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel de Sa","original_name":"Gabriel de Sa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sun6Z0Dgf9aC6CtM48EX9l5zcsL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vampire Elvis","credit_id":"68df07de22ecf931003b8a8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5492675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hudson T. da Silva","original_name":"Hudson T. da Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2g320exW0Mq51TVyzumEVAsSxa0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frankie","credit_id":"68df07e8bb92d37f0e9727ea","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"},{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":11532,"name":"grindhouse"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":12339,"name":"slasher"},{"id":12565,"name":"psychological thriller"},{"id":14570,"name":"las vegas"},{"id":315058,"name":"horror"},{"id":359772,"name":"elvis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
