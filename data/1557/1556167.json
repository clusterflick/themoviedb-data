Upon completing her resettlement program at Hanawon, she is placed in a public housing unit in Nowon, Seoul. Yet, life in the South feels like an uncharted world. Choosing to enroll in a South Korean high school rather than extend her stay at Hanawon, she soon finds herself struggling—both academically and culturally. Her only wish is to reunite with her family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eLtXmwTZFSqFylDMnuUB8CPlKD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150162,"logo_path":"/i8c7lSvpQZG5HuaiONFriaYcRJj.png","name":"ChungKang College of Cultural Industries","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2025-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Poet of the River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Han Jung-kook","original_name":"Han Jung-kook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee657b5c5ce2d662e431c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Han Jung-kook","original_name":"Han Jung-kook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee661a2ff1fef662a43da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Han Jung-kook","original_name":"Han Jung-kook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee667bd7c6920132a43e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Han Jung-kook","original_name":"Han Jung-kook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee66c80692cf75bee4bea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Hae-ri","original_name":"Yang Hae-ri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee681b5c5ce2d662e432d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725287,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeong Yong-hyeon","original_name":"Jeong Yong-hyeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee69efac566fdeb5b8359","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725287,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeong Yong-hyeon","original_name":"Jeong Yong-hyeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dee6ab552ead67fe5b8372","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1248,"iso_3166_1":"KR","iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/eLtXmwTZFSqFylDMnuUB8CPlKD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":881}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Festival of Red Cross and Health Films","release_date":"2025-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mapo, Seoul","release_date":"2025-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
