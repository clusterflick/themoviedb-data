Here, man's strong belief in the universal philosophy of karma lies close to the incompatibility between its beliefs and righteousness. The symbiotic relationship between man and nature paves way to complicated traditions and belief systems. It portrays how contradictions of the human mind towards the same thing in two different situations creates artefacts of curiosity within a nature that seems out of place in a man-made world.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":600,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Human-Animal conflict","title":"Bolus","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
