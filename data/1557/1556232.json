This film follows his daughter, Colleen, as she returns home to the iconic Northwoods of Minnesota to help her aging father save his remarkable legacy.  Many in America have a paralysing fear of bears, yet, as a child, Colleen was raised among wild bears, never questioning her father’s unconventional bond with these animals. Now, a frail father and loving daughter face denial, heartache, and the looming threat of hunters while Lynn strives to see his favourite bear, ‘Lily,’ one last time.  Set against the raw beauty of the American wilderness and brought to life with rare, unseen archive footage, Bearwalker charts the fifty-year journey of a controversial scientific pioneer, revealing how challenging and overcoming fear can create a new relationship with the wild.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18944,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Factual Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":191680,"logo_path":"/cXZ488vNAwKk0PWkp9TwHkcvNi5.png","name":"Oak Island Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":148677,"logo_path":"/6rrziISL6yVm6lxz0lfIOrV5BwD.png","name":"Merit Motion Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":132503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passion Planet","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":276129,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wish Tree Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bearwatcher","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Rogers","original_name":"Lynn Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68df071a0e536bdb922a178c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5725488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Rogers","original_name":"Colleen Rogers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68df076ef658bb6ad73b8a0f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675065,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Lown","original_name":"Peter Lown","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df079f9a542855aa3b8a4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3793064,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jack Bootle","original_name":"Jack Bootle","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df0836b41db9a781ee4cba","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Merit Jensen-Carr","original_name":"Merit Jensen-Carr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df084b5cc9d882014c655b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Allen","original_name":"David Allen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df08700e14cc58a29727c9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Oakes","original_name":"Ted Oakes","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df087e22ecf931003b8a93","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2144129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Watt-Smith","original_name":"Tom Watt-Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68df0897a58a36687b2e4381","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
