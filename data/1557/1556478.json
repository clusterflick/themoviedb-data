But there are strong similarities to a play he is acting in. As Zain’s interrogation plays out over 18 tense minutes, the line between fiction and reality blurs, and he slowly realizes that everything he does is being watched, leaving him to wonder who is truly watching. The film takes an abstract approach to themes of censorship and erasure, deliberately avoiding specific names, places, or historical events. Zain’s story unfolds within a surreal, theatrical realm, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in its emotional and political currents, untethered from any fixed time or geography - and to question whether he is concealing or revealing the truth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You've Seen It on TV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4969365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rimah Jabr","original_name":"Rimah Jabr","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dfdd49e4ab0232da2a1c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
