It tells the story of addiction's impact on children, and the lonely world it creates.  It highlights the gulf of difference between the heaviness of home life with an addict and the freedom of just being a kid. It’s also about a girl’s relationship with nature and how a big Iowa sky can hold you when you have no where else to go.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nEgtd1PXiu2r3D64HzinflrrThV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oldest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meara Wallace","original_name":"Meara Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"68e09c7175986ec77636da1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristian Day","original_name":"Kristian Day","popularity":0.187,"profile_path":"/ajFRaRIcOw7qoeIuFKrPBdL2Bbn.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"68e09c7a76040052a9c21b46","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie McDonald","original_name":"Frankie McDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Melanie","credit_id":"68e09c92e0751e69abc21afe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathlin McCullough","original_name":"Cathlin McCullough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e09afca69ef94b4225a84e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathlin McCullough","original_name":"Cathlin McCullough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e09b0f9afe809112bd8afd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mel Guérison","original_name":"Mel Guérison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e09b3bd15acdbbb09ca0c0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905829,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruce James Bales","original_name":"Bruce James Bales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e09b73ae18fef684c21b2a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristian Day","original_name":"Kristian Day","popularity":0.187,"profile_path":"/ajFRaRIcOw7qoeIuFKrPBdL2Bbn.jpg","credit_id":"68e09b80cccbc41ace960b2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030179,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leah R.
