Shot in 2019 in Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Morocco, the EU, UK, and US, Immuto features stories of crisis and action told by compelling changemakers living and working on the frontlines. More than just compelling stories, however, these agents of change address viewers directly, calling for the mutual recognition and solidarity required for our varied yet interrelated struggles to safeguard our planetâ€™s biodiversity, adapt to the rapid changes, demand climate justice, and draw down carbon.
