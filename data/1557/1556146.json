Comprising a vegetable garden, an ornamental garden, a copse and two ponds, it is a space in constant flux, but also a visual melting pot that invites cinematic exploration. The film was shot as a tribute to the creators of this beautiful place, Annick Bertrand-Gillen and Yves Gillen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aMRB20ntH4ZjeFYhgMVW6EOmsmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jardin du Marais","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1286993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rose Lowder","original_name":"Rose Lowder","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/iRDL93tiLU9Sp5SANiMG8wGug6.jpg","credit_id":"68dedcef9cf42eeb7efd24eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":2560,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/aMRB20ntH4ZjeFYhgMVW6EOmsmi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
