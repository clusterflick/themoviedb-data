Julia attends a class on the Lebanese Civil War, where her professor tells a story about his experience as a foreign journalist covering the war. Having been sheltered from this reality her entire life, Julia is moved by the stories he tells and the images he shows. She is struck by one image in particular, that of a woman who seems so familiar to her. She seeks answers from her professor, who seems startled by her line of questioning, and evades answering her all together. Determined to get an answer, Julia returns home to continue her search, looking through old documents and photos, awaiting her grandfatherâ€™s return. Once home from his evening stroll, for the first time in her life, Julia reaches out and asks about his past in Lebanon and finally learns of the fate of her grandmother.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between the Silence and the Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5726655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Balkis","original_name":"Sara Balkis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dfdca52ed3bb95e34c686a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
