The broadcast had to be delayed for an hour while a crew of 85 people from the video music channel fixed the many things that a prior storm had knocked over or ruined. Among the things damaged included a bank of telephones which tipped over; a canvas covering the stage which had ripped away, and a soundboard which had to be replaced. The concert happened as a result of a national, annual concert put on by the music channel and won by Bulls Head residents Stephen and Linda Geraci. And, once the concert was underway, the crowd got in the cosmic, good-time spirit the band is known for and danced with enthusiasm. The band told the Advance they'd played Staten Island early in their career, nearly 20 years and 20 million album sales ago, and were glad to be back.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/trw8Zi3LrjMMSoMy6awzXo9PAND.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10692,"logo_path":"/qFS7NEIS3fiBW1wi6VMAcwAsFCX.png","name":"VH1","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VH1 Big Backyard BBQ with the B52's","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2YWdq274hfcfNwEuQIABjAdWxTQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/trw8Zi3LrjMMSoMy6awzXo9PAND.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
