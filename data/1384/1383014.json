The narrative walks viewers through the considerations and efforts behind building a heavy cruiser. It then details examples - such as leaving paint, books, towels and posters unsecured - presented potential risks in an emergency scenario. It shows how the cumulative effect of these mistakes impaired the fighting efficiency of the fictional cruiser \"HMS Andromeda\", turning minor battle damage into a critical situation - and preventing the cruiser from moving to intercept an enemy vessel.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143773,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Admiralty","origin_country":""},{"id":2650,"logo_path":"/sDWe94w5fuyfgfRKc3N27CSJvsD.png","name":"Ealing Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1944-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship Safety: A Story of Seven Sailors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9693988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1944-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
