Today, with this film, the images of Waco Foundation responds to Dr. King’s challenge by tracing our heritage- from the Waco Indians and the Spanish Conquistadors, through the frontier days of the Chisholm Trail, to the suspension bridge and the founding of our colleges and universities- to show how the quality of life Wacoans currently enjoy emerges from a complex tapestry woven from the dreams and efforts of our forebears. The breathtaking images of Waco captured in this evocative film challenge us to acknowledge and appreciate the qualities of today’s Waco and build on our glorious heritage to create an even better community for our children.","popularity":0.2702,"poster_path":"/lE0HZUb5O3b4cuQsRSe7uOCSyKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Images of Waco Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Images of Waco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Shaw","original_name":"Bill Shaw","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"672a7b36a8d9f9a0bc56ea5e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Stewart","original_name":"Alan Stewart","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672a76e6599da289809538ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Stewart","original_name":"Alan Stewart","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672a7db806dc8859632426e6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53133,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damon Crump","original_name":"Damon Crump","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672a7e5aa8d9f9a0bc56ead1","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lE0HZUb5O3b4cuQsRSe7uOCSyKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9914,"name":"slice of life"},{"id":235200,"name":"waco texas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
