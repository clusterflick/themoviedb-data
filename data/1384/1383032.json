Through the protagonist's point of view we will investigate the very delicate bond between mother/son/foster family, never losing sight of the child's emotional priorities. Letting ourselves be carried away by her voice over, we will find ourselves inside her reality; in the everyday life of a village in a timeless Sicily. We will walk those streets alongside her, surprising ourselves to find within that story so many other little stories laden with prejudice and backbiting against the village prostitute.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":"/xJc9iBNVPkG5JncGZ2wBkzBDT02.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accura Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Loosely based on the short story “Nothing Ever” by Alessandro Savona.","title":"Assunta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatella Finocchiaro","original_name":"Donatella Finocchiaro","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/zAcHyOB6O3vN0hKs8PwxOyw2Ngd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6729eb25599da28980952234","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Pandolfo","original_name":"Antonio Pandolfo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/o4ShOnABX7RQf58XTgwpPa050Kz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6729eba90ce6d14a409eab8c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mattia Libeccio","original_name":"Mattia Libeccio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6729ebb1eb0fdd9cd84b1f9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2094251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Di Chiara","original_name":"Bruno Di Chiara","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/2QXyG0pD36g85iJ1GxDzqlP9erA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6729ebb7eb0fdd9cd84b1f9f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luana Rondinelli","original_name":"Luana Rondinelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729eb3642bec49877803fcf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luana Rondinelli","original_name":"Luana Rondinelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729eb3d42bec49877803fd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375133,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Teresi","original_name":"Francesco Teresi","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ebcd0ce6d14a409eab9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422737,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniele Savi","original_name":"Daniele Savi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ebd950e15e8f5a5815fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2217301,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giuliana Sarli","original_name":"Giuliana Sarli","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ebe4a8d9f9a0bc56d755","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4921569,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Dora Argento","original_name":"Dora Argento","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ebf4a8d9f9a0bc56d759","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gregorio Caimi","original_name":"Gregorio Caimi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ec06eb0fdd9cd84b1fb3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/xJc9iBNVPkG5JncGZ2wBkzBDT02.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
