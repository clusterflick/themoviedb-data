But was it truly silent? Then sound came along and changed the way we see, understand and create images. A true lesson in philosophical and aesthetic cinema freely conducted by the director, Clichés et ramasse-miettes invites us to rediscover our relationship with sound and our conception of the vraisemblance of sound, through fragments taken from works by Henri-Cartier Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman and others. An essential film to appreciate Claude Beaugrand's artistic vision.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/nCbXdzbA1C7OYlvzxHTF1y5muVK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clichés et ramasse-miettes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Beaugrand","original_name":"Claude Beaugrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672a3df950e15e8f5a582554","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nCbXdzbA1C7OYlvzxHTF1y5muVK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
