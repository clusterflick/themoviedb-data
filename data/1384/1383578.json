Most nurses perform patient care in the home under the direction of the patient's primary care physician, the nurse often acting as the intermediary between the doctor and the patient's care-giving friends and family who must take over such duties when the nurses are not on duty. Many mothers are familiar with their services as they are on site during at-home pregnancies, and perform pre- and post-partum care to any mother and child in the home as required. The responsibilities of the nurses often make them think quick on their feet as their duties sometimes involve emergencies and often in an environment without a full stock of standard medical equipment.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1945-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Victorian Order of Nurses for Canada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colette Dufault","original_name":"Colette Dufault","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"672b5e7c50e15e8f5a5846ec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Wilkinson","original_name":"Douglas Wilkinson","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672b5e5650e15e8f5a5846d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15843932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1945-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
