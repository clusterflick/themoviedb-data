John Dorr’s Seasons Greetings, the latest in a series of video letters that John sent to his friends each year. (…) Although I’ve never seen John’s other Christmas cards, his latest delivery is clearly different from those that preceded it, in that he knew he was ill when he made it. It begins with a short statement to the camera about living with AIDS, which serves as a prologue to a series of vignettes recorded during trips he made last year with companion George La Fleur. »  Bill Krohn, « John Dorr’s New Year’s Greetings », Cahiers du cinéma, n°470, Nov. 1993","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/vi6OyqXlgCDp3MnFUsAJvVtzuyQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"John Dorr’s New Year’s greetings","title":"Season's Greetings","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dorr","original_name":"John Dorr","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/tsajYN9t8P0VhMo9Ioe5DBbtZgA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Dorr","credit_id":"672ae9a383e62f05c6b59d1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2378912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George LaFleur","original_name":"George LaFleur","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xgpZGtmwhVS9y7bLVJpnDWiE543.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George LaFleur","credit_id":"672aeca883e62f05c6b59da0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dorr","original_name":"John Dorr","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/tsajYN9t8P0VhMo9Ioe5DBbtZgA.jpg","credit_id":"67a350a4a224d2999c811192","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1535,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vi6OyqXlgCDp3MnFUsAJvVtzuyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1023}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
