Opponents, hostages and frantic patriots were imprisoned there, and many were often tortured. Only the name Grini itself spread fear and horror among good Norwegians during the period. In the Liberation Day, a documentary film was made to show you the life at Grini after peace finally came to Norway, and to reveal the German's assault on the prisoners.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norsk Film","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1945-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grini - Frigjøringsdagene den 8. og 9. mai 1945","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bjarne Jullum","original_name":"Bjarne Jullum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672b2037433c82ea267e8ec0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Lütcherath","original_name":"Fritz Lütcherath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Reader","credit_id":"672b2047898d18e69095c3c8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290138,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Olav Engebretsen","original_name":"Olav Engebretsen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672b20194b30e929cd6ed937","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10383170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"1945-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
