Although she disapproves, George's wife, Lisa, insists on being his \"silent partner\" with a fifty percent share of the profits. Lisa avoids spending lavishly and saves her share of the money. Later, Ralph, who is in love with Lisa, conspires with brokers Jim Harker and Charles Nesbit to involve George in a stock deal that will likely ruin his business and his marriage. George loses his fortune and leaves his wife. Ralph conspires with his friend, Gertie Page, to lure Lisa on a voyage to Europe. Soon after boarding the ship, Lisa learns of the plot and disembarks. She reunites with George and assures him that they are not destitute.
