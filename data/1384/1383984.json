Les Jours Sauvages takes us to the rhythm of a logbook in a quest where friendships are invented and put to the test of commitment, where time expands and spirits fly away.  Hélias, Alex, Christophe and Aurel all live in Chamonix. This cradle of world mountaineering and expert skiing is their daily playground. They have all participated in long, difficult expeditions at high altitude. They have bivouacked on the face or gotten lost on gigantic Himalayan glaciers, dug an igloo to shelter from storms. Waiting, doubts, giving up, and success are stages and feelings that they know and whose lessons they know how to appreciate. They are also full of willpower, strength, spirit and good humor.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/aVYPgcuFL0iq1LLvXlqKYe8Xvzk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169966,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Endroit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélias Millerioux","original_name":"Hélias Millerioux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"672c8bea898d18e69095f4c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Marchesseau","original_name":"Alexandre Marchesseau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"672c8c0c1e8dcec4a62ba1ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4481848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurélien Lardy","original_name":"Aurélien Lardy","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"672c8c2c914bae94a1bba51f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Tricou","original_name":"Christophe Tricou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"672c8c3c898d18e69095f509","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yohan Guignard","original_name":"Yohan Guignard","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672c8c6d898d18e69095f531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yohan Guignard","original_name":"Yohan Guignard","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672c8e87599da289809566a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Marchesseau","original_name":"Alexandre Marchesseau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672c8e9c5a20459207414284","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Clouzeau","original_name":"Hugo Clouzeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cafbe914bae94a1bba8fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Moreno","original_name":"Igor Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cb02b42bec4987780a3c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045313,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ismaël Benazzouz","original_name":"Ismaël Benazzouz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cb0b1914bae94a1bba97d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3772082,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pascal Barneville","original_name":"Pascal Barneville","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cc72126b605bc19e5c949","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q3aTjrs8aecvMCEuyoENvHBGLCf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVYPgcuFL0iq1LLvXlqKYe8Xvzk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
