In 1976 Wishbone Ash were at the zenith of their career. Their albums, from \"Pilgrimage\" to \"New England\", reached worldwide top positions in the album charts, were refined with silver and gold, the band was constantly on tour around the globe and tracks like \"The King Will Come\", \"Warrior\" or \"Blowing Free\" achieved cult status among fans of guitar-oriented progressive rock and are milestones in rock history. Characteristic of Wishbone Ash is their melodic, guitar-oriented rock, which is dominated by two electric guitars played in duet. In addition there is an almost ballad-like vocal style. This Rockpalast edition is a must for every Wishbone Ash fan!","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/iz8OyGDDLlHeDsTYAxlEjo0YcYy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wishbone Ash Live At Rockpalast 1976 Remastered","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wavVtJaPLBCPoW1Rsn3Qx0Rqqcv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bIyxDfSR9NwJwAC9pRrSoWzIJjG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1508}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iz8OyGDDLlHeDsTYAxlEjo0YcYy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2195,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o9LL5wyzg3mc33jMAv7IpOk4CQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1465}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
