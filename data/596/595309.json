In her peripheral roles in Kubrick’s and Antonioni’s films—which became iconic moments for the films she is invisible in plain sight, barely even credited. In Edmond T. Gréville’s lurid Beat Girl, she plays the title rôle and ironically enjoys not only name recognition but vastly greater agency.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gillian Hills Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
