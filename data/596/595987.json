When she passed at the age of 92, her death was a surprise to me, which I was not prepared for.\r The cinema has the immense power of creating the illusion of life and its protection. This film is my attempt to rescue my grandma from death. It is not a documentary about my grandma but a film with my grandma. I wanted to film a ghost and then return it to the realm of the living, like Orfeu tried with Eurídice. It is a route to resurrection. It is my way of giving her immortality which I deem to be her right.»","popularity":0.1913,"poster_path":"/7uej00pUkvlXN0e1zAKneHkmHhv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16701,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICA","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Minha Avó Trelotótó","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catarina Ruivo","original_name":"Catarina Ruivo","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb8ee1292514108d1f85389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catarina Ruivo","original_name":"Catarina Ruivo","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb8ee30c3a3682160808ddc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catarina Ruivo","original_name":"Catarina Ruivo","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb8ee200e0a266ba2f1e617","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"António Pedro Figueiredo","original_name":"António Pedro Figueiredo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f08bfb2e10f460039387691","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"António Pedro Figueiredo","original_name":"António Pedro Figueiredo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f08bfa71d1bf40037674e62","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10153626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uej00pUkvlXN0e1zAKneHkmHhv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":162846,"name":"ghost"},{"id":164039,"name":"grandmother"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"IndieLisboa","release_date":"2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
