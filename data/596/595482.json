The lamb was crucified against a white fabric-covered wall, with the entrails removed and displayed below a white table, splashed with blood and hot water.  Currently his work is often discussed in the context of our cultures fixation with violence seen on the news, movie screens, and in popular video games. Correlations have also been drawn to many instances of the intersection of violence and culture. These performance works, which have become known as \"actions\" have become more and more elaborate over the years.","popularity":0.1113,"poster_path":"/uHuWxpeROwxzwYsUsRk2Rbyljiy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Orgien Mysterien Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Nitsch","original_name":"Hermann Nitsch","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb5b8df92514108cbf3c6f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n4qhkR2WUA5rIIgDfQSYXJAPQEo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1074},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uHuWxpeROwxzwYsUsRk2Rbyljiy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
