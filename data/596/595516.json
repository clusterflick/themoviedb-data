The opera partly reflects the story of Joan of Arc and is based on a play  by Friedrich von Schiller, although claimed by the librettist to be \"an entirely original Italian drama.\"  If the thought of Anna Netrebko strutting her stuff in a suit of armour and tin hat sets your factor tingling then this is a must. It's an inconsistent opera but has some quite wonderful music along the way. The rest of the cast is good and the production won't offend either. Get it for Ms Netrebko's incredible performance alone.","popularity":0.4036,"poster_path":"/3wnBKRF1eX13oDFrUfdbPnzzg41.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teatro alla Scala: Joan of Arc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Giovanna d'Arco; ossia, la pulzella d'Orléans","type":"Original title of the opera"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":459782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Netrebko","original_name":"Anna Netrebko","popularity":0.9234,"profile_path":"/2SdYMHksZoKwMDllc8C2rhLmXX6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giovanna","credit_id":"5cb5f18ec3a3686b0781dd75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Meli","original_name":"Francesco Meli","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/1lnXvITG0C1CPUHPvQ3Om9StJnp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carlo VII","credit_id":"5cb5f19cc3a3686b0781dd7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Álvarez","original_name":"Carlos Álvarez","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/dJy0BIYUBe7IoTg8LHftLnewNA3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giacomo","credit_id":"5cb5f1adc3a3681b0d8145e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Beloselskiy","original_name":"Dmitry Beloselskiy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/48EdjcB3jPlQ1D2ytVr1uapDSP7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Talbot","credit_id":"5dafbfb01cac8c00150d2cf2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2438805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Mauro","original_name":"Michele Mauro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Delil","credit_id":"5dafc0021cac8c00150d2d76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Chailly","original_name":"Riccardo Chailly","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/lIA0VTcCG1wgGAKwVbPi3t9TYOc.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dafc037ecaef5001124203f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestra della Scala","original_name":"Orchestra della Scala","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffabf1f66ae4d003e0ff52b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice Caurier","original_name":"Patrice Caurier","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafbe94ecaef50013242481","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383476,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Temistocle Solera","original_name":"Temistocle Solera","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafbeab1cac8c00150d2a7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moshe Leiser","original_name":"Moshe Leiser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafbe75ecaef500172439c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5dafbec909dda40011e01f50","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vwb0fiLA25A2OFvq2VGQaO7ryds.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1208,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3wnBKRF1eX13oDFrUfdbPnzzg41.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":805}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":248047,"name":"giuseppe verdi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
