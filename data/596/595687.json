Outside at the birdfeeders, birds follow basic routines. As the sun rises and moves across the sky, life passes for all. The film uses a combination of stop motion and time lapse to record. This creates a visual staccato effect, which is also very apparent in the audio track when the two people are talking. Using this technique only small intermittent bits of a conversation are recorded. Much of the talking is omitted leaving newly constructed sentences and meanings.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/w9yjV8yPuM5YLbQsg9H0fD2WwDa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bird Feeders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb6e9f80e0a266b90eeb5ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3258220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w9yjV8yPuM5YLbQsg9H0fD2WwDa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1235}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
