Throughout his life, Simondon was studied by some prominent thinkers (among them Gilles Deleuze) but still his singular philosophy remained rather unacknowledged. Since then, however, his work has been widely circulated around the globe, and has even gone beyond the field of philosophy, having a great resonance within many disciplines, recently including the fields of media and visual culture.","popularity":0.0806,"poster_path":"/mVevqHweCeBeZvOmffULwaez932.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simondon of the Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Lagarde","original_name":"François Lagarde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fa741a6c10400f761ecc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Chabot","original_name":"Pascal Chabot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb35c4f9251411ed6219c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mVevqHweCeBeZvOmffULwaez932.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
