A few years ago, the fish farm—the island’s main economic resource and the only company offering the possibility of a job—went bankrupt. Then the government closed the secondary school. The archipelago’s population went from 70 to about 20 inhabitants… Julie Powis Arthur is one of the women who remained. Her husband, then her eldest son, had to leave their house for the Mainland and only rarely come back.","popularity":0.0903,"poster_path":"/j4NASmlhyksLcMm3JdkTmY0h16V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vaarheim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laetitia Douanne","original_name":"Laetitia Douanne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58f5a0e0a266b93ecc973","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Ridley","original_name":"Victor Ridley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58ebcc3a3686b04815e03","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240986,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kinan Massarani","original_name":"Kinan Massarani","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58efcc3a3686b07815d1e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289614,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathieu Storms","original_name":"Mathieu Storms","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58ed8c3a3686aee815f16","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Ridley","original_name":"Victor Ridley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58ec692514108d5f3914b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289616,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gilles Lacroix","original_name":"Gilles Lacroix","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58f3d92514108d3f39e02","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Ridley","original_name":"Victor Ridley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58ea80e0a266b9becb6e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carol Van Hemelrijck","original_name":"Carol Van Hemelrijck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58fc20e0a266b98eccce6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289621,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sebastien Lamoureux","original_name":"Sebastien Lamoureux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58f8c92514108d5f39269","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289624,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeanne Scahaise","original_name":"Jeanne Scahaise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58fde92514108dbf39392","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721591,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christophe Evrard","original_name":"Christophe Evrard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb58fa692514108dbf39352","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1528,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j4NASmlhyksLcMm3JdkTmY0h16V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1019}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Vaarheim | Victor Ridley","key":"yJrFBSFVBeU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-12T12:23:20.000Z","id":"5cb5900a0e0a266b98eccdad"}]}}}
