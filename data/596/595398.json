In the process of this intense relationship, she notices some disconcerting signs in her grandmother: Alzheimer’s is slowing her down. A new film begins, a tougher one: the story of a couple that must face a tremendous challenge. Struggling against the tide of oblivion, the task of filmmaking becomes the ultimate act of resistance. Trying to retain the last images of her grandparents, an intimate conversation begins and echoes through the songs that play on the radio, conjuring lost stories and memories.","popularity":0.504,"poster_path":"/lpu2JBPeHR1q3rHY6yqUYR17vFU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184355,"logo_path":"/zM5VRTYm17O5WhKH54UAmJNltpJ.png","name":"Dérives","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passing Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Freres","original_name":"Julie Freres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6Luw4SJUyqKsLEEmFDaDYuBmZ8b.jpg","credit_id":"667d3f4bfa1741c767fe1b13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4809933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benoît Declerck","original_name":"Benoît Declerck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668651f13b570ca7d522f54c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3583361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Ferrando","original_name":"Thomas Ferrando","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668652083dae3918c21b7017","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4806564,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Benjamin Dontaine","original_name":"Benjamin Dontaine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686521fc2ccf9784f2596c5","department":"Camera","job":"Digital Imaging Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Colpé","original_name":"Lou Colpé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668653ce962facde62905869","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Colpé","original_name":"Lou Colpé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb57bb20e0a266b96eca00d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Colpé","original_name":"Lou Colpé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb57bcb92514108d8f37aaa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2194854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nicolas Rumpl","original_name":"Nicolas Rumpl","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb57bdb92514108d1f37861","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289561,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tessa Namias","original_name":"Tessa Namias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb57bf892514108d1f37881","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OeConWjkMUUGlFjNp4RM0K0d66.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1602}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":990,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lpu2JBPeHR1q3rHY6yqUYR17vFU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5903,"name":"alzheimer's disease"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":40895,"name":"illness"},{"id":298930,"name":"old age"},{"id":299723,"name":"end of life"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Passing time (Le temps long) Trailer VOSTEN","key":"319700124","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-26T09:46:32.000Z","id":"668653ab0abec7407025960e"}]}}}
