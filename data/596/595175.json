Young rebels of 1960s – nonconformists, hippies and beatniks – have turned into a generation of well-known writers, poets, musicians, directors, as well as politicians of the new independent Latvia. The ones who were 18, 20, or 25 in 1960s are half a century older today. The protagonists  of  the  film  are  united  by  the  bohemian  gathering  place  of  their  youth,  a  small  nameless cafe in the Old Town of Riga, commonly referred to as “Kaza” (The Goat). This place is surrounded by legends, myths and humorous stories.","popularity":0.3352,"poster_path":"/mixY0oe2L8mwokHIZVsx5bXJ8Ip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They found their own freedom.","title":"The Goat Who Climbed to Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1754158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laima Žurgina","original_name":"Laima Žurgina","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/pBEopbOkOA10WcsNqKxroKqkMBH.jpg","credit_id":"5cb42f670e0a2626caca313c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kaspars Braķis","original_name":"Kaspars Braķis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2da2beb79c2003e4483e9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906127,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uģis Egle","original_name":"Uģis Egle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2da3fe640d6003ea6c049","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906126,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edgars Bite","original_name":"Edgars Bite","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2da14c616ac003bd55c02","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uldis Jancis","original_name":"Uldis Jancis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2da58c616ac003ed50c5a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480677,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Imants Kalniņš","original_name":"Imants Kalniņš","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/qbVnPjudPVew5u53ENrhnUlEIBL.jpg","credit_id":"5fe2da9d70309f003f7ebb57","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1754158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laima Žurgina","original_name":"Laima Žurgina","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/pBEopbOkOA10WcsNqKxroKqkMBH.jpg","credit_id":"5fe2dacfeb79c2003f4458c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906136,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miks Meirāns","original_name":"Miks Meirāns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2da760d417e003d4cb513","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881438,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andris Zemītis","original_name":"Andris Zemītis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2da89a0b6b50040123959","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guntis Trekteris","original_name":"Guntis Trekteris","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2dab5160e73003ea7605f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1754158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laima Žurgina","original_name":"Laima Žurgina","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/pBEopbOkOA10WcsNqKxroKqkMBH.jpg","credit_id":"6010a59c8ee49c003f661313","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10183728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mixY0oe2L8mwokHIZVsx5bXJ8Ip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":2113,"name":"iron curtain"},{"id":208992,"name":"1960s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kaza kāpa debesīs - treileris","key":"330720481","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-17T16:20:20.000Z","id":"6010a767ccde040040262cad"}]}}}
