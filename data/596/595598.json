In Japan, there are craftspeople who go far beyond this to reach a special kind of mastery. These people are called Takumi and they devote 60,000 hours to their craft. That's 8 hours a day, 240 days a year, for over 30 years. It's an almost superhuman level of dedication to a life of repetition and no shortcuts. This film asks the question: Will human craft disappear as artificial intelligence reaches beyond our limits?","popularity":1.2732,"poster_path":"/kZkiFcElIMe9ev4Agw9Q1XmXYPV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73620,"logo_path":"/kQQbILUGiewlKlkK2WeYdLZ61Sm.png","name":"Saville Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Takumi: A 60,000 Hour Story on the Survival of Human Craft","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Atkinson","original_name":"Nora Atkinson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cb64b860e0a266b98edd6fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Bruner","original_name":"Jon Bruner","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb64b900e0a266ba2ede378","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Ford","original_name":"Martin Ford","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb64b9bc3a3686aeb825d24","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shigeo Kiuchi","original_name":"Shigeo Kiuchi","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb64ba592514108d5f48897","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahoko Kojima","original_name":"Nahoko Kojima","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cb64bb00e0a266b98edd72f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil MacGregor","original_name":"Neil MacGregor","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5cb64bbb0e0a266ba4edcd47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hisato Nakahigashi","original_name":"Hisato Nakahigashi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb64bc50e0a266ba4edcd5d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsuaki Suganuma","original_name":"Katsuaki Suganuma","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb64bd5c3a3686af2827663","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2290043,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Miller","original_name":"James Miller","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb64c420e0a266b9fede458","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Bedwood","original_name":"Dave Bedwood","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb64bfe0e0a266ba2ede40c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290045,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"J.
