It is a highway for the mysterious migration of the Pacific salmon. The river shallows appear red with the flailing fish as they push up-river to spawn and die. A natural wonder puzzling to the scientist, the fish migration of spring and summer provides renewed activity for fishermen and cannery workers.","popularity":0.0932,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Runs the Fraser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57293,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Sydney Newman","original_name":"Sydney Newman","popularity":0.212,"profile_path":"/QKW3Widw7yaemYlB3NKEmJrhrF.jpg","credit_id":"66623cca1fe5ede4ff75fe09","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Taylor","original_name":"Ed Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb8a705c3a3686b0b869f7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291440,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Marriott","original_name":"Anne Marriott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb8a71bc3a3686b0786331b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0241883","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1949-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
