The film is a snapshot of his latest approach, which is to black-out advertising panels in protest of the way the media system, which is funded by advertising, is dominated by for-profit interests that have taken over public spaces and discourse. Kyle’s view is that real democracy requires a democratic media system, not one funded and controlled by the rich. As this film follows Kyle on a regular day of action, he reflects on fatherhood, democracy, what drives the protest, and his struggle with depression, as we learn that “it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”","popularity":0.4792,"poster_path":"/tAC0yizw9dswch4Ht6hNMH41uoE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victorian College of the Arts","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Measure of Health","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Hutchison","original_name":"Jessica Hutchison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb4c5ddc3a3685a14aa0125","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Hutchison","original_name":"Jessica Hutchison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb4c5cc9251412fb02a0447","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Hutchison","original_name":"Jessica Hutchison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb4c5ae0e0a2626e9cae52b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":820,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tAC0yizw9dswch4Ht6hNMH41uoE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":894,"name":"depression"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"},{"id":10907,"name":"consumerism"},{"id":15086,"name":"advertising"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":191705,"name":"privatization"},{"id":213796,"name":"public transport"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
