Black Man’s Houses tells a dramatic story of the quest by Aboriginal people to reclaim the graves of their ancestors against a background of racism and denial. Documenting a moving memorial re-enactment of the funeral of the great chief Manalargenna, the film also charts the cultural strength and resilience of his descendants as they are forced to fight for recognition in a society that is not ready to remember the terrible events of the past.","popularity":0.3991,"poster_path":"/5BUrH9CuVhAYRXX6KUSJsGIGCqq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Channel
