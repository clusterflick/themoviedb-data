After the Christmas special Frosty the Snowman (1969), it was Rankin/Bass' second hand-drawn animated work to be outsourced to Osamu Tezuka's Mushi Production in Tokyo, Japan. The show aired on ABC on April 7, 1970 before the airing of that year's Oscars. It was a tribute to early vaudeville, and featured animated reworkings of various famous comedians' acts.","popularity":1.4117,"poster_path":"/ko8ULn7yGoM2LXkhSGbt9ke4D23.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":688,"logo_path":"/hiCX3Z5p6sMWi2mF0CpLYHJy6aB.png","name":"Rankin/Bass Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8813,"logo_path":"/dPgnWLcXYwGW6Tv3xAqrI9BS2J.png","name":"Videocraft International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Benny","original_name":"Jack Benny","popularity":0.3909,"profile_path":"/nHhy8tF4WjGWvAfv0tM2pyl4D6R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5cb89a37c3a3686b0485e60d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Burns","original_name":"George Burns","popularity":0.5679,"profile_path":"/huQQweRLT1P7Xwh1j44ytEHwJry.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5cb89a44c3a3686af28607bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Diller","original_name":"Phyllis Diller","popularity":0.6016,"profile_path":"/teELYDRWmPGAVCzH4n4lX17Wa4J.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5cb89a5a92514108d1f7e239","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Jessel","original_name":"George Jessel","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/hhEwbwuBcT0JK4SiuGAYva5Yec2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"5cb89a6d92514108d5f7cf26","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack E.
