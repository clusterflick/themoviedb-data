Decades later, people are still recovering from the tragedy. Once a lively city, it is nowadays a heap of debris. Its inhabitants try to cope with the harsh reality by sharing haunting memories of the Soviet era. Thus, the days go by recalling stories and people long gone. The filmmaker captures a world suspended on the threshold of different eras, while somehow lingering in a space out of time. An ageless and intimate feeling ties together the precisely framed and edited images of people trying with great strength to defend what is left of their dignity.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/g70pbv5oLHfYRCIivNOSRHB7d4G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Verq","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Sukiasyan","original_name":"Arthur Sukiasyan","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb591ec0e0a266b93ecccb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Sukiasyan","original_name":"Arthur Sukiasyan","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb5920492514108cbf3964c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289639,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hayk Israelyan","original_name":"Hayk Israelyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb5922cc3a3681b0d80cc9d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289640,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martin Sukiasyan","original_name":"Martin Sukiasyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb592440e0a266b96ecc50a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289641,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ani Asribabayan","original_name":"Ani Asribabayan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb592510e0a266b90eccc3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"WOUNDocumentary","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g70pbv5oLHfYRCIivNOSRHB7d4G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Wound | Arthur Sukiasyan","key":"1NtbyVtf1OI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-12T12:20:57.000Z","id":"5cb5927e92514108cef3963e"}]}}}
