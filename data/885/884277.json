Throughout the centuries, the population has developed very sophisticated building techniques and created a unique architectural environment. Spectacular structures such as ten-story mud brick tower houses rise up from the valley's floor. In interviews throughout the documentary, the masons describe their working techniques and the challenges they face with the introduction of new, imported building materials. The Architecture of Mud documents the vernacular architecture, the building craft and the society they belong to.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/eAnVS8ZT90KMGKlq7WfSYactBSv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anonymous Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Architecture Of Mud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caterina Borelli","original_name":"Caterina Borelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6165fd5d238513008dbfb4d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caterina Borelli","original_name":"Caterina Borelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6165fd88238513008dbfb53f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caterina Borelli","original_name":"Caterina Borelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6165fda03a99370043ebaa2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321279","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eAnVS8ZT90KMGKlq7WfSYactBSv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Architecture of Mud","key":"_LbOeyGEww0","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-05-03T16:45:34.000Z","id":"6165fce6a802360086b2f861"}]}}}
