FORT is a short, experimental process ﬁlm documenting beach trips taken by co-directors Craig Hunter and Ryan Harman. They build forts with sheets, rubber bands, and materials (like driftwood) scavenged from the shore. These temporary shelters become an oasis for sunbathing, relaxing, and listening to music together. FORT deliberately subverts and disregards both chronology and geography to focus on the very process of constructing a beach fort.","popularity":0.0846,"poster_path":"/z4JZQnDwx9X0XIOqcVySJ1pIwGW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fort","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"FORT","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Harman","original_name":"Ryan Harman","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/gPPddBVKnbexBFFdJMwFjlKmAG2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6242a4c9223a8b004ae486b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Hunter","original_name":"Craig Hunter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6242a4d10f3655004a1200c1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Coppens","original_name":"Mathias Coppens","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/udLpMKCXX1F9siOcnyMWEQQOcY6.jpg","credit_id":"6242a43ff85958008c32e3aa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3484344,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christopher Field","original_name":"Christopher Field","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6242a47bd71fb4005be3eb8c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Harman","original_name":"Ryan Harman","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/gPPddBVKnbexBFFdJMwFjlKmAG2.jpg","credit_id":"616795938c22c0002d91ab48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Hunter","original_name":"Craig Hunter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616795a4681888008fc1e73e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17321210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z4JZQnDwx9X0XIOqcVySJ1pIwGW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1333},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vWg8jXtptMV3ZtQPe6YH3CNvWH2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FORT – Trailer","key":"554009646","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-23T18:53:32.000Z","id":"6242a4a92cde9800865cc936"}]}}}
