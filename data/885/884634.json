This short film, which makes maximum use of the black screen, could pass for an experimental film, but it is not experimental in the sense that we give it. It is a \"theoretical and rhetorical work\" on the difficult birth of an image that extracts itself from the black. Nothing to do with Kubelka or Frampton. It's a film that comes directly from what one could read in Cinéthique or Cahiers at the time. This appearance of the image is like a Caesarean section from the text.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pG5MOgUAwGmZNJhE3CC4pTC9VrP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Chant des signes","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3269827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves-André Delubac","original_name":"Yves-André Delubac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61674ec03a99370062a96e36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pG5MOgUAwGmZNJhE3CC4pTC9VrP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
