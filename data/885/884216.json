Patrick Tarrant’s film juxtaposes excerpts from White magazines from the past century and mechanical voice-over segments of an online learning module on equality, inclusion and diversity for present-day employees. – Ji.hlava IDFF 2021  \"Mandatory Training is a slightly ornery reaction to being forced to complete computer-based training and tests on matters that range from the banal to the ideological. For better or worse, if you answer wrongly on a question relating to race or gender, for example, you can, as the module explains, keep repeating the test until you pass.\" – Patrick Tarrant","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nCPpNGw4UGvPmZmmEE2XCDSJZDf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mandatory Training","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tarrant","original_name":"Patrick Tarrant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6165c082a802360086b26cf1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tarrant","original_name":"Patrick Tarrant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6165c08c6728a800431d9281","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nCPpNGw4UGvPmZmmEE2XCDSJZDf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival (online)","release_date":"2021-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
