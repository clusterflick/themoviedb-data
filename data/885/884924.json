For the film, the dolls were made using 3D scanning and photogrammetry of real characters, and then 3D printing. The painting is inspired by the stories of migrants, revealing a variety of personal, social and economic reasons that force people to cross borders. Visualizing internal and external migration routes, the film destroys the idea of migration as a problem.","popularity":0.0978,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life On The Move","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Osbert Parker","original_name":"Osbert Parker","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/nQQCbric9TmcULNyPqnYDB8hPpx.jpg","credit_id":"6168444a8c22c0002d92b4f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
