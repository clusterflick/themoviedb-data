In it, Tennyson reflects on the passing of his father, an event that was the catalyst of his family's emotional healing after ten years of estrangement due to his coming out. During that time, Tennyson created the Boy Untitled EP, whose songs chronicle his own path of emotional evolution, and more specifically, the journey of learning to forgive and how the power of that forgiveness continues to shape who he is as an artist.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ddB4LYhuFGZcOnNL701m7oyC2rI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3268709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Tennyson","original_name":"Mark Tennyson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6165f7ab6728a8002938e643","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ddB4LYhuFGZcOnNL701m7oyC2rI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
