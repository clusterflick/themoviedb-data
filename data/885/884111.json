Some of the residents wanted to put it on the central square of the city, and some strongly opposed this idea. The city split into pieces. The fact that in 1937 a GULAG camp was opened in Kargopol also played a role. More than 12,000 prisoners felled the forest here and mined peat. The film gives both sides a chance to speak.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qEHgioriDcjrM9I9NYgaV6Gnfm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kargokult","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3268232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shalgalieva","original_name":"Yuliya Shalgalieva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d263e32cc2b0073839df3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3268232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shalgalieva","original_name":"Yuliya Shalgalieva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61657138158c8500650b70b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEHgioriDcjrM9I9NYgaV6Gnfm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
