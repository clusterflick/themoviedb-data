The worst impacts are being felt disproportionately by poor people who already live under precarious conditions and are now forced to adapt or relocate to survive.  Bitterly, their stories rarely reach the global community, but hearing them is crucial for us all. Only by grasping the scope of the climate breakdown and understanding the personal implications of this collective tragedy can we propose solutions that are both effective and just.  Beyond Borders profiles the people behind the statistics by providing the space for the stories of global heating witnesses from the Arctic to Bangladesh. It also features politicians and academics who help understand the complex link between the climate breakdown, international migration and violent conflict.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Borders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
