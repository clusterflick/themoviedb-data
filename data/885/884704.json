Conductor Sebastian Weigle leads Mussorgsky’s masterwork, a pillar of the Russian repertoire, in its original 1869 version, which runs two-and-a-quarter hours with no intermission. Stephen Wadsworth’s affecting production poignantly captures the hope and suffering of the Russian people as well as the tsar himself.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/eScazPNy3Em6udz0w9jk5RK9j9Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metropolitan Opera: Boris Godunov","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Boris","credit_id":"616798efbe7f3500294d9d2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Paster","original_name":"Maxim Paster","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Shuisky","credit_id":"61679b803a99370043eeef40","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270044,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sebastian Weigle","original_name":"Sebastian Weigle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61679a6bd7f465005f9ec49a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1652328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Wadsworth","original_name":"Stephen Wadsworth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6167ab6b77e1f60094bb9f18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eScazPNy3Em6udz0w9jk5RK9j9Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
