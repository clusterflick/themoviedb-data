While in their first year of studies, they decided to invite Henrique Alves Costa, a scholar of Portuguese cinema and historical manager of Porto’s Cineclube, to guide them on a visit to Invicta Film (1917-1928), the first major Portuguese film producer. In another epoch, in Porto of the 80s, the shooting recorded this wandering by the former studios of Invicta and also by Quinta da Prelada, whose exteriors served as setting for Frei Bonifácio (1918) – film directed by Georges Pallu. Memórias (Memories) is released 34 years later of these shootings with Henrique Alves Costa.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Vieira Campos","original_name":"Luís Vieira Campos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/anueVQOAthzSPBv4n4yyB4RsESn.jpg","credit_id":"6167fa359d592c00898f9ca0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2284891,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adriana Rocha","original_name":"Adriana Rocha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6167fa09be7f3500294e3a7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Alberto Pinto","original_name":"José Alberto Pinto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6167fa28a802360043edae6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
