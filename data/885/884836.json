Come and witness these two comedians live. Thereâ€™ll be jokes, stories, gossip and quite possibly the thrilling spectacle of the onstage breakdown of their relationship.  Anne Edmonds is uncompromising, fearless and hilarious. She is a regular guest on Have You Been Paying Attention? and The Project while her alter-ego characters shine in Get Krack!n and At Home Alone Together.

Lloyd Langford is a stand-up comedian, writer and actor from Wales, who is fast making his mark here in Australia.
