During her eventful 32 year career, she served in WWII on a hospital ship in the Sea of Japan, and trained others in the Korean War. She became the Director of the Navy Nursing Corps during the Vietnam War before finally attaining the rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy. Despite having no other women as mentors (or peers), Admiral Duerk always looked for challenging opportunities that women had not previously held. Her consistently high level of performance led to her ultimate rise to become the first woman Admiral.","popularity":0.365,"poster_path":"/bJUXayYTeEgzDHAPqsuqI8CU4sV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Having served during WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, Alene Duerk became the first woman to earn the rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy.","title":"Alene Duerk: First Woman to Make Admiral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Roark","original_name":"Pamela Roark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Pamela Roark","credit_id":"62868cbdec455251272028a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Granzow","original_name":"Stephen Granzow","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Stephen Granzow","credit_id":"62868cc76c8492009d0d3096","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eliciana Nascimento","original_name":"Eliciana Nascimento","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62868cdc0d5d851db2a35a5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eliciana Nascimento","original_name":"Eliciana Nascimento","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62868ce70d5d851db3b66f96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
