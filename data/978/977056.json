In Ritual Objects, we come across a group of nuns who demystify the iconic prayer wheel, walk us through the choreography of a customary welcoming procession, and learn how to prepare a torma, or cake offering, for an intricate tantric ceremony. A selection from Peabody Award-winning documentarian Bari Pearlman’s Nangchen Shorts series, the film brings life and action to little- and well-known Tibetan Buddhist sacraments.","popularity":0.1309,"poster_path":"/6jZRnJIVd6bEC92dIENGOdJn0j4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19472,"logo_path":null,"name":"BTG Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ritual Objects","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bari Pearlman","original_name":"Bari Pearlman","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62842ea58d77c400a4c06837","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bari Pearlman","original_name":"Bari Pearlman","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a791ecaef2d00c299b7dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222928,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gena Konstantinakos","original_name":"Gena Konstantinakos","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a790e0e29a20116ac4dcb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bari Pearlman","original_name":"Bari Pearlman","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a7919174973013500e3aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1961484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6jZRnJIVd6bEC92dIENGOdJn0j4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1286}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Palm Springs International Festival of Shorts","release_date":"2011-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RITUAL OBJECTS - Trailer","key":"24153998","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-12-01T17:33:02.000Z","id":"647a7984cf4b8b0122757e68"}]}}}
