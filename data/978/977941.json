No date on the packet but it must be 40+ years old! The can had to be opened with a stanley knife, and it was full of rust. I bucket-developed it myself in caffenol & hand scanned and edited all 2000 or so frames (!). The result is this: monochrome silver-blue layers of light, time and chemicals coming together - a near half-century in the making - forms emerging from the grain and sinking back into the darkness. I traced the chemical plant back - and this little dusty reel was made in Shotska in North Eastern Ukraine.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":"/tSSL7OCVUEu0tHADUudxTkADyV4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shotska Reel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sapphire Goss","original_name":"Sapphire Goss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628780ae6c84920065b9988d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20323440","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tSSL7OCVUEu0tHADUudxTkADyV4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
