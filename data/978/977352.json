It is a choral story, populated by great figures but above all by orchestras, because ballroom dancing is not a genre for soloists. And there has never been any talk, with regard to ballroom dancing, of 'concerts', but only of 'shows', also choral, each with its own genre dynamics and costumes in which America is always cited. This documentary, through repertoires and interviews, with a focus on the private dimension of those who were the protagonists, wants to reconstruct not a history but a system of memories, an intimate and at the same time public memorial of a country that was happy.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/bvAePghRSNWQ3HUSrA5A4e4fD0W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La moda del liscio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacomo Gherardelli","original_name":"Giacomo Gherardelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"628560c313654500666429b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Cappelletti","original_name":"Roberta Cappelletti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"628560cd13654500666429c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccarda Casadei","original_name":"Riccarda Casadei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"628560da0859b4149c2fa039","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierfrancesco Pacoda","original_name":"Pierfrancesco Pacoda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"628560e41f3e60009b6f3218","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Gori","original_name":"Miro Gori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"628560eee004a600a1950030","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238076,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maurizio Grillo","original_name":"Maurizio Grillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628561529ca7591674637df2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3112244,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Camilla Cattabriga","original_name":"Camilla Cattabriga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628561401a324800515c2994","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandra Stefani","original_name":"Alessandra Stefani","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628561211365450050a112d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245017,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roberto Farneti","original_name":"Roberto Farneti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6285612f1a324800515c295d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17074264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bvAePghRSNWQ3HUSrA5A4e4fD0W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":731}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Bellaria Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
