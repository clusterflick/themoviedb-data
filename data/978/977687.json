The group reportedly allowed Elfick and Greenough to use the music in their film in exchange for the use of Greenough's footage as a visual background when they performed \"Echoes\" in concert. This short film is known to close the documentary \"Crystal Voyager\" (1973).","popularity":0.0909,"poster_path":"/1Xeins5mnzcsc6EAdmaGj3puh79.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525585,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Greenough","original_name":"George Greenough","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62869db40859b4149c340dc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Xeins5mnzcsc6EAdmaGj3puh79.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crystal Voyager: Echoes","key":"31463588","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-11-02T01:06:17.000Z","id":"62869e381a32481bd76bce1a"}]}}}
