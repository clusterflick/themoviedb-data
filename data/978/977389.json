A Nisei who was born, raised and is still living in Utah, he was the very first collegiate draft pick, and the first draft pick ever of the New York Knicks. Overcoming the national political climate during World War II, Wat was a star player for the University of Utah 1944 and 1947 championship teams, taking 2 years off in between to serve in the U.S. Army. His perseverance and loyalty to his teammates, other Nisei friends (including those interned at Topaz) and his family are a testament to the unflappable Japanese American spirit.","popularity":0.2781,"poster_path":"/prEJLjE7uTwZF5b1bSRzhFcbEY0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's the 1940s in America and the nation is testing itself.
