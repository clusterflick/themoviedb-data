From his early appearances on programs such as The Jack Benny Show and Valentines' Day, Soo's life is examined both in the historical context of the times, and the grandeur of an earlier Hollywood where stars like Soo succeeded in a multitude of artistic mediums, reminiscent of vaudevillian times. From Soo's early training as an announcer and stand-up comic, to his singing, acting and dancing career on Broadway, culminating with his signature role as Detective Nick Yemana, Soo's unique talent and dedication to his craft are fully explored and captured through a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, music, montages, interviews and stories.","popularity":1.4081,"poster_path":"/95tkNKcQjlb7KpoT84KpzF259Z4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From behind barbed wire to Broadway and Barney Miller...
