A hitchhiking triumph–even with the enormous canine companion, the camera-toting traveler never waited longer than 5 minutes roadside before ‘strangers in the brotherhood of hitchhiking’ furthered the pair down the long road west. The narration showcases the filmmaker’s gift with words as well as images. Viewing the film, we become hitchhikers as well, drawn into the mesmerizing, flickering story. Highlights include encounters with famous beatnik writers and the acquisition of a Holy Grail that has since influenced Renwick’s bright career–a copy of James Broughton’s Seeing the Light, purchased, perfectly, at City Lights Books.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/lJbg4RVD8CsjK6244IsO6Dl5nKs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SF HITCH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6284e03f9ca75916457c7963","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6284e01ef5c82400505aaee9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6284e0230d5d8545617c3811","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6284e028f5c82400a56fd05a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6284e034ec455230daf453f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lJbg4RVD8CsjK6244IsO6Dl5nKs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SF HITCH (excerpt)","key":"140552681","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-09-27T04:36:21.000Z","id":"6284e0a9e004a600a1931123"}]}}}
