Karlheinz Baumann has studied these amazing creatures for more than twenty years, in the cloud forests of Canada, in the Emperor’s Garden in Tokyo, and in the woodlands on his own doorstep. His camera takes us into a strange and exciting world, mostly invisible to the naked eye, where days pass in seconds, and microscopic creatures become terrifying giants.","popularity":0.0977,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":175567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karlheinz Baumann Naturfilme und Naturfotografie","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Als wären sie nicht von dieser Welt: Der unmögliche Lebenswandel der Schleimpilze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1818514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Stoll","original_name":"Barbara Stoll","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62852fac9ca75916457d941f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Peter Bögel","original_name":"Hans-Peter Bögel","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62852fb40859b4149d24ad2e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3554743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karlheinz Baumann","original_name":"Karlheinz Baumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62852f8b9ca75916457d9379","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2579061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Stelzer","original_name":"Thomas Stelzer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62852f9b1f3e600052de6a48","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigrid Schnizler","original_name":"Sigrid Schnizler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62852fc4f10a1a0050f3d949","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3554743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karlheinz Baumann","original_name":"Karlheinz Baumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62852fd0ec455230dbcee7b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1781753,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Volker Arzt","original_name":"Volker Arzt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5pH2EzytMzOftGcdRjM5lMTY7wl.jpg","credit_id":"62852f80bf09d10068e46362","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1277996","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2002-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
