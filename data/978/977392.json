The starting point for the video is a jarro pato, a pre-Columbian duck-shaped ceramic vase belonging to the Diaguita people of Northern Chile and Argentina, often depicted with tears streaming from its eyes.  Later supplanted by other technologies of sight and perception, including a blinking drone that surveilles from the sky and the green glowing eyes of a USB-powered face mask, the jarro pato figures into a new mythology of an evolving present–one informed by both spiritualism and capitalism.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/2CUJUwl7I7F3smJ1QekmqG1WQvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes of Plants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3294103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricia Domínguez","original_name":"Patricia Domínguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628583d51f3e600052dfe624","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1614,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2CUJUwl7I7F3smJ1QekmqG1WQvz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1076}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
