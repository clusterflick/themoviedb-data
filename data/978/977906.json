What can stand in the path of true love for Tonio is the young Swiss villager who conquers her heart - and nails a few high Cs on the way?  Director Luis Ernesto Doñas sets the action in central America, turning the revolutionary French fighting against conservative Tyrol into the struggle for Cuban liberation. Cuba as a place where two worlds confront and clash, a colourful one projected into the future and the other in black and white locked in nostalgic feelings about the past.","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":"/nxHY1UzzHMk6bl8B7vSVjlzYOmQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La fille du régiment - Donizetti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Bignagni Lesca","original_name":"Adriana Bignagni Lesca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6287637f2495ab004f8f4ff2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Bordogna","original_name":"Paolo Bordogna","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/znMGipbaFBGAFejGapyJvzkHRBk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"628763876c84920065b96986","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Osborn","original_name":"John Osborn","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/3fujch9Z6mke6VjqGXILhfPSIbm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62876390f10a1a33a95f5ae1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":578748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Blanche","original_name":"Sara Blanche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62876397209f1812c5474c25","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2454277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Bugatty","original_name":"Cristina Bugatty","popularity":0.692,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6287639eec45527218013812","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haris Andrianos","original_name":"Haris Andrianos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"628763a31f3e600067c4ac83","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556950,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michele Spotti","original_name":"Michele Spotti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628763b00d5d853e858480ba","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luis Ernesto Doñas","original_name":"Luis Ernesto Doñas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628763bb6d9fe81263688b38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nxHY1UzzHMk6bl8B7vSVjlzYOmQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
