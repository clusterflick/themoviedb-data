School uniform tartan transforms in this American urban wasteland. The girls are witches, ghosts, and kings. They hurl headlong into the unchecked passions of Macbeth—in Shakespeare’s original text—as the line between real life and blood fantasy quickly blurs. Through prophecies and smartphones, unexpected resonances emerge from Shakespeare’s dark nightmare of ambition gone awry. These young women discover what's done cannot be undone.","popularity":0.5801,"poster_path":"/482DeBP9GZT167OojLpC1OTG4xr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138611,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Bull
