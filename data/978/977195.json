In this new work, Carmen is stripped of her usual associations, including gender, race, place and time, leaving only a universal human figure and Bizet’s oiseau rebelle (rebel bird), two alter egos competing for love. This struggle leads to rebirth and a new future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9HDRyukuQS5fLcZJyMjybbxoFQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'amour rebelle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Joseph Butler","original_name":"Roy Joseph Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62852666fa78cd2dc5bb3859","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3554728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merav Eldan","original_name":"Merav Eldan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6285266ae004a6006607cff6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Crane","original_name":"Leo Crane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6284daf39ca7591674619550","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19063442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9HDRyukuQS5fLcZJyMjybbxoFQH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
