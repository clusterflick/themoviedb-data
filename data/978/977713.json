He makes up his mind to descend to earth and get familiar with the kind of life people lead. He chooses the city of Sofia for his excursion. His first contacts are by no means encouraging. Strolling along the streets in the capital in his outlandish Mephistophelean costume, he is chased and stoned. Then the devil puts into operation his tiny machine for printing money. Dressed in the latest fashion he continues his walk unmolested. Money opens the doors of the richest homes for him and he soon becomes a member of the capital city's high life. The devil chooses a prostitute as his partner, who introduces him to her family. The father is a thief and a drunkard so that the mother is forced to be the bread-winner. Satan and the prostitute find themselves in the whirl of easy life.","popularity":0.0667,"poster_path":"/aO6znOYZsQOWt8TEqy8pvkzxdeV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gendov Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1921-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil in Sofia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Dyavolut v Sofia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732998,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vasil Gendov","original_name":"Vasil Gendov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f2yFeJekP2m41eQ0lANxW0QTZqW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Devil","credit_id":"6286a6dc1f3e600052e4005f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2252229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhana Gendova","original_name":"Zhana Gendova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xSGo4OGkGntSWHUMQtuOcWvBa8s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prostitute","credit_id":"6286a6ee209f18009c6517e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3556118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Popov","original_name":"Ivan Popov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oZ0JBjFuihVaDgvI7xwy6tFkQ3B.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Father","credit_id":"6286a7261a32481bd6103a2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meri Mihaylova","original_name":"Meri Mihaylova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"6286a7371a32481bd76bf3a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Sotirov","original_name":"Georgi Sotirov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Brother","credit_id":"6286a7481d356300965b7440","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556114,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Josif Reifler","original_name":"Josif Reifler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6286a6ceec4552512689d22b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732998,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vasil Gendov","original_name":"Vasil Gendov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f2yFeJekP2m41eQ0lANxW0QTZqW.jpg","credit_id":"6286a6c00859b4149c342f89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0322111","wikidata_id":"Q12279331","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aO6znOYZsQOWt8TEqy8pvkzxdeV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
