So, reality is not a big deal when you are used to it. But opening the eyes a little is all it takes to produce a few gentle cracks on the ground of perceptual habits, and realize that things – including the urban architecture we pass by everyday – have their own energy; that steel, concrete, asphalt all have an unexpected vibrancy. In this way, the frame becomes a force field, without a defined and final shape. A dynamic and fragmented world held together by editing and non-uniform acceleration.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6P8S9oSdCeBmqCbopn63Kp8RYqa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Epoch Isn't a Big Deal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Tamarit","original_name":"Ignacio Tamarit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628651c41f3e60009b71e4ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3555744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Maglione","original_name":"Tomás Maglione","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628651d08c22c0009ca65e22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6P8S9oSdCeBmqCbopn63Kp8RYqa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fracto Selection","release_date":"2022-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Laterale Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
