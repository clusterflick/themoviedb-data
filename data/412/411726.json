In Donegan's almost psychedelic renditions, a silver-garbed, red-wigged performer capers in a theatrical non-space of foil, plastic, police tape, and rescanned video images of Tommy star Ann-Margret. In Channeling in 4 Versions, actress Garland Hunter enacts the scene, and then, in a silent version (Channeling in 5 Versions), Donegan herself takes the role.","popularity":0.0669,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Channeling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheryl Donegan","original_name":"Cheryl Donegan","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/ooo1r68pk6I8f400juj6KAEr48n.jpg","credit_id":"57b4787592514170f7000506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q19818522","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
