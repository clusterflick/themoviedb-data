This tradition includes works in which the filmstrip is directly manipulated by painting, scratching, or otherwise placing objects on it. This tradition was probably originated by Len Lye in his hand painted A COLOUR BOX from 1935. To create his piece, Gregg Biermann cut up an orange into several pieces and scanned the pieces into his computer. He then took the image files of the orange pieces and “pasted” them directly into the video strip using a photo editing software package. This technique then transforms the orange pieces into what appears to be a random exploding jumble of images when viewed.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregg Biermann","original_name":"Gregg Biermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b2b364c3a36830db00350c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
