An explanation of each key nutrient - carbohydrates, fats, protein, vitamins, mineral and water - is included, with an emphasis on the need for balance.  Students will learn about the food pyramid as a guide to maintaining a healthy balance in their daily diets.  The program explains how we get energy from the foods we eat, measured in the form of calories, and how we burn that energy when we exercise.
