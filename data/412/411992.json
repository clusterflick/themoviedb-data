Lewis shares an apartment with Bradley Miller ('Ross Hunter') and Michele (Fritz Feld), an artist, and Miller has just invented a non-staining lipstick called \"Rosebud.\" Preparing to get a booth at the show, Miller is told by J. Webster Hackett (Alan Mowbray), a very devious \"Cosmetics King,\", intent on selling a big lipstick order to buyer Edgar Pomeroy (Thurston Hall), that it will cost him a $1000 to join the association and get a booth, which is about $999 more than Miller and his roomies have between them. But Miller's beauty-parlor girl friend, Janet Wilson ('Ann Savage'), meets factory-owner P. G. Grimble (Hugh Herbert), and money is soon no issue.","popularity":0.9469,"poster_path":"/2XFvNtM4UYSdCR5VIU8XXwcayNm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WOO WOO!
