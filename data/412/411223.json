First Lady of the Revolution is the remarkable story of Henrietta Boggs, who fell in love with a foreign land and the man destined to transform its identity. Her marriage to Jose ‘Don Pepe’ Figueres in 1941 led to a decade-long journey through activism, exile and political upheaval and, ultimately, lasting progressive reforms.  First Lady of the Revolution is not only a depiction of the momentous struggle to shape Costa Rica’s democratic identity; it’s also a portrayal of how a courageous woman escaped the confines of a traditional, sheltered existence to expand her horizons into a new world, and live a life she never imagined.","popularity":0.1226,"poster_path":"/v0k4gX60xsEig9SJsDXbc4pEbvC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10081,"logo_path":"/wKHQ5Kr7tIedRPg5eOt0I8ciaye.png","name":"Spark Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A southern belle's journey through love, exile, and revolution.","title":"First Lady of the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Primera dama de la revolución","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrietta Boggs","original_name":"Henrietta Boggs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57af8e1d925141456e000e0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muni Figueres","original_name":"Muni Figueres","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6319e4af1d1bf4007ea10761","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Kalin","original_name":"Andrea Kalin","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57af8e0492514172f40056c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784180,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Luis Portillo","original_name":"Luis Portillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654622dd926a0037416026","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2012055,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leo Fallas","original_name":"Leo Fallas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6545d1dbcade003917d280","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784176,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Mirabello","original_name":"James Mirabello","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6545a908cf87003a44bb8b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Kalin","original_name":"Andrea Kalin","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6545701684f700374c3445","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211437,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paulo Soto","original_name":"Paulo Soto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6545bbaf3da6003728e5ee","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909051,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Grossbach","original_name":"David Grossbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6545df57530e0036a868d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784179,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diana Moss","original_name":"Diana Moss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6546105a78840033b1f3ab","department":"Crew","job":"Production Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Kalin","original_name":"Andrea Kalin","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6545635c564e00355ed0c4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3037676","wikidata_id":"Q24905132","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ejuVNb0g32dr3jmK6sHgVj34xe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v0k4gX60xsEig9SJsDXbc4pEbvC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sidewalk Film Festival","release_date":"2016-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"YJdanDExRJE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-06-15T19:50:36.000Z","id":"6319e461880c92007f1317b5"}]}}}
