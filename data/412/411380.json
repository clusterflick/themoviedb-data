Kirk, the film has lost none of its hallucinatory power. The short goes deep into the structure of Peter Care’s original film and the Cabaret Voltaire tracks used in connection with it. What emerges is as much a juxtaposition of times and places as sights and sounds. The tale changes in the retelling, but that change now seems to be taking place on a molecular level. Richard H Kirk has reconfigured the film’s soundtrack, giving the proceedings an ominous sense of something slowly sliding into view from afar, glimpsed out of the corner of the eye.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":"/jb6JJSEI1mqjLpYxTP5uFFQLyxw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Yesno Redux","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Cohen","original_name":"Isaac Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57b0b92192514141f400188b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Lin","original_name":"Andrea Lin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57b0b929c3a36843230005fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8408,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Salvatore Totino","original_name":"Salvatore Totino","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/f5En0e3AQq5ggj5lscVAbB3wh5y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57b0b92fc3a36804e90017e9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Care","original_name":"Peter Care","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/5et8w1K3xm9BW0J1ARcqkFA1vEp.jpg","credit_id":"5fcd08783f7e1d0042e60cd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1374899","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1233,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r0EQnGcg7i0hZSk0suHfrNajYmr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2192}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1292,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jb6JJSEI1mqjLpYxTP5uFFQLyxw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":882}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Johnny Yesno (Redux)","key":"vIrGTujhZGE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-08T23:30:59.000Z","id":"5e922a6ad55e4d001517fa24"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cabaret Voltaire Johnny YesNo Redux","key":"8NLs9Q6GyCw","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-10-25T12:20:31.000Z","id":"5e922a01875d1a00124292d4"}]}}}
