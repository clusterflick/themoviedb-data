They become mixed-up with the U. S. flying corps and are wafted over the enemy lines in a runaway balloon. Through misunderstanding they are honored as heroes of the enemy forces, and sent back to the U.S. lines to spy. Here they are captured and almost shot, but everything ends happily. Only 20 minutes of this 6 reel comedy are extant.","popularity":0.5954,"poster_path":"/8FLoOaOQAd3fAEX3YIotif4vGzn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now We're in the Air","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Beery","original_name":"Wallace Beery","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v8cHzbuHEqNUYmO7Oj66Im424uR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wally","credit_id":"58dfda00c3a3683d3e00bda8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Hatton","original_name":"Raymond Hatton","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/eTiQiDcMhwD3DCE6yINa7RKd5NJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ray","credit_id":"58dfda15c3a3683d4600ac9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Simpson","original_name":"Russell Simpson","popularity":0.2131,"profile_path":"/sZAJ7TS52RxyejiirXhhqmYxxwn.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lord Abercrombie McTavish","credit_id":"61aab45bbf09d10095c133be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Brooks","original_name":"Louise Brooks","popularity":0.2995,"profile_path":"/z5SZ8JIMJxdJC0L3uwz0aSzvQfH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Griselle and Grisette","credit_id":"58dfd9ec9251415e3600b492","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Émile Chautard","original_name":"Émile Chautard","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/kl4uS46oKd46Nf0OpPps33If9tm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Monsieur Chelaine","credit_id":"58dfda36c3a3683cff00b52b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Waite","original_name":"Malcolm Waite","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":"/t87UppsC6eXbhMrcWIgFI11jspi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prof. Saenger","credit_id":"58dfda489251415e3c00b8ee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duke Martin","original_name":"Duke Martin","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Top sergeant","credit_id":"61aab471cb75d100631f2c6c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Stevens","original_name":"Charles Stevens","popularity":0.2465,"profile_path":"/5mCi2fkG5pn68RXaNSDa6eVouPm.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Knife Thrower (uncredited)","credit_id":"61aab47e8efe73001de162fd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adolph Zukor","original_name":"Adolph Zukor","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/h4gkeIGlb8fybIxrPokalu23oFX.jpg","credit_id":"58dfda909251415e3600b518","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":34170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank R.
