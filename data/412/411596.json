As he trains for the title fight, the trash-talking, steroid-taking champ Spencer “Timber” Collier played by Allen Maldonado (“Straight Outta Compton,” “Black-ish”) does everything he can to take Jaxon off his game. The stakes are high and family drama, thirsty groupies, and a manager with a serious gambling problem are all vying for Jaxon’s attention, making it difficult for him to stay focused on the task at hand – winning the belt. In the midst of being pushed to the limit both physically and mentally, Jaxon meets a beautiful photographer Endira (Raney Branch; “The Originals,” “Grey’s Anatomy”) who captures his heart while hiding a devastating secret.","popularity":0.4108,"poster_path":"/dqgcfPkqnflaTcEUkKG4BhGKHN4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ringside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphen Banks","original_name":"Stéphen Banks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bqshlPvWDI3MluH8Zk49Aa848vd.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"TC's Entourage (Dancer)","credit_id":"58f1eb9fc3a3682ede0064f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julissa Bermudez","original_name":"Julissa Bermudez","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/odhqpFpMBgbhojm4gjhPen2OTGY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"58f1ebbd9251412fb9006ee6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christie Black","original_name":"Christie Black","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58f1ebcdc3a3682e3f0065e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1497918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raney Branch","original_name":"Raney Branch","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/kguhyax96QgIB3j94qE9zBRgC5j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Indera","credit_id":"58f1ebe5c3a3682e3f0065fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashanna Bri","original_name":"Ashanna Bri","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/amakS5jrX50fGNvhPOfMJWDYsJ9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Carmen's Cousin","credit_id":"58f1ec699251412fb9006f7e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catero Colbert","original_name":"Catero Colbert","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/jelrUqeuGcHUTzCVaY08AfAEyzV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Club DJ","credit_id":"58f1ec7f9251412fb9006f91","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Daurey","original_name":"Dana Daurey","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":"/zz8KUenvE4r8WEbAXh6wCUiBVCP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dealer","credit_id":"58f1ec95c3a3682e3f0066a4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rahima Delvero","original_name":"Rahima Delvero","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ueUtv4nJ1eGHu3CYU34fVYu5JCk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ex-girlfriend","credit_id":"58f1ed4c9251412fb1007062","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1634344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Moore","original_name":"Lynn Moore","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"News Reporter","credit_id":"58f1eda99251412fa9006cce","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":188162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russ Parr","original_name":"Russ Parr","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591e0d251a64e0483f43b98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":188162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russ Parr","original_name":"Russ Parr","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6591e0dc6aa8e061abeb50da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5493000","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqgcfPkqnflaTcEUkKG4BhGKHN4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
