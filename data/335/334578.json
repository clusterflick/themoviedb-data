Main actor and director Al St. John was the nephew of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle and considered as a wonderful pantomimist and an acrobat. The film was actually directed anonymously by his uncle. Being part of a series called \"Tuxedo Comedies\", Lovemania was set up by producers like Jack White and Joseph Schenck so that Arbuckle could work behind the scenes, since he couldn't appear on screen due to his 1921 scandal.","popularity":0.3391,"poster_path":"/s2daD5lVybQfDepbAJoKDy9KCRI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Comedies Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovemania","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al St. John","original_name":"Al St. John","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/u6jepFCiItOjfo9wP3yU2ZLZFgE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"552268b89251416d4a000f66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Deane","original_name":"Doris Deane","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/g3mWdT4CPGSGcCfur03DwylDoLN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"552268c0c3a3685733001053","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Davis","original_name":"George Davis","popularity":0.2837,"profile_path":"/jZX35AsIZnuQX7crHu6QqOAH182.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"552268cbc3a3684dda005bda","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Cavender","original_name":"Glen Cavender","popularity":0.3429,"profile_path":"/mkCWTmyWtInbtNiSkBaUU20DgXz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"552268d1c3a3684dd4005e6c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Doirs","original_name":"George Doirs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Uncle George","credit_id":"552268da9251415c870056f8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Hoff","original_name":"Joan Hoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"552268e69251415c7c00583f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sinclair","original_name":"John Sinclair","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"55226909c3a3684dd4005e71","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al St. John","original_name":"Al St. John","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/u6jepFCiItOjfo9wP3yU2ZLZFgE.jpg","credit_id":"6266dbd65ab81a009a111f82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","original_name":"Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle","popularity":0.2092,"profile_path":"/p0pR1wMRfRfLWZfdHywQcqph8vp.jpg","credit_id":"552268ac9251415c7f0055fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al St. John","original_name":"Al St. John","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/u6jepFCiItOjfo9wP3yU2ZLZFgE.jpg","credit_id":"552268a09251416d6a000f17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0492251","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oMkFwtOYf20HlM23nDFOba9lxAK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s2daD5lVybQfDepbAJoKDy9KCRI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
