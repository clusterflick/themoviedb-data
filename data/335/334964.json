Cold. No sound except for the chattering of cicadas and the voice of a GUARD making his report on a walky-talky. MAX TAYLOR barges past him, incapacitating more guards until he breaks out of a building and makes his way to a checkpoint barrier. He is about to pass the barrier when he's surrounded by men in white coats. They drag him back into the building. Taylor is a patient at a military institute for highly trained soldiers and spies who have lost their sanity during combat or secret missions; they're kept under sedation and observation until such time as they're deemed fit to return to active duty. The next morning, JOHN DANCE walks through a secure reception area, asking HENRY WALSH (the institute's chief administrator) about the patients. Dance is introduced as a psychiatrist charged with assessing the institute's viability and the patients' mental stability.","popularity":0.1838,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snap Judgment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cold Soldiers","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2046960,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Smith","original_name":"Nick Smith","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619584c2497560002cf5f403","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2837570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Erickson","original_name":"Trevor Erickson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9ce5981511aa0039a4e94f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1384960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
