The most popular of all is The Great Bazandini. Villagers clamor to see his act, but one person knows it’s a sham...his daughter, Mirza. She desperately wants to escape this world of swindlers, but standing in her way is the carnival’s ringleader, notorious conman, Dr. Leopold Rundy.  MIRZA THE MIRACULOUS is a short lo-fi sci-fi experimental B-movie adventure incorporating dubbed gibberish voices, abstract art, remnants of Mardi Gras costumes, toy props, dustbuster spaceships, on-screen text and analog electronic music. It’s absurd, kaleidoscopic and homemade.  The movie was originally shot on an abandoned Western movie set on the Texas-Mexican border in 1999, but was abandoned due to technical difficulties. 15 years later, the project was revived by a successful Kickstarter fund-raising campaign. The original footage was reimagined and re-edited with new technology to create a one-of-a-kind film.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/jhjWFOUmUS1rGZz8IHmUwszw8oR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirza the Miraculous","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Soileau","original_name":"Paul Soileau","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Leopold Rundy","credit_id":"5521c29b9251415c7f004053","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Joseph","original_name":"Brent Joseph","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/cYz7zkD4ieFFxygaAuY3oFfMwTG.jpg","credit_id":"5521c234c3a3684dc1003ec3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quintron","original_name":"Quintron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5521c257c3a3684dda004438","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Joseph","original_name":"Brent Joseph","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/cYz7zkD4ieFFxygaAuY3oFfMwTG.jpg","credit_id":"5521c240c3a3684dc90037de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1773381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zac Manuel","original_name":"Zac Manuel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c1c9b9a64350037ae242e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4083080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jhjWFOUmUS1rGZz8IHmUwszw8oR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
