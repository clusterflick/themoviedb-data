Mastorna Detto Fernet became a graphic novel, just before Fellini's death in 1993. This is the story of how that came to be, as told by long time Fellini collaborator and illustrator for ll Viaggio di G. Mastorna, Milo Manera. Combining still photography and moving images, the piece which was produced in conjunction with Fabrica, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011. The short is anchored by an interview with Milo Minara shot entirely in stills. The interview discusses his personal take on the main existentialist themes of the book; this interview has been intercut with the actual graphic novel and what appears to be the lost footage (via recreation) of the story's first scene. This short doc is an exploration into dreams and fantasy, moving through different realities. Shot between Milan, Italy and Koln, Germany.","popularity":0.2042,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabrica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Derailments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106878,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milo Manara","original_name":"Milo Manara","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/aixE7SZ1LKUgDJLm4REEjnZR5P2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587b8290c3a368426e002540","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265925,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Derek Howard","original_name":"Derek Howard","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b2e71fd63000081973ada","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3760931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ted Bois","original_name":"Ted Bois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b2e86d38b580079b9eb48","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1265909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chelsea McMullan","original_name":"Chelsea McMullan","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/zZSlJbGxXVp7BILwbAOoQa3rHPW.jpg","credit_id":"635b2de3fd63000079a816eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265925,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Derek Howard","original_name":"Derek Howard","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b2e7af288380083174688","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1913999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo S.
