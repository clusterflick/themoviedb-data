A successful actress, Madison was one of many women who directed films at Universal, particularly in the mid 1910s. In this two-reeler, she stars as a young city girl dragged into a life of crime by a ne’er-do-well suitor. A terrific surprise ending gives Eleanor and Cleo an early claim to promoting women’s equality in the workforce.","popularity":0.1731,"poster_path":"/z02Hnzmm1wCy7ryFaRRMmsibvHc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eleanor's Catch","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleo Madison","original_name":"Cleo Madison","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/z7CkuJJTARgVfvdol4voHIMiqtu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Eleanor McGrady","credit_id":"551efe319251415c87000015","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lule Warrenton","original_name":"Lule Warrenton","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/cKT15bHW6ysYEHryH2gqrhRWbRW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eleanor's Mother","credit_id":"551efe3d9251415c7a000021","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hearn","original_name":"Edward Hearn","popularity":0.2862,"profile_path":"/hoGoldV0nyWdrnf8qqG4zpuzcmq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"'Red' McGuire","credit_id":"551efe51c3a3684dd400001c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William V.
