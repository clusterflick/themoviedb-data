Hammer employs filmed footage which, through optical printing and editing, is layered and manipulated to create a compelling meditation on her visit to her grandmother in a nursing home. The sense of sight becomes a constantly evolving process of reseeing images retrieved from the past and fused into the eternal present of the projected image. Hammer has lent a new voice to the long tradition of personal meditation in the avant-garde of the American independent cinema.\" -- John Hanhardt, Biennial Exhibition Catalogue, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1987","popularity":0.2736,"poster_path":"/yXSPOR5vbtKLVyozG5fb9aPW0yR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Optic Nerve","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","title":"視神經","type":"Title by Macao International Queer Film Festival"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5522be02c3a3684dd40069e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0459489","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yXSPOR5vbtKLVyozG5fb9aPW0yR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":623}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5903,"name":"alzheimer's disease"},{"id":4995,"name":"aging"},{"id":163484,"name":"senior citizen"},{"id":164039,"name":"grandmother"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","release_dates":[{"certification":"D","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Macao International Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
