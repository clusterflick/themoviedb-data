This unearthed white scarf covered in crimson drives May to attempt suicide. May is taken to a psychiatric ward under the care and influence of Dr. Ballard, psychiatrist/acclaimed author (Eric Roberts). May is immediately thrown into seclusion. Detective James Harding (Busey), appears to question May about a horrific murder. This questioning thrusts May into narrating an in-depth story about an unnamed woman's involvement with unsavory characters leading to multiple murders.
