The movie as a whole is an exposition of the events in Nympha’s life that lead to this scene. Nympha is a young girl reared and morally sheltered by a hypocritically pious elder female relative. The girl’s blind piety, however, is ripped apart by her sudden awareness of the sexually-charged environment and by her own first love affair. Eventually, she goes from man to man, driven by her demonic desires. Her unwanted pregnancy finally leads to a gory, fatal abortion.","popularity":0.239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1971-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nympha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1450878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rizza","original_name":"Rizza","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55238b8cc3a36834530058ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Gamboa","original_name":"Philip Gamboa","popularity":0.2823,"profile_path":"/nOpGoWdbhWWKvMgzXMKzNkhIonm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55238ba392514171cb0057ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Flores","original_name":"Bella Flores","popularity":0.3332,"profile_path":"/hphAUXQrYUus7Fr9f6OHZwKqyEm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55238baf9251417096005809","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romy Diaz","original_name":"Romy Diaz","popularity":0.1224,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55238bc4c3a3680bb6002035","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Celso Ad.
