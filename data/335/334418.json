Jacob and Rebecca marry; he's a rabbi, she's dutiful and loving. But she has no children. Months become years. Although Jacob is content, his mother reminds everyone she is waiting for a grandson. After 15 years, Rebecca determines that Jacob must take an additional wife, the young and beautiful Sultana. Rebecca fasts and prays, and in a state of near ecstasy, persuades everyone involved and then arranges an elaborate wedding. However, Sultana does not conceive, and Rebecca watches helplessly as Jacob's affection shifts to Sultana. She's near madness and the household is in turmoil. What can Rebecca do now?","popularity":0.3416,"poster_path":"/j2WhZpNoReuMdFbxsjxKYN0U7oN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1996-01-02","revenue":9225,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"נשים","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Women","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Nashim","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Nasheem","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michal Bat-Adam","original_name":"Michal Bat-Adam","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/tLuNP0PWKJ3Mv3GZqufdzpvyDin.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5520ec48c3a3683453000ca9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arieh Elias","original_name":"Arieh Elias","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":"/fbWqhSn3kEEvE3aqw8O6npe9JRW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5520ec50c3a3683453000cad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levana Finkelstein","original_name":"Levana Finkelstein","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5520ec579251417096000c57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Ahnov","original_name":"Boris Ahnov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9a779b66a7c30039979b84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shosha Goren","original_name":"Shosha Goren","popularity":0.1668,"profile_path":"/3Yi7ESmkEOw0b9a1Uyzid3XK3Qe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9a77a487ae7b0035e27680","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rivka Gur","original_name":"Rivka Gur","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9a77aeb4a543003636d3d2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moshé Mizrahi","original_name":"Moshé Mizrahi","popularity":0.1833,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5520ec199251417096000c51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1398473,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amnon Zlayet","original_name":"Amnon Zlayet","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/v6zEZ21Y9Dx5UFxIAy6VCKRPTai.jpg","credit_id":"6455167487a27a015432e9f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amitan Manelzon","original_name":"Amitan Manelzon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a77e64cbe120036c02b1e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2834858,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yehuda Burla","original_name":"Yehuda Burla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a77cb17c44300363339d2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moshé Mizrahi","original_name":"Moshé Mizrahi","popularity":0.1833,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a77d7b4a54300393763ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Sharfstein","original_name":"Michael Sharfstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a77ff66a7c3003896f67e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53096,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tova Ascher","original_name":"Tova Ascher","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a78249a9f9a0036546789","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0117152","wikidata_id":"Q52837040","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j2WhZpNoReuMdFbxsjxKYN0U7oN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/nr421iYRTfdscB4pNX42IwhytSx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
