Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats, the way the victims and the perpetrators within each community deal with this legacy will determine the countrys future.  USPOMENE 677 will show you the viewpoint of each ethnic group through a new generation, the sons and daughters of that war, who are struggling to come to terms with their toxic past.  USPOMENE 677 is a story of our time. But the time to tell this story is short. Today, in a Bosnia fighting for EU membership yet threatened by possible return to war, the new generations, often in contrast with their parents, are desperate to find a way to live together for a different, peaceful tomorrow.
