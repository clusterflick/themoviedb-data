I was invited by the artist to make a contribution to an exhibition of his work at the September Gallery, Berlin. The resulting work was a series of film portraits of the hand carved heads which were part of the objects which Lindvall had created for the exhibition. Through this disambiguation of the heads from the objects originally intended by the artist -a series of chairs- the film created a refined perspective of the sculptural quality of the objects as entities in themselves stripped of any functional purpose. The film was informed by conversations in which I discussed with the artist his conceptual concerns in the making of the objects. The resulting silent film projection stands alone as a work in itself with an archival quality evocative of ethnological observations of tribal objects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Greenway","original_name":"James Greenway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55244f56c3a36828d10071e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
