It further explores Shankar's life as a musician and teacher in the United States and Europe, initiating those in the West to the exceptional world that is Indian classical music and culture. Through rare and candid footage shot in both India and the United States, Raga sheds light on Shankar's influences and collaborations, from Allauddin Khan to his famed dancer brother Uday Shankar, to his associations with Western musicians Yehudi Menuhin and George Harrison. Fully narrated by Shankar himself, the film reveals music as the soul of India and of Shankar's life.","popularity":0.4058,"poster_path":"/x7Yz2ZgEihbyxxVwqKBKwG2yUUJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3797,"logo_path":"/pG2RaiOwELHvPJnjrPUbwzkTTxc.png","name":"Apple Corps","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film journey into the soul of India.","title":"Raga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13745,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ravi Shankar","original_name":"Ravi Shankar","popularity":0.274,"profile_path":"/seZPaYPkBtx4nnDtRXWrUc2x7t3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55246a7e92514166c1003a9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Harrison","original_name":"George Harrison","popularity":0.9156,"profile_path":"/zwUO2gnKBnSrKOB9hnhI9GdOX6e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5594459b9251410e92003c33","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Worth","original_name":"Howard Worth","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55246e52c3a3680bb6003ac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451294,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nancy Bacal","original_name":"Nancy Bacal","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55246e699251414752002a39","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0067648","wikidata_id":"Q7282787","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/96Al7gCGKDBibK2iR9yY0lOx3S3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1438}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x7Yz2ZgEihbyxxVwqKBKwG2yUUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1113}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191623,"name":"sitar music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Raga: A Film Journey to the Soul of India (Trailer)","key":"lvaY3-E7ToI","published_at":"2010-08-16T21:24:59.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"55246e0c9251417be2008e29"}]}}}
