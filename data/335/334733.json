Cuts to two ponies on a seesaw, with a moustached man in a white uniform with dark piping and a white cap holding their leads. A second trainer in a dark suit can also be seen occasionally with the ponies. Individual ponies perform a variety of tricks, including rolling a slatted barrel across the stage with front legs and then with a nose, knocking over the barrel, \"limping\" across the stage with one front leg held off the ground, and pushing the trainer over with a nose-butt.","popularity":0.3727,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Tinker's Pony Patter","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450966,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"H.A.
