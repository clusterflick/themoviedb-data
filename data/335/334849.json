It trembles on the line between the violent and the risible. Featuring actors and objects, YOU ME AND IT traces a world where cruelty is ticklish but always looming. There is the supposition of a body being tenderly corroded. Striking text elements manifest the voice or voices of some other. Music and sound add another shade to the  evocation of a pathetic narrative. While comprised of carefully considered components (visual, textual and aural), You Me and It operates on the total repetitions of deferred, frantic energy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Me and It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1451218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anita Delaney","original_name":"Anita Delaney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552451679251417096007010","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
