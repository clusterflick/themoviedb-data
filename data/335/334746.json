In this process, when later projected at a constant speed of 24 fps, the image on screen changes in time from a representation of cars passing in front of the camera to an image in flux and a collision of transparent colors and dynamic motion. One might also think of it as a rendering and transformation of one industrial phenomena (the automobile), by another industrial phenomena (the motion picture camera). What arises – as an experience – when 'visual phenomena' starts, thrives, and ends within the 4 borders of the rectangle and we do not project extensions to them? How startling when occasionally, and just for a moment, a bird enters the frame, and creates 'space' against a light blue 'sky'.\"  – Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0849,"poster_path":"/nJNYXj70CQDdR45cPm6FwXRFmS7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transparency","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"5523ee86925141709600658f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0159799","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nJNYXj70CQDdR45cPm6FwXRFmS7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":" 7½th New York Film Festival","release_date":"1969-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
