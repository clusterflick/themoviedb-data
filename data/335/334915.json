Ramlee’s Penarek Becha, they also produced this melodrama centred around another humble trishaw driver. Like Ramlee’s film it was co-written by young literary upstart Jamil Sulong (who later became a director). Similar issues around class, wealth and modernity are explored through the tale of a kindly older trishaw driver (Omar Rojik) who adopts Jamilah, an orphan and marries her guardian, offering her a simple but better life (including a very, very long visit the circus). As the years pass Jamilah pulls away from her impoverished kampong life towards a world of motor cars and monied families, while kind Omar’s health is failing. A classic slice of social-realist melodrama.","popularity":0.0595,"poster_path":"/r2wm8SDFKJ16wbAJXCkeI21mjs3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1955-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1278926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Datin Saadiah","original_name":"Datin Saadiah","popularity":0.1831,"profile_path":"/tR6OAiYoMOCHkBe5HkKSWRLdxky.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"563c8f889251417819003ad5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siput Sarawak","original_name":"Siput Sarawak","popularity":0.6384,"profile_path":"/fJbxWVjCXcPpvLv5fiom7ZiGRTr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"563c8fb4c3a3681b61027d47","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omar Rojik","original_name":"Omar Rojik","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/5GzfPr9ozhXrdz8A3wLZNcbtauG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"563c8fd0c3a3681b4b02462f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Mahmud","original_name":"Ahmad Mahmud","popularity":0.2285,"profile_path":"/5B8nEB8WqjZkpWDYvztigiHvncu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"563c8fe29251416d5201809f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latifah Omar","original_name":"Latifah Omar","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/k7xIeREOi72zep8IbX4zAUqFKak.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"563c90269251414ab7024cf8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K.
