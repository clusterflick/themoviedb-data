This film returns us to that time of chaos, documented in a visceral patchwork of news coverage and home video. The emotional distress was high and the physical tasks daunting as everyone worked to put the fragments of the world back together. But how do you cope if you can't? The urgency of those days was marked with valor, kindness, and unprecedented camaraderie. But also with fear, panic, anger and blame; Patriotism blooms, but so does prejudice. This film takes us back to the beginning of the world we now live in, offering a glimpse into how it was remade.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/cUIX8iVyZPgehBi1shMrOVwCebb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/11: The Days After","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2075077","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cUIX8iVyZPgehBi1shMrOVwCebb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1521}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
