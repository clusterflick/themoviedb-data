Despite his noble birth, his horoscope showed to be born under the sign of thieves, and thus was preordained for a wicked life. On his 16th birthday his father sent him to complete his education and Arhingsaka became the teacher's favorite; the other jealous students told the master that Arhingsaka was flirting with the teachers wife. Deciding to punish his former star pupil, he told Arhingsaka : \"You have almost completed your training; there is just one thing left to do. Once you finish your life of suffering will be over, and you will become a Bodhisattva. You must single-handedly kill 1,000 people\"","popularity":0.2691,"poster_path":"/zkWeA0yn3GurAYx4DKRHIOXQ33y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1240,"logo_path":"/c2PD8Niiv5NzY7wnRpWaQ3hGzPu.png","name":"Film Bangkok","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2003-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angulimala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"1000 - Blut wird fließen!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nopachai Jayanama","original_name":"นพชัย ชัยนาม","popularity":1.0321,"profile_path":"/3lH30WSs7dmmYJqmBIQUF1jfrBQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Arhingsaka / Angulimala","credit_id":"55f3bee1c3a3686d0b002274","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella Malucchi","original_name":"Stella Malucchi","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nantha","credit_id":"55f3bee1c3a3686d18001f06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Rattanaveroj","original_name":"John Rattanaveroj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Vikul","credit_id":"55f3bee29251413a96001489","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamron Gunatilaka","original_name":"Kamron Gunatilaka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sati","credit_id":"55f3bee29251417f760018db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1508700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alisa Kajornchaiyakul","original_name":"Alisa Kajornchaiyakul","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/nXskyehGI2SafBjrChS8sch8FCW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mantanee","credit_id":"55f3bee2c3a3686d0300219d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caterina Grosse","original_name":"Caterina Grosse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3bee29251417cfc001629","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Varin Sachdev","original_name":"Varin Sachdev","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3bee3c3a3686d18001f09","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anant Sammarsup","original_name":"Anant Sammarsup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kakkapakawa","credit_id":"55f3bee392514174730007f8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618082,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sutape Tunnirut","original_name":"Sutape Tunnirut","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573230f992514105b90002da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618082,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sutape Tunnirut","original_name":"Sutape Tunnirut","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5732310ac3a36869150002d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417431","wikidata_id":"Q4764029","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1875,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zkWeA0yn3GurAYx4DKRHIOXQ33y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1326},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1989,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/oXHYoOiRmWXe23akGUUnppk40nZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1326}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Buddhist Film Festival","release_date":"2009-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Film Festival","release_date":"2004-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Buddhist Film Festival","release_date":"2005-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Angulimala Trailer (full HD)","key":"XkmIvD9Hl1M","published_at":"2013-09-08T06:16:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"578bcf549251413f74002386"}]}}}
