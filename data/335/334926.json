The simple aim of this series was to didactically select several elements of film naturalism, which work to create the illusion of representation on screen, and make each the subject of a self-descriptive film using that element as subject and demonstration. So Lip sync is about sync sound and the disruption of it, Deep Space is about camera stability and invisibility of the camera apparatus, and Lens Tissue is about clarity of the image and focus. Each of them works by disrupting the element and foregrounding the effect on film, and flattening the representation from image to projected filmstrip.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Space.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Dunford","original_name":"Mike Dunford","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55252af9c3a3687df800140d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
