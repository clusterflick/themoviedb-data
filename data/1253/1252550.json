Cork is on a mission to record the sound of every bird species in Ireland – that’s nearly 200 birds. Often joined by his partner Alba, he travels to some of the country’s most beautiful and remote locations to capture its most elusive species and soundscapes: the busy seabird colony of Skellig Michael; a native woodland free from road noise in the Burren; the corncrake stronghold of Tory Island; a solitary nest in the Donegal uplands. Along the way we get to know Seán, whose hypersensitivity to sound has proven both a struggle and a strength. At once inspiring and cautionary, Seán’s journey illustrates the beauty and importance of sound, and what listening can tell us about the state of our natural world.","popularity":0.2811,"poster_path":"/uYFWyABYoJgaG9vBXO5kktLSBvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"At once inspiring and cautionary, Seán Ronayne's journey reveals the beauty and importance of sound, and what listening can tell us about the state of our natural world.","title":"Birdsong","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4566431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seán Ronayne","original_name":"Seán Ronayne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/6XQUk7ebbtCMeq3p98pehcApHLi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65e1b8ed6c449c0186fa717d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathleen Harris","original_name":"Kathleen Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e1b8db41a561016383077f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uYFWyABYoJgaG9vBXO5kktLSBvz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14985,"name":"ireland"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":240242,"name":"birds"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"RTE","release_date":"2024-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
