Grooms are good as a selection, but how to choose the most worthy of them? And then the old man came up with a task for them: to bring a golden apple from a distant island located at the other end of a huge lake. Whoever copes with the assignment will become Marika's husband. The grooms raced to get an apple, but it turned out that not everyone was allowed to approach the magic apple tree. Only a person with a pure soul and a kind heart will be able to pluck the cherished fruit.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/qKskWgq3HNTcJlAQ5pxi32nV98w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7501,"logo_path":"/hz8piJ9Np1MswUyav0JDNGf42pO.png","name":"Soyuzmultfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tree with the Golden Apples","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1928959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Dabizha","original_name":"Nataliya Dabizha","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":"/9nCw4iFYLszmMIqu9EQZoePibjO.jpg","credit_id":"65e1101651f99a0162569225","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673191,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan-Willem Bult","original_name":"Jan-Willem Bult","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bYr3ig0DHI1HQbRxI8XtD9ypNkw.jpg","credit_id":"65e110259dee58017c7ce92b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKskWgq3HNTcJlAQ5pxi32nV98w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
