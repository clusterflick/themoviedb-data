Checkpoints, demands for permits and the apartheid wall surrounding the occupied territories are all part of the struggle of daily life.  ‘Freedom to Run’ follows Palestinian running group ‘Right to Movement’ and a group from Glasgow as they train for and run, both the Palestine and Edinburgh marathons. Whilst in Palestine, the Scottish runners learn about the impact of the restrictions on everyday life, and that something as universal as running is a far from easy task. The runners discover that they are not so different, but that they live very different lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o4FNDFd1Pw7A2PnwtMWe9CFAZBz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom to Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Sheriff","original_name":"Stephen Sheriff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e1900f9dee58017c7df1b1","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566241,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cairsti Russell","original_name":"Cairsti Russell","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e18ff6f85958018650e976","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cairsti Russell","original_name":"Cairsti Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e18fea2d531a0185c1ec22","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o4FNDFd1Pw7A2PnwtMWe9CFAZBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
