Turn the image upside down: nothing more, nothing else, nothing. During the pandemic, drones flying over the empty city became oversaturated. Media coverage fixed our imagination into one way of reading a city/space. I return to the idea of ma”—empty or open spaces (interval or pause in time). This piece was created with this additional perspective, creating a contrast to City Hall, legendary documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman’s four-hour long film.. Here I try to present the meditational quality of the empty city hall. The project was presented by local art organization Non-Event with support from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concrete: Boston City Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1967810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wenhua Shi","original_name":"Wenhua Shi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e277aedd25890163f202ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
