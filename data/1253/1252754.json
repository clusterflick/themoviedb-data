It traces lines of loss and confronts failure of memory. A cameraless handmade film, it employs a laser printer to image directly onto clear film leader, creating both (optical) sound and image. Each printed sheet contains 231 frames patiently composed and assembled one by one: 9.6 seconds of projected film. It utilizes two texts: digital video I shot of a galium sphinx moth compulsively dive-bombing a light that could destroy it, and a manuscript page from my father’s unpublished memoir in which he describes visiting his own father who was dying of Alzheimer’s. My father found him imprisoned in a state hospital, brutally beaten and bruised, strapped to a gurney, unable to speak.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/i6Nl5etAp88fkmSWqOrx7m7zl6z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moth Print","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Bliss","original_name":"Sarah Bliss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e229e6d18572018528f12e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i6Nl5etAp88fkmSWqOrx7m7zl6z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
