French authorities ban political parties and unions. In Algeria, the leaders of political and trade union organizations were arrested and interned in \"surveillance\" camps with more than 2,000 French and foreigners: communist activists, trade unionists, brigadists, Spanish republicans and other opponents of the Vichy regime. The Djenien Bourezg camp is one of these camps, located in southern Algeria and is one of the most formidable. An old activist for the Algerian national cause returns to the scene. He blows away the ashes that cover this part of history. And through it, we discover the hard fight of the camp inmates for respect and human dignity, under a fascist command.","popularity":0.3641,"poster_path":"/o5V9eKpGIVqeFAOWjn026geybPb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under The Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"Djan Bou Resk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3317378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdelkader Alloula","original_name":"Abdelkader Alloula","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/yiV4sdAp8vqTt3O4I5oD39zJDvo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65e240e5daf57c01859ea8f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mustapha El Anka","original_name":"Mustapha El Anka","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/Oeo9hlktDEp0iq0CcngYPZ2xEc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65e240f0dd25890186f219dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4359186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ouardia Ould Taleb","original_name":"Ouardia Ould Taleb","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65e2410b41a5610163834ccb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2770618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcel Khalife","original_name":"Marcel Khalife","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/u7EFUA3imdUgtYl3VFaLEUPR7lU.jpg","credit_id":"65e24053a284eb0187d60be8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4567402,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aziz Hamouli","original_name":"Aziz Hamouli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e23fd7dd2589014af1c3fb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4567400,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Akli Metref","original_name":"Akli Métref","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e23f7fd18572018528fdc7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1807996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdelkrim Baba Aissa","original_name":"Abdelkrim Baba Aissa","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/x98l5HnUM8Z4dWtEtNUGohwCVP4.jpg","credit_id":"65e23f4951f99a01855995c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1807996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdelkrim Baba Aissa","original_name":"Abdelkrim Baba Aissa","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/x98l5HnUM8Z4dWtEtNUGohwCVP4.jpg","credit_id":"65e23f4dd18572016228e460","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3484747,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saïd Guénifi","original_name":"Saïd Guénifi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e23fae51f99a0162578330","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31530769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ovfgbdfl5kro2ES9xqU4PSVbRcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m6IWmUf3wQMg5RjoPnaaQY6bKHL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7x9MAAMb9Ic2DaeYEV1SdRKiyM6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5V9eKpGIVqeFAOWjn026geybPb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":3207,"name":"concentration camp prisoner"},{"id":7041,"name":"sahara desert"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":207901,"name":"political prisoner"},{"id":231020,"name":"anti-fascism"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":296484,"name":"algerian cinema"},{"id":328713,"name":"militant cinema"},{"id":329418,"name":"algerian director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
