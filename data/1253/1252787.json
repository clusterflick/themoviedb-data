The film features Bella, a North American luna moth, as she gently flutters between sticks and bells. Her moth-ly movements create the filmâ€™s soundtrack as her human companion hand-dances alongside her. Working together, they co-create a healing soundscape as both entities, moth and human, share a common dialogue of sounds, symbols, and intimacy.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bella Luna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4567301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia L.
