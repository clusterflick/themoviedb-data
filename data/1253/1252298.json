The title takes Dan’s joking last words to his mum, Fiona, before he left home for what turned out to be the last time: ‘I Love You, Mum – I Promise I Won’t Die’. Mark worked on the very first production with his talented youth theatre company in Southampton, Oasis Youth Theatre, and the play had its first public performances in March 2016, with previews in Southampton and its premiere at the BRIT school, just a mile from Dan’s home in Croydon, South London.","popularity":0.3439,"poster_path":"/d9N8p7uvCeWypn61cSuTjqvLUus.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"I love you mum, I promise I won't die","title":"I love you mum, I promise I won't die","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cobie Scott-Ward","original_name":"Cobie Scott-Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fiona Spargo-Mabbs / Hope","credit_id":"65e0e463daf57c01859c8a68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Colley","original_name":"Alex Colley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tim Spargo-Mabbs","credit_id":"65e0e487a284eb0164d42f6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Radfords","original_name":"Sean Radfords","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jack / Jacob Spargo-Mabbs / Dan Spargo-Mabbs","credit_id":"65e0e4b0391b9c0163824616","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Zoldan","original_name":"Amy Zoldan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jenna","credit_id":"65e0e4bea284eb0187d475b6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Montgomery","original_name":"Elliot Montgomery","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0e217f8595801634e9940","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Wheeller","original_name":"Mark Wheeller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0e864a39d0b018608b8e6","department":"Writing","job":"Original Film Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Wheeller","original_name":"Mark Wheeller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0e87007e2810163dc6ab0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d9N8p7uvCeWypn61cSuTjqvLUus.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3447,"name":"charity"},{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":215662,"name":"awareness"},{"id":251961,"name":"drug"},{"id":284103,"name":"theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"While previously perform was DVD released in 2021","release_date":"2021-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - I Love You, Mum - I Promise I Won't Die","key":"6CFQ8mJ32Us","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-27T17:41:44.000Z","id":"65e0e6aa2d531a0162bf80f8"}]}}}
