In addition to towns and landscapes, the film shows well-known landmarks such as the Hermann monument. The film is a child of its time and refers to the blood-and-soil ideology of the National Socialists in its depiction of a supposedly idyllic rural life. At the same time, the film is intended as an advertising film. In fact, the production was commissioned by the Westfälische Provinzial-Feuersozietät to draw attention to fire hazards that could destroy the cultural assets shown in the film.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":222127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stoecker-Film AG","origin_country":""},{"id":222128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westfälische Provinzial-Feuersozietät, Münster","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das geht jeden an","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Mühlhardt","original_name":"Kurt Mühlhardt","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/lOxCCGVeFNlAbKdw0suHjXHxIOt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65e091d7a806730184a94e98","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122412,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Armin Petersen","original_name":"Armin Petersen","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0911d4f9a99017ac5fd7a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564765,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erich Stoecker","original_name":"Erich Stoecker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0913c391b9c018682cb23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564769,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hans Rathke","original_name":"Hans Rathke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e091b707e281017cdd1e8d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dr. A. v.
