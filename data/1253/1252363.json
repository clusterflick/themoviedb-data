Following other compromising situations and his declaration of needing “personal liberty” Marcia divorces him. Still enamored of Leila, he marries her, but she remains a selfish flirt and Otis Vale, whom Leila has driven insane with her teasing, abducts her. In the mad dash away their automobile tumbles over a cliff, killing them both. When Harleth learns that \"Mrs. Crossey\" has died, he imagines it to be Marcia, and rushes to her. The relief he shows convinces her that their \"invisible bond\" is intact, and they reconcile.","popularity":0.2196,"poster_path":"/zzqwFwfk74iCcsUaun2nqPUtNhM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a wife who was true to a husband who was false.","title":"The Invisible Bond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Castle","original_name":"Irene Castle","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/gHHsxjXFNqpLfHB78odcPVdka8T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marcia Crossey","credit_id":"65e109b2daf57c01629b8684","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huntley Gordon","original_name":"Huntley Gordon","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/dlZO1dnpaVuiJyZ3BitziRgolXB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harleth Crossey","credit_id":"65e109b8daf57c01859c9f27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Adams","original_name":"Claire Adams","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/2My48FqA4jYmwBjA6gsNbIF9rkV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leila Templeton","credit_id":"65e109bd51f99a0185579949","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Majeroni","original_name":"George Majeroni","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":"/hzi9XBlwH3Zgz4QoPr26rmjnFrD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wasson","credit_id":"65e109c9a284eb0164d43734","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Greene","original_name":"Helen Greene","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/8wyDtpYYCdABaQCAkSR5Zvu5Fgw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Imogene","credit_id":"67d9d6498ec5c4ce442cca7d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Waterman","original_name":"Ida Waterman","popularity":0.2718,"profile_path":"/ArVjw1xc2lURPdVNP9Z0edbIOoM.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Crossey","credit_id":"67d9d65d34f861aed80e87b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warburton Gamble","original_name":"Warburton Gamble","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/suUhUL3vS3ORLJ6PcHwnwD9dlVi.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Otis Vale","credit_id":"67d9d6788ec5c4ce442cca90","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fleming Ward","original_name":"Fleming Ward","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Curtis Jennings","credit_id":"65e109c3f8595801494df5cd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1702022,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Faxon M.
