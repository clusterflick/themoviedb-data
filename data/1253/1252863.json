The concept of this \"little films\" (as Jonas Mekas once called them) is more to create a short, autonomous work, a cinematic moment that stands alone and for nothing and no-one else. Over the years this has resulted in a series of absolutely unique, exceptional works. Each director has created his/her own cinematic world between home movie and political essay, music film and minimal étude, mysterious story and radical, aesthetic abstraction on those little films, that will now be shown together for the first time on the occasion of the Viennale’s great 50th anniversary, premiering at the Locarno Film Festival.","popularity":0.2382,"poster_path":"/oXqNYiEquVn7YqgsXqEikJLc3m9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"20
