It is in search of health, not romance, that he books in for a week at the Elm Park Hydro and submits himself to a regime of rest, exercise, and starvation rations. When he meets the attractive Deidre Mackay, he finds himself experiencing emotions he never thought he'd feel again. From each other they learn how to live and how to love. They relive their youths-pulling pranks, laughing and dreaming. With a love so powerful, their time together is of no consequence. For it is a moment that stands still in time. A Moment In Time will make you laugh and cry and share a love that you'll never forget!","popularity":0.4558,"poster_path":"/1Ut1KtYdM0tnnWrecrU4CLKIWMb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14063,"logo_path":"/b7od4dXpqSHIYQx5ykwjnzfKiNv.png","name":"Granada Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Moment in Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Down At The Hydro","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Simmons","original_name":"Jean Simmons","popularity":1.5897,"profile_path":"/scbR91Bl4SbfQqhXaH6OfhjxfYt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Deidre Mackay","credit_id":"65e0fcefa284eb014bd40e4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Carmichael","original_name":"Ian Carmichael","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/rTgRKxbcxRbEhbY88wYTstZRDDt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Colonel Hunt","credit_id":"65e0fcff41a56101868263e1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Irvin","original_name":"John Irvin","popularity":0.3002,"profile_path":"/gF3FWhmbiwD96E1DP68F07LkX1m.jpg","credit_id":"65e0fd0ea39d0b016307d9f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78517,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugh Whitemore","original_name":"Hugh Whitemore","popularity":0.1991,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0fd1f9dee58017c7cdf42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Sansom","original_name":"William Sansom","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0fd2ff8595801634ea07f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1Ut1KtYdM0tnnWrecrU4CLKIWMb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
