His research takes the form of a personal, playful and musical diary, crossing borders and archives. One day, he arrives at an electronic recycling workshop where the ghost of a working poet manifests itself. The search takes an unexpected turn and he sets out, in the company of his cat Pendrive, to explore the links between technology and memory.
