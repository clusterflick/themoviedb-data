His mother is an award-winning writer, who lives as a recluse in a country house and commits suicide when the degenerative disease of old age begins to threaten her independence. André then goes to her house for a weekend, getting rid of the furniture and books, sharing them with friends and family. In an increasingly empty house, he is faced with his own inability to solidify himself as an adult, to escape his mother's shadow and find his place as a man and artist at forty years old. Surrounded by the bush on all sides, the protagonist's depression leads to increasing paranoia, intensified by alcohol. Lost in a scenario of delusions, memories and literature, André will face his internal and external nature, in a war where everyone nearby can be a victim.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/veqaYNwRlTzETG3UDpE0IMpVuDP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drama Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Biophobia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081895,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renato Ciasca","original_name":"Renato Ciasca","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e272ed2ea6b901854efbdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beto Brant","original_name":"Beto Brant","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/a57C9Vx8d9z4A3UKeVbbX7HMkTJ.jpg","credit_id":"65e272fbf85958018651f1df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/veqaYNwRlTzETG3UDpE0IMpVuDP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
