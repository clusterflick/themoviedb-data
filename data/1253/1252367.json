FEE shows a young Barth with an unidentified girlfriend. The films of the Barth Collection start in Germany in 1927 and continue into the early 1960s, long after Barth moved to the United States. Barth worked for Agfa in Germany, and later Binghamton, New York. Barth visited both Knoxville and the Great Smoky Mountains during the 1930s, shooting 16mm home movies, and then moved to Knoxville late in life (1970s), to be closer to his son, then working at the University of Tennessee.  Zschornewitz is a village and a former municipality on the southwestern edge of the Wittenberg district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The Zschornewitz Power Plant, seen in the background, was once the world’s biggest brown-coal-fired power station.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walther Barth","original_name":"Walther Barth","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e10d4f6a300b017d1dd822","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dr. Walther Barth – Fee","key":"75641756","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-09-28T11:31:29.000Z","id":"67b7b13c444dd7fcefba2dc3"}]}}}
