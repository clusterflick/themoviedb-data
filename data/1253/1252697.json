Les archives sensibles","overview":"Dickinsonia, a 550-million-year-old oceanic species, has left very few fossils. Its soft, skeleton-free body has left almost no trace of its existence, leaving scientific thought in doubt. Like the dissolution of this ancestral life form, our oldest memories, blurred and embedded in the depths of our consciousness, seem to leave only vague traces. Unexplained ripples that run through our tissues, shaking us at times. The film is intended to be a place of intimate listening which, by allowing us to see and hear subtle presences and vibrations, invites us to pay particular attention to the fragments of history that constitute us, especially those we have wished to forget.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dickinsonia.
