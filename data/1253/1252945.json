Through the intimate lens of six focus groups across three American cities, UNDIVIDE US explores conversations around the most divisive topics of our time and uncovers the potential for healing conversation. Aiming to awaken the silenced majority that seeks solutions rather than strife, UNDIVIDE US is not just a documentary; it's a timely and urgent plea to reclaim the nation's soul through open discourse, civic engagement, and democracy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ywBA2rAhSTa7ymKp8vtMRbxRL3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Undivide Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31113775","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ywBA2rAhSTa7ymKp8vtMRbxRL3E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1933}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Big Apple Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
