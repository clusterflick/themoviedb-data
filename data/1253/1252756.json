The techniques used in the film are a mix of analogue and digital: actual painting in the house, digital rendering and avatars, stop-motion painting, drawing, and collaging, with the majority created in Detroit and subsequent scenes finalised in London. With an original score by Susanne Deeken in collaboration with experimental and jazz musicians from Detroit.","popularity":0.791,"poster_path":"/zHdRsmSAo02NBVCArQJXDzU7hTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Place Without Fear","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Ebeling","original_name":"Victoria Ebeling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"670052ef9ebea19006f830fc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e22ad941a561018684686b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700528cc9a10d46ea7ce5f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700530a925fdf925b7ce51d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67005310925fdf925b7ce520","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700531667c6fb09fff82086","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700531df878adfed0853bd9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Cicchetti","original_name":"Nick Cicchetti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67005328f878adfed0853be8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Deeken","original_name":"Susanne Deeken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700532ffa3e69e0ef7cda79","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420717,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Hurley","original_name":"Dave Hurley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67005337f878adfed0853bf0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4203192,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rafael Leafar","original_name":"Rafael Leafar","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700533efa3e69e0ef7cda92","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981131,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Peters","original_name":"Chris Peters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700535c9ebea19006f8311a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981133,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Ray","original_name":"Simon Ray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67005369fa3e69e0ef7cdab0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31971209","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/31gtUPJw0a1iM5wSEQvIOfRZPRD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1715,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zHdRsmSAo02NBVCArQJXDzU7hTM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1143}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"EcBOOshGWt8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-10-02T11:00:12.000Z","id":"67005262c9a10d46ea7ce5eb"}]}}}
