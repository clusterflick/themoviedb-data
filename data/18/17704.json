Using beautiful images of unspoiled healthy waters, The Living Sea offers hope for recovery engendered by productive scientific efforts. Oceanographers studying humpback whales, jellyfish, and deep-sea life show us that the more we understand the ocean and its inhabitants, the more we will know how to protect them. The film also highlights the Central Pacific islands of Palau, one of the most spectacular underwater habitats in the world, to show the beauty and potential of a healthy ocean.","popularity":2.5593,"poster_path":"/TnXJlonfRHsYhePYIPH85PQbIw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2753,"logo_path":"/zlL22wCmcblgNo68WyFu6nYghKT.png","name":"MacGillivray Freeman Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-02-01","revenue":87600000,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"IMAX The Living Sea","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"IMAX - The Living Sea (1995)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Mares apasionantes","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wunderwelt der Meere","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Żywe Morze","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Живой океан","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meryl Streep","original_name":"Meryl Streep","popularity":2.6996,"profile_path":"/g5cVxQBAQ3AXt3LhdBXtbbN47Uc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe47419251416c7509300f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Connor","original_name":"Judith Connor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"556245e3c3a3682206002e1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie K.
