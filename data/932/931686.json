What is now expressed with the hitherto unknown word Holocaust, hits many millions of people in the heart. The unexpected echo and the audience reactions were fierce. Even before the TV broadcast neo-Nazis blasted in vain transmitting towers in Germany to prevent this. From the creation and the shooting over the broadcast to the tremendous reactions, documentary filmmaker Alice Agneskirchner tells the story of this emotional television event, which led to a paradigm shift in the perception of German Nazi crimes.","popularity":0.6938,"poster_path":"/oRxjwhNLbjFNS15Pqnumlt2D7R9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hanfgarn & Ufer Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Holocaust came to Television","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1896663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadja Schulz-Berlinghoff","original_name":"Nadja Schulz-Berlinghoff","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/5xE1TEMEfEmE2NM6lxoPNgvyDOq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6373fc5ad7107e00755516f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Harris","original_name":"Rosemary Harris","popularity":0.7748,"profile_path":"/3Mu02enwaF8dFuT195f7esILXns.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6373fc6a68ff70009c990397","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Baker","original_name":"Blanche Baker","popularity":0.366,"profile_path":"/smbKFqnjTTpaSxeUrNWrvmd8PJf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6373fc7643999b00826aa9cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Moriarty","original_name":"Michael Moriarty","popularity":0.5915,"profile_path":"/2EY162LDxpVVG6g10lm70uxkNJp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6373fc81a217c0007624c1b8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2660598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Lessing","original_name":"Hanna Lessing","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6373fc8beb09320091f484d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marvin J.
