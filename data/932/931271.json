Alongside the hypercars there was a full-grid of 25 LMP2 cars, 8 LM GTEPro and 23 LMGTE Am cars.  The shift of dates to August meant the weather may well play more of a part than in June, but with a full testing schedule already completed and the grid bursting with talent, there was every chance of a thrilling race, right down to the last few laps.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wf1Wbw5s67tqSB6Y3UzpPp99c9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 2021","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wf1Wbw5s67tqSB6Y3UzpPp99c9D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
