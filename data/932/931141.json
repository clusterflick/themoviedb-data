Giacomo Abbruzzese reconstructs his grandfather's story, immersing us in the New York of the 1960s, with Billy Joel's sounds and a gangster movie atmosphere.  Through the testimonies and memories of his relatives, on both sides of the ocean, we discover a mysterious, complex character, perpetually on the run. It is the portrait of a man that nobody ever really knew.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/twahl9Z5P9MqvKLwfopQclkyIxE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79189,"logo_path":"/yPWHBZdThBtCyWbe07gKj37g6LL.png","name":"La Luna Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":115156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maje Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","original_name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/8L5uwJdzmGgHu8vxrJPZj5DMz2p.jpg","credit_id":"61f119839e458600d91dfe4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","original_name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/8L5uwJdzmGgHu8vxrJPZj5DMz2p.jpg","credit_id":"61f11952c5ada500cd8e5594","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","original_name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/8L5uwJdzmGgHu8vxrJPZj5DMz2p.jpg","credit_id":"61f118e0cd2046001b6bb254","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398975,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alessandro Altavilla","original_name":"Alessandro Altavilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f119d1c5ada5001c246326","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398976,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Helen Papaioannou","original_name":"Helen Papaioannou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f119e9e4886000429495be","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17446516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/twahl9Z5P9MqvKLwfopQclkyIxE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
