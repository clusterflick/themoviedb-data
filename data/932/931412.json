At the beginning of this work they actually were due to a technical and numercial problem with my video file. The images were chosen randomly, their refresh rate being low, they are superposing and confusing for the viewer's conventional vision. I did not rework the sound which was taken «as is», and thus can make the viewer feel like time is slowing or freezing. We never hear the end of the sentences, which requests a lot from the viewer' imagination. The images question the idea of narration and are for one's own interpretation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t9HcfhFBAJXni4fPBZVZwSeyFmH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tease Strip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3400028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Ledda","original_name":"Jeremy Ledda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f20102498bc200cb8e65d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9HcfhFBAJXni4fPBZVZwSeyFmH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
