Dancing playfully on her crutches, Claire frustrates Lee’s romantic advances, transporting him away to daunting environments where he’ll need to think on his feet if he’s to win her affections.  Director Simon McKeown worked with actor Lee Soar and choreographer Claire Cunningham to create this colourful motion-capture animation which was first broadcast on BBC Big Screens across Britain in 2010. Mckeown explores themes of power, control and rejection in the work and originally created two versions with different endings for festival audiences to choose from – ‘win’ or ‘lose’?","popularity":0.1503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Claire sets her suitor Lee some tricky challenges in this colourful animation","title":"All for Claire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3399810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Soar","original_name":"Lee Soar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lee","credit_id":"61f1d237df294515b83d7bb1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3399808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Mckeown","original_name":"Simon Mckeown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f1d1db66565a0043598ff6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3399809,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Claire Cunningham","original_name":"Claire Cunningham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f1d1fd559d22001b8a1c38","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1976518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
