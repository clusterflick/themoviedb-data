Bennie Swanepoel is on his way back from his backpacking trip through Europe, on the eve of the Swanepoels' big annual Swaneball bingo championship. However, when Bennie makes his appearance, it's clear that things are going to work out very differently this year. His father is furious. His mother is pale. And his grandmother ... well, to the family's dismay, she's standing squarely behind Bennie. To make matters worse, Grandma decides over the course of the bingo tournament that there should be more at stake - especially for Bennie.
