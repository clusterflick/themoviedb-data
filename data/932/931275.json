This applies to the taz, the daily newspaper from Berlin, more than to any other newspaper. Taz - that means shimmying from crisis to crisis, living on the edge of self-exploitation for almost 25 years now. Born as a left-wing project in the leaden times of the RAF terror and the news blackout, conceived as a counter-public, scorned as a left-wing fighting press controlled by Moscow, smiled at by the established competition, today it is doing well on the battered German print market. A loyal readership, a solid subscriber base, and the cooperative structure carry the left-wing newspaper, which is always on the lookout for the special view, through stormy times. The film shows makers, readers and comrades.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4uBN6qEWPFTzWpvp2H69kjt5BDG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zwischen Marx und Mainstream - die taz wird 25","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4uBN6qEWPFTzWpvp2H69kjt5BDG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
