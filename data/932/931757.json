These confessions, however, are delivered by female surrogates - Roee Rosen 1, 2 and 3 - three illegal foreign workers residing in Israel. They deliver the monologues in Hebrew, a language they do not speak, by reading a transliteration of the text to Latin letters from a teleprompter. Marks on the teleprompter scroll indicated to the performers to occasionally mimic the body movements and facial expressions of the real Roee Rosen, at the other side of the camera. The text is built as a hybrid: on the one hand, it offers a rather dubious account of my own \"crimes,\" but on the other hand, it is partially plausible as a monologue of a foreign worker.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confessions of Roee Rosen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roee Rosen","original_name":"Roee Rosen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iafIF5mGOs4PY970AiU1d9E5vZ.jpg","credit_id":"61f327ac3009aa011b913a56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4146862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
