Dropped into the life of this family, a helicopter is gradually enfolded into their daily rhythms, transformed into something utterly unexpected. In this land free of electric cables, cows find a shelter and children set up their private playground in it. Patient observations through the rusted “eyes” of this helicopter unfold a story of a remote place exposed to just one piece of civilization.","popularity":0.096,"poster_path":"/ZrpQQvV9obI9LNw1zZsyA6Q41N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2006-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their Helicopter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1609390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salomé Jashi","original_name":"Salomé Jashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ujdCNb7Jloo4qlwQn02c1bQknE5.jpg","credit_id":"61f1d3abe9da690045c5a7a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8092338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ZrpQQvV9obI9LNw1zZsyA6Q41N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ka","note":"Imprecise release date","release_date":"2006-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
