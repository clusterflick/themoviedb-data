I filmed the pictures on the screen while they were digitizing, and made my own editing with some kind of mystical connotation.  I intensified the strangeness of this place by working on the sound (radio interference) adding some furtive and quite ghostly apparitions of myself. When I watch this film now, I can think it has a lot to do with the horror movies which were my delight as a teenager. But it's more of a joke about this omnipotence artists are credited with by society â€” this idea of artists being able to venture on psychic territories that no one else can reach.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neige pour media froid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3400028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Ledda","original_name":"Jeremy Ledda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f2018417792c001b940e22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
