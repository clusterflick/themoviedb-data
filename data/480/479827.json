The filmmakers use current technology and ideals of pleasure to depict this perfect future. Director Michael Anderson finds meshing these two worlds an exciting challenge, especially in trying to create something that has never been seen before in the movies. The studio's technology department plays a key role in creating Anderson and David's vision. The movie's stars, Michael York and Jenny Agutter, provide their take on the movie, their roles and working with each other and with fellow co-star Richard Jordan. The filmmakers also need to create the antithesis of the modern Utopian world for the scenes taking place outside of the domed world.","popularity":1.3002,"poster_path":"/wAVeERVF69WuwqRowLBBVd3BJEE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind the scenes look at Logan's Run","title":"A Look Into the 23rd Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Agutter","original_name":"Jenny Agutter","popularity":2.0305,"profile_path":"/hxroyCTMk54hesfCRo4g6Jwc8dT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c89b745c3a368644f0c8b36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael York","original_name":"Michael York","popularity":1.6727,"profile_path":"/tutdIz0uuQ6fyPMoQ4HpCgy2uQu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c89b79e9251410ccfc24a90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20412,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Anderson","original_name":"Michael Anderson","popularity":0.3497,"profile_path":"/kdLnSeVCkM9Wm4R9UccyvOCqvAQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4171217a97ab000ea790b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2656972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Weber","original_name":"Karl Weber","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5ecee067e61e6d001ecc3229","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":62719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Anson","original_name":"Jay Anson","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4170e1b87aec2c3d40fbf3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronald Saland","original_name":"Ronald Saland","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/mGxlD6qx82vlzcEUib8foIAebMb.jpg","credit_id":"5d4170cb34e1520791e793ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0284269","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wAVeERVF69WuwqRowLBBVd3BJEE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":733}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
