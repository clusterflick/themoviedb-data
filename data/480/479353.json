This is one of the central questions that The Price of Fairness sets out to answer, beginning with a surprising set of social experiments in Norway, which suggest that our willingness to support systems of inequality is far greater than we are often prepared to admit. In Atlanta, we take a different look at fairness, from the perspective of a group of capuchin monkeys. Behavioural scientist Sarah Bronson's work with the monkeys questions the idea that we have an evolutionary tendency towards selfish behaviour. Could it be that the outrage we feel towards systems of inequality have roots in our human need for cooperation? Touching on issues of economic, political, racial and gender inequality, this film offers a thought-provoking and timely look at what fairness really means to us.","popularity":0.1533,"poster_path":"/uwS46WWG2HcNRSeoDYAZ8QQvqJQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146473,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monkey and Me Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Price of Fairness","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Fairness: Zum Verständnis von Gerechtigkeit","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Πόση δικαιοσύνη αντέχουμε;","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gabbay","original_name":"Alex Gabbay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feba280aa659e003ded0bf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gabbay","original_name":"Alex Gabbay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feba288b42242003e406df8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gabbay","original_name":"Alex Gabbay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feba29064f716003d0fcb03","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724112,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dhritiman Das","original_name":"Dhritiman Das","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feba2a3d40d4c0041866a6a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wajid Yaseen","original_name":"Wajid Yaseen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feba2b3d40d4c0041866aa0","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gabbay","original_name":"Alex Gabbay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feba298d40d4c004085d9b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6896058","wikidata_id":"Q30301513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uwS46WWG2HcNRSeoDYAZ8QQvqJQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
