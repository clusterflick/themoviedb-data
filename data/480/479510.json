His wife, Nancy, is the dream of every middle-class male. She is liberated enough to go around bra-less, enjoy sex, and be the perfect mother for their child. Nancy, however, is unaware of her husband's excursions and happily attends the local ecology awareness meetings without Bill. Bill soon becomes involved with Gordon, an Andy Warhol-type character whose protege, Roz, fascinates the square young businessman. After witnessing a wild party on Fire Island, Bill realizes that this crowd is not for him (shallow, lifeless) and that he does not even want to have sex with Roz because he is lonely for his wife. Nancy arrives unexpectedly on the island to reclaim her husband and together they walk off into the sunset hand in hand.","popularity":0.2789,"poster_path":"/mxIYD0AmNzu3Y639sssY0C7sEvs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Four Stars Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":95784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caka Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A sensual film about the state of the union.","title":"Okay Bill","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sweet Dreams","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62024,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bob Brady","original_name":"Bob Brady","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Bill Thornberry","credit_id":"59d62f18c3a36832670113ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Felio","original_name":"Gordon Felio","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Zachary Armstrong Lynn","credit_id":"59d62f289251417f280106de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":165381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roz Kelly","original_name":"Roz Kelly","popularity":0.3434,"profile_path":"/fre3rXUbUPlbtm4wbUkT4HKmtMw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roz","credit_id":"59d62f319251417f5c010dc1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Salmon","original_name":"Nancy Salmon","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nancy Thornberry","credit_id":"59d62f3ec3a36832060115db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theon Banos","original_name":"Theon Banos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59d62f44c3a368324a00f94c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiger Morse","original_name":"Tiger Morse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59d62f4bc3a368324a00f953","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818736,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Morrow","original_name":"Charles Morrow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d62fc59251417f760111e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John G.
