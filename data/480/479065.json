Not a single road leads there. A long trip on the Ienissei River, first by boat, then by helicopter, is the only way to reach Braguino. Self-sufficient, both families live there according to their own rules and principles. In the middle of the village: a barrier. The two families refuse to speak. In the river sits an island, where another community is being built : that of the children. Free, unpredictable, wild. Stemming from the fear of the other, that of wild beasts, and the joy procured by the immensity of the forest, unravels a cruel tale in which tensions and fear give shape to the geography of an ancestral conflict.","popularity":0.4077,"poster_path":"/fVpnuaL6TX7isLPLNqhiEa44vtL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16266,"logo_path":"/4BqNNUJgq1wojHPDgL90oL4LW58.png","name":"Seppia","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making
