She, the Revolution Hunter, tries to enter in that picture as if she could enter into a time she didn't belong and finally understand what it means to be part of a revolution or what it means to fight for a country.  A film that explores the relationship between two generations, two different times and two different fights. As if we could transform a photograph by drawing on it. As if we could transform the present by drawing over the past.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":"/wkQNUPkme35htev1qTFVUuJ5e3t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal College of Art","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Revolution Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margarida Rêgo","original_name":"Margarida Rêgo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"59d4ebb2c3a368451b0166e2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317910,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Wyeld","original_name":"Mike Wyeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4ebf4c3a368455001974c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margarida Rêgo","original_name":"Margarida Rêgo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4eba79251414b99018a5f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1864905,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Paredes","original_name":"Carlos Paredes","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4lAIzEoBoiyZHo9hKA4qcSAN2hr.jpg","credit_id":"59d4ebd29251414b45018133","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margarida Rêgo","original_name":"Margarida Rêgo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4ebda9251414b8b0184ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margarida Rêgo","original_name":"Margarida Rêgo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4ea489251414b45017f31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3733094","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mD5GtHFbL2qLdGEesqlYQVBwkr1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wkQNUPkme35htev1qTFVUuJ5e3t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
