Surviving Peace questions why Israelis and Palestinians, innovative in every other field of endeavor, suffer stagnation when it comes to making peace. Policy makers and common people are tasked to examine the 70 year impasse between Israel and Palestine, the viability of either the two state solution or a one state solution, and whether confederation could be a way forward.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aNNAwWm4CIn8UpE22gZiQIcXd71.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surviving Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900083,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josef Avesar","original_name":"Josef Avesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d541c49251414ba501e537","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Avesar","original_name":"Josef Avesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d541ca9251414b8301e1a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Fredricks","original_name":"Charles Fredricks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d541d3c3a368452801dddf","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4975304","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aNNAwWm4CIn8UpE22gZiQIcXd71.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54DjWy0dmQyIYn8XamTOBcs4hgu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":692}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
