This sort of proto-film was born not as a film, but as a photograph; I caused it to transmigrate—using a horizontal scanning motion of the filmstrip typical of photo-finish—into a film, thus betraying its natural verticality. I rephotographed the photofinish negative through the gate of an old 35mm moviecamera causing it to advance using the crank handle at a velocity interpolated between the crank handle [of the old 35mm moviecamera] and that of my own [16mm] movie camera. I was interested in seeing figures transformed which had been destined to remain motionless and to see them reanimated.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/spTFk1PpmepbmLVpcU3HAfzmTy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extremotions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Gioli","original_name":"Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/mA2Q0SwP0Wk56hRNNCQDeKNSFdE.jpg","credit_id":"59d35cdf92514140af00d352","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/spTFk1PpmepbmLVpcU3HAfzmTy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
