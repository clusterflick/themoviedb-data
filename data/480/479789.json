Through their words, their work, questioning also history and cinema, a truth is revealed : trains create links, trains \"make society\". But today this historical movement of building a network and a community is being questioned. Managerial culture is taking over from railway culture. The change is profound among rail workers. At the time when the world of work tends to hide from outside eyes, where words and images are henceforth \"under the control\" of company management, the rail workers question, express their doubts and hopes.","popularity":0.0625,"poster_path":"/vzuUpJ7lpDRLiqGO0410sr8dGv2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheminots","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Joulé","original_name":"Luc Joulé","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"59d7a00f925141252c010944","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Joulé","original_name":"Luc Joulé","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7a025925141251f011612","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Jousse","original_name":"Sébastien Jousse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7a0349251412505010811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1747970","wikidata_id":"Q21008208","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vzuUpJ7lpDRLiqGO0410sr8dGv2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
