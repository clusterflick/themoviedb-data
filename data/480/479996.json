Many know the unique tragedy of this disease, but few know that Alzheimer's is one of the most critical public health crises facing America. Because of the growing number of aging baby boomers, and the fact that the onset of Alzheimer's is primarily age-related, the number of Alzheimer's case is predicted to skyrocket in the United States. This will not only be a profound human tragedy, but an overwhelming economic one as well. Due to the length of time people live with the illness and need care, it's the most expensive medical condition in the U.S. Future costs for Alzheimer's threaten to bankrupt Medicare, Medicaid, and the life savings of millions of Americans.","popularity":0.7548,"poster_path":"/fJhUbxa9L5RBtmzf8gILFnsDl6Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141754,"logo_path":null,"name":"TPT National Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":152981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gurney Street Films","origin_country":""},{"id":24982,"logo_path":"/7QEPsLccAEMQBksE9bgJSycH6A.png","name":"Twin Cities Public Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The National Threat Posed by an Incurable Illness","title":"Alzheimer's: Every Minute Counts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257869,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Arledge","original_name":"Elizabeth Arledge","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"607f0e8c713ed40058dbba23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Markey","original_name":"Ed Markey","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/wOGNRrOdyNLpl7tLTBVk964Ywx9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608190dbf92532005a9cdafa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3063345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Collins","original_name":"Susan Collins","popularity":0.2759,"profile_path":"/b8vn0BReFBZtsCy1zcQ6Muf1MIr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60819120126ec3003f239d04","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karinna Sjo-Gaber","original_name":"Karinna Sjo-Gaber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607f0e2666f2d20040b72922","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451055,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben McCoy","original_name":"Ben McCoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607f0e38160e73005836d3cc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927879,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Pawlak","original_name":"Jason Pawlak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607f0e45e6d3cc00584d92be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257869,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Arledge","original_name":"Elizabeth Arledge","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607f0c13713ed4002934abb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257869,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Arledge","original_name":"Elizabeth Arledge","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607f0c04aa659e0057effdd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451058,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John E.
