They were initially active from 1978 to 1995 with basically this line-up. Named after the J. G. Ballard short story. They debuted in 1979 with the \"Red Planet\" three-track single. This release attracted Polydor A&R man Frank Neilson and the band signed a three-album recording contract. These three albums - \"Waiting for a Miracle\" (1980), which included the single \"Independence Day\", probably their best known song, \"Sleep No More\" (1981) and \"Fiction\" (1982) - are regarded by some as their best, but only sold modestly.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/pyArsZVNlLzFhWTrdofCiLogcYs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polydor Ltd.","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Comsat Angels Live 12-12-1981","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Fellows","original_name":"Stephen Fellows","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Vocals, Guitar","credit_id":"59d8a805c3a368624d022ce9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mik Glaisher","original_name":"Mik Glaisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Drums","credit_id":"59d8a81a92514124c9023e98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1901628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Bacon","original_name":"Kevin Bacon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Bass","credit_id":"59d8a82b925141251f024a7d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Peake","original_name":"Andy Peake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Keyboards","credit_id":"59d8a83cc3a36861df0265b0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Wilson","original_name":"Peter Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d8a87a925141250502329a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7470112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pyArsZVNlLzFhWTrdofCiLogcYs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
