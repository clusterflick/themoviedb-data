This super-sized tomb has fascinated historians and archaeologists for centuries, but exactly how the ancient Egyptians finished the monument and fitted its two and a half million blocks in a quarter of a century has long remained an enigma. Today the secrets of the pyramid are finally being revealed thanks to a series of new findings. At the foot of the monument, archaeologists are uncovering the last surviving relic of the pharaoh Khufu, whose tomb it is: a huge ceremonial boat buried in flat-pack form for more than 4500 years. It's a clue that points to the important role that ships and water could have played in the pyramids' construction. This documentary follows investigations that reveal how strong the link between pyramids and boats is. It's a story of more than how Egypt built a pyramid: it's about how the pyramid helped build the modern world.","popularity":0.6703,"poster_path":"/2fFMt9blcw3RxqKdmWGoGXTa7A4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8635,"logo_path":"/sNC3eCDuMbNhRCevAUIYbblJOjO.png","name":"Windfall Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":153817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alibi Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mystery has long surrounded the construction of Egypt's Great Pyramid.","title":"Egypt's Great Pyramid: The New Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Secrets du papyrus de Merer : Les Bateaux du pharaon","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Secrets du papyrus de Merer : Voyage sur le Nil","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les secrets de la grande pyramide : Les bateaux du pharaon","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les secrets de la grande pyramide : Voyage sur le Nil","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Lost Secrets of the Pyramids","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McGann","original_name":"Paul McGann","popularity":0.7532,"profile_path":"/4NAtQI30CAaJuQRiot9twe7J9t9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60925123168ea3002bd04a30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3079728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eissa Zidan","original_name":"Eissa Zidan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
