Do fluorescent lights cause cancer and childhood learning and behavior disorders? Can long-term exposure to low-level radiation as from TV sets, computers, fluorescent lights, and similar devices harm you? Does living behind window glass and with glasses covering our eyes over years affect our health? Is natural sunlight and trace ultra-violet radiation really harmful? Or is it necessary and beneficial? How do cells, plants, and animals respond to constant exposure to different light color frequencies? These and similar questions were the subjects of Dr. Ott's pioneering investigations in the field of photobiology, using the methods of time-lapse photography.","popularity":1.6355,"poster_path":"/hw69otCsdtIoAeWTI2eEGrKoXz0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95775,"logo_path":null,"name":"Henry Ott Films","origin_country":""},{"id":95776,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Ott Pictures Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Effects of Natural and Artificial Light on Living Organisms","title":"Exploring the Spectrum","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Nash Ott","original_name":"John Nash Ott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wu42mszG3WH7ZkOEapLNvP5BedZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59d5caa9c3a368321700a023","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Nash Ott","original_name":"John Nash Ott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wu42mszG3WH7ZkOEapLNvP5BedZ.jpg","credit_id":"622e8924a6fdaa001b7e5f10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Nash Ott","original_name":"John Nash Ott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wu42mszG3WH7ZkOEapLNvP5BedZ.jpg","credit_id":"59d474f99251414b8b00f820","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Nash Ott","original_name":"John Nash Ott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wu42mszG3WH7ZkOEapLNvP5BedZ.jpg","credit_id":"59d5cabe9251417f7f009c17","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hw69otCsdtIoAeWTI2eEGrKoXz0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bEsSVhz7ifspdDjB5ewmlQETVgL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3760,"name":"light"},{"id":3721,"name":"health"},{"id":174440,"name":"time lapse photography"},{"id":237122,"name":"ultraviolet light"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"John Nash Ott Clip 1 - time lapse effect of various light frequency on humans and animals","key":"msTj3N_oa0o","published_at":"2016-03-20T05:13:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"59d5d0a2c3a368324a009245"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"John Ott - Exploring the Spectrum  www.naturalenergyworks.net","key":"bw6hcTGND3c","published_at":"2009-04-17T08:31:04.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"59d5cf7c9251417f5c009df5"}]}}}
