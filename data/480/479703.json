A story involving a love that disappears because of the lack of understanding one another. A friendship that goes beyond all the difficulties that arise along the way. Emotion through simple situations, recognizable people, that we can find in any city in the world. A blind pizzaiolo, of Italian descent, an Argentine, from a wealthy Jewish family and a friend, the waiter, who becomes the 'eyes of the pizzaiolo.' Within this familiar environment, the story told is about the lack of understanding that exists in our world today. This is not a typical Brazilian story or from a specific place, it is a story of our time about individualism, about respect for what the other desires.","popularity":0.231,"poster_path":"/sQl8mvS9Q8cNBldaZ0MBO9e4yse.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17680,"logo_path":"/7RtrfAVWgne5MRgXl8O3oD6Ncom.png","name":"Accorde Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2018-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your World Isn't For My Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edson Celulari","original_name":"Edson Celulari","popularity":0.1532,"profile_path":"/6vwdsO3wG26DatBgkVyPY9OjnDL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Vitório","credit_id":"59d6d90a92514124eb002e3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soledad Villamil","original_name":"Soledad Villamil","popularity":0.4812,"profile_path":"/gDjw5xPPlqOtD8hXCvSQilWBJ1Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Clarice","credit_id":"59d6d91a925141252c002d57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1486793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovana Echeverria","original_name":"Giovana Echeverria","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/11nIeeL2WjgF8UiED5uRcqk1me.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alicia","credit_id":"59d6d92ec3a36861df003384","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Machado","original_name":"Leonardo Machado","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/oydGQyL6PHPRIeEyQXXBtCkhLm2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cleomar","credit_id":"59d6d93dc3a368623e002f85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Birindelli","original_name":"Roberto Birindelli","popularity":0.1273,"profile_path":"/xrd8LiUFgOxYINEqgaFVUjXoXP2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Jantzen","credit_id":"59d6d94d925141252c002d8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Cunha","original_name":"Carlos Cunha","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Italian","credit_id":"59d6d96fc3a368623e002fc7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zé Victor Castiel","original_name":"Zé Victor Castiel","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/m1uWM5doOXVu12LNu9WOogxoEmt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Customer","credit_id":"59d6d97e925141252c002db5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680056,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcio Papel","original_name":"Marcio Papel","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d6d9e392514124cd003272","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":963972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Nascimento","original_name":"Paulo Nascimento","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d6d99dc3a36861df0033f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":963972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Nascimento","original_name":"Paulo Nascimento","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d6d9bf92514124c5003127","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900745,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roberto Laguna","original_name":"Roberto Laguna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d6d9d592514124c5003147","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5725568","wikidata_id":"Q28678047","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvEyw8ohC1x682TghzJOygx4SLG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/sQl8mvS9Q8cNBldaZ0MBO9e4yse.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/qsjWVCXuvPBl6xAOvWy9CUdxNoe.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":807,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/nvKyCIHGEi5hXDnOXH10fLeZTae.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
