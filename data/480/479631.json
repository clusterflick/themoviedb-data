Their everyday life is determined by an attempt to ward off everything modern, a life without electricity, machines and communicative media, a school whose only books are the Bible and the Catechism. Nora Fingscheidt takes this life in the eye and lets it be told by those who live it - in different degrees of devotion. In the process, it is not least apparent how a life-style, which has devoted itself entirely to the departure from this \"world,\" is formed around it. And then, between the pictures and the words, a gap opens, in which the longing for a more destitute life, as well as the fear of a sad departure, becomes perceptible.","popularity":0.1083,"poster_path":"/gzYyJoGf00gNlYdOgSgQKzMuamQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without This World","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nora Fingscheidt","original_name":"Nora Fingscheidt","popularity":0.2834,"profile_path":"/wjf96BGhggmdxiZVxOVJzWWVoq0.jpg","credit_id":"59d611f7c3a368323c00e0fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1900277,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yunus Roy Imer","original_name":"Yunus Roy Imer","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d61223c3a368320600f5d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7937070","wikidata_id":"Q60740637","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":801,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gzYyJoGf00gNlYdOgSgQKzMuamQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
