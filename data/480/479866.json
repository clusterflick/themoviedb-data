It was the largest, most comprehensive survey of Koons’s art ever assembled, spanning four decades of his career and displaying 145 works from every series, including 13 new pieces exhibited publicly for the first time.  The film follows Koons and Whitney Chief Curator, Scott Rothkopf, who conceived and organized the show, through every gallery of the exhibition. In addition, insightful interviews with Adam Weinberg, the Whitney’s Director, Robert Storr, Dean Emeritus of the Yale School of Art, and Michelle Kuo, Editor of Artforum, help to deepen the investigation into Koon’s art and process.","popularity":0.1125,"poster_path":"/h0GGMfcetzjYPQFp6RNfLrjA1Bd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Checkerboard Film Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeff Koons: The Whitney Retrospective","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Koons","original_name":"Jeff Koons","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/omhHKQPGdsnZ1clyX4k1x3gfu38.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59d83160925141250501bbf9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Howard","original_name":"Edgar Howard","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d8316f92514124cd01ce15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Wald","original_name":"Susan Wald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebc0411c3514c002063809e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h0GGMfcetzjYPQFp6RNfLrjA1Bd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1054}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
