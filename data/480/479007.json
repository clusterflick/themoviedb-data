A daredevil ad extremis, Clarke-Jones learned to tackle and surmount some of the most mammoth waves on the face of the Earth. And that attitude fittingly mirrors the surfer's approach to life, colored and shaped by an insatiable restlessness and a hunger for new thrills. His drive transported him from one exotic corner of the world to another, Tasmania to the Amazon and everywhere in between. This documentary tells Clarke-Jones's amazing story, with insights from heavyweights including Jeff Bushman, Matt Hoy, Noah Johnson, Jamie Brisick, Kelly Slater and many others. The late Dennis Hopper narrates.","popularity":0.3266,"poster_path":"/6BgwLDADOFUMEgwmSefTEG5JCyw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westlake Entertainment Incorporated","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sixth Element: The Ross Clarke-Jones Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie R.
