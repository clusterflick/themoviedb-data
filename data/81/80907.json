Jannings stars as famed operatic singer Albert Winkelmann, who is greeted with cheers, applause and romantic propositions whenever he performs in his native Vienna. But when he embarks on a tour of South America, tragedy strikes. The sweltering climate causes Winkelmann to lose his voice on stage, a disaster met with hoots and cat-calls. Dispirited he returns to Europe, where he soon learns that no one is aware of what happened in South America. Intending to retire so as not to be exposed to further humiliation, Winkelmann is goaded back on stage -- where, miraculously, his gorgeous voice returns.","popularity":0.4072,"poster_path":"/e8OeJ98sjWJM626h6kjHvNp2StH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darling
