Quickly arrested for murder and jailed, Beauchamp insists he's innocent and asks the town's most prominent lawyer, Gavin Stevens, to defend him, but Stevens refuses. When a local boy whom Beauchamp has helped in the past and who believes him to be innocent hears talk of a mob taking Beauchamp out of jail and lynching him, he pleads with Stevens to defend Beauchamp at trial and prove his innocence.","popularity":1.1675,"poster_path":"/upQaoMXJhglvPhsYXEDatTLiBXy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's Sensational!","title":"Intruder in the Dust","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":40,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Han matado un hombre blanco","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brian","original_name":"David Brian","popularity":0.2847,"profile_path":"/i0dBYGdduoSxCpZZAshICAWuGIg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Gavin Stevens","credit_id":"52fe47c89251416c9107596f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Jarman Jr.","original_name":"Claude Jarman Jr.","popularity":0.2602,"profile_path":"/oPQCGgpWUjLgd7XpHKrMGYCjZFP.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Chick Mallison","credit_id":"52fe47c89251416c91075983","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juano Hernández","original_name":"Juano Hernández","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/ylo9FMmXNff7lnUezh8bEPKhNR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lucas Beauchamp","credit_id":"52fe47c89251416c91075977","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Porter Hall","original_name":"Porter Hall","popularity":0.45,"profile_path":"/249Hlfx23i69MsA3rLnC185kbwT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nub Gowrie","credit_id":"52fe47c89251416c91075973","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Patterson","original_name":"Elizabeth Patterson","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":"/rSLcM8DsZi1ydRn8Dk3vXE89nCG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Miss Eunice Habersham","credit_id":"52fe47c89251416c9107597b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Kemper","original_name":"Charles Kemper","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/ju4jjihVMT9BVoeYjT3hWM2rACX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Crawford Gowrie","credit_id":"52fe47c89251416c9107597f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Geer","original_name":"Will Geer","popularity":0.448,"profile_path":"/lpiuWaZxn0dov4FoYE6fxtsee8c.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sheriff Hampton","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c91075987","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Clarke","original_name":"David Clarke","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/zCfjBbGWzco0K7IaDDAYlWJXOYl.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Vinson Gowrie","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c9107598b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elzie Emanuel","original_name":"Elzie Emanuel","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/xDNIdSjHf8HdHYHqqRglg3vPV8w.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Aleck","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c9107598f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lela Bliss","original_name":"Lela Bliss","popularity":0.2423,"profile_path":"/4z9HblAM7UCYakqgcFU9gYEMIAI.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Mrs. Mallison","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c91075993","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hayden","original_name":"Harry Hayden","popularity":0.2379,"profile_path":"/4ZcgltqUHz0A3W9rKKERAC8KCsg.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Mr. Mallison","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c91075997","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Antrim","original_name":"Harry Antrim","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/rmOLsYDNZCKbqvMd5AMdwxE7icw.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Mr. Tubbs","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c9107599b","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Homer Arnold","original_name":"Homer Arnold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":30,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"5dd8d036ef8b3200148d126f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John E.
