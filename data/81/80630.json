Appointing himself protector of all Gulf of Mexico gamefish, Capt. Casewell makes it his mission to round up illegal fishing boats and to stave off such natural predators as sharks, whales and octopi. This may well be the only American film in which a school of dolphins are depicted as \"the enemy.\" Beyond its rather ludicrous continuity, the film offers several spectacular underwater scenes, as Casewell battles invading sea life with knife and harpoon. This 49-minute documentary was narrated by Lowell Thomas.","popularity":0.1013,"poster_path":"/7wzB04CKH1vzBMbLMGF4q3AFHlr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"See THE MAN OF STEEL - CONQUEROR OF SEA MONSTERS!","title":"Killers of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lowell Thomas","original_name":"Lowell Thomas","popularity":0.2521,"profile_path":"/TOttKij84BgoE6CmKZqJuvlrYF.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076631","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Caswell Jr. ","original_name":"Wallace Caswell Jr. ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself (as Captain Wallace Caswell Jr.)","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076635","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"'Evolution' Henderson","original_name":"'Evolution' Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076639","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"'Spot' Hayes","original_name":"'Spot' Hayes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c9107663d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Dykes","original_name":"Hubert Dykes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076641","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Stillwell","original_name":"Bruce Stillwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076645","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Beadon ","original_name":"Steve Beadon ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076649","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryant Lee ","original_name":"Bryant Lee ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c9107664d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Randy ","original_name":"Julius Randy ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c91076651","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Friedgen","original_name":"Raymond Friedgen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47cf9251416c9107662d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick H.
