Anna refuses Yasha's offer of marriage and he therefore runs off to Siberia. After Pavel is hailed as a hero because he survives a fire accident in factory (which is in fact effect of his sabotage), Anna marries him. Pavel then becomes a reckless communist careerist, but only on surface. In fact, he is a traitor of the country and a spy, and gives Anna's party ID card to anti-communist movement. In spite of that, Anna is expelled from the communist party. Yasha returns from Siberia, only to find her love Anna desperate. They reveal the truth about Pavel (that he is a kulak who killed a kolchoz co-op leader), which means an end for Pavel.","popularity":0.4438,"poster_path":"/6pLIJuihNrwF8ZPzjTBEq3VzNgA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1936-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Anna","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Party Membership Card","type":"Literal English Title Translation"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Partiynyy Bilet","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ada Vojtsik","original_name":"Ada Vojtsik","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/nxO6MFjcrjr9VJVClgnoruGKymE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe47a19251416c91070adf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Abrikosov","original_name":"Андрей Абрикосов","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/iFyogTnPJ108HGY87Qyf5NLQAas.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pavel Kurganov","credit_id":"52fe47a19251416c91070ad3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoli Goryunov","original_name":"Анатолий Горюнов","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/r2BSnx2U787lkejeAr067HK5kZ5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fyodor Ivanovich","credit_id":"52fe47a19251416c91070ad7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Maleyev","original_name":"Igor Maleyev","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/qmnP57SSwEzAwpH4a8dHLriBwk8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yasha","credit_id":"52fe47a19251416c91070adb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Novoseltsev","original_name":"Ivan Novoseltsev","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/cOSXrwxPtxhOYjLCnxsE6grrhgZ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Chekist","credit_id":"642fd7b1e92d83011306e3ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":674355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Antimonov","original_name":"Sergei Antimonov","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/v6c5WLu1rzsjuttoF7M6den8uCk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Philip Maksimovich Kulikov, Anna's father (uncredited)","credit_id":"5b6de57592514103410570cc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Uralskiy","original_name":"Владимир Уральский","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":"/zcX8uW3LxVvsOS4vVIpdIU4THNz.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Meeting Participant","credit_id":"6539b95a67825900adffc6d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Yarotskaya","original_name":"Mariya Yarotskaya","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/cHYGu18h5R7jqvwnMPknHcAW05Y.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Varvara Polikarpovna","credit_id":"642fd7f595c0af00f4c4dbc9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1513417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inna Fyodorova","original_name":"Инна Федорова","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/6pj6zzDdm5vDBrU9MkdcEB7EXoO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tanya","credit_id":"5b6de51792514168b60c0f61","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Alekseev","original_name":"Leonid Alekseev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Meeting Participant","credit_id":"642fd7686dea3a0096db836c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Bobrov","original_name":"Ivan Bobrov","popularity":0.1875,"profile_path":"/yCHbMMtSGOYzn5O7FfaTncYsSBw.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Kuganov's Brother","credit_id":"642fd77fe92d830097c4dc0d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3998558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ye.
