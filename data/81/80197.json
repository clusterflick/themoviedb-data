Eusebio Luquin, a police inspector who never loses any sleep over his work, is asked to solve, along with his new detective, Fermín, the rape and murder of a young woman near the army barracks. The army, however, offers them little support in their investigations. Nevertheless, a recent photograph of the victim uncovers a vital clue, and the prime suspect turns out to be the husband of Elvira, a kitchen worker at the barracks. But just as it appears that everything has been resolved, a shocking series of events re-opens a case in which it seems some people are keen to keep quiet while the rest are keen that no questions are asked.","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":"/uXnqMcnXn2I5JHPf1x0PcWaBtR4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muertos comunes","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Albalá","original_name":"Javier Albalá","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/p9vOw5Rpjftx5PtIsp31VOsNjzv.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe47ad9251416c91072111","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Alterio","original_name":"Ernesto Alterio","popularity":0.6489,"profile_path":"/syV3VAQgQi72fvoQyQ4t1yBx9we.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe47ad9251416c91072115","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2247468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luchi López","original_name":"Luchi López","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/slktPERdYNws9a1KtSAmToEGHon.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"5d589aa68d2f8d0016491ec8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norberto Ramos del Val","original_name":"Norberto Ramos del Val","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/pG0XN8zBmb3hPWD2yDEHtQ2WSia.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47ad9251416c9107210d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":572453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Javier Echániz","original_name":"Javier Echániz","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657847f420ecaf0100d28393","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0414290","wikidata_id":"Q124295507","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":916,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/uXnqMcnXn2I5JHPf1x0PcWaBtR4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer Muertos Comunes-2F.mov","key":"LH09CSpvBjA","published_at":"2009-07-11T12:40:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6cbc3a36854480074ab"}]}}}
