He is also the gonzo performer Blowfly, Clarence's freaky alter ego and the original X-rated rapper. \"The Weird World of Blowfly\" explores both sides of this hilarious and controversial artist, providing a rare, inside peek at the infamous linguist's daily life. Now 69-years-old, with a gold-spangled superhero costume and a catalog of the world's raunchiest tunes, Blowfly tours the world, still struggling for success and recognition after 50 years of making music. The film highlights both Clarence's and Blowfly's unique contributions to music history, including Top-10 R&B hits and what might be the world's first rap song, recorded in 1965.","popularity":0.7212,"poster_path":"/pZi7OBBqFiSMpLoL3ZfciRUGbAa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-16","revenue":3062,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weird World of Blowfly","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Reid","original_name":"Clarence Reid","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Blowfly","credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Bell","original_name":"Greg Bell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jello Biafra","original_name":"Jello Biafra","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/ddoHZlkbI9WbimJRjIigwfQDlMm.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck D","original_name":"Chuck D","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/bKUsmjaGJYqKF0iRmKrGfTbxJ2W.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norwood Fisher","original_name":"Norwood Fisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733eb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ice-T","original_name":"Ice-T","popularity":1.4086,"profile_path":"/96TdPckI16ggfHcPrSFf6bHYLLe.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733ef","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589191,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Furmanski","original_name":"Jonathan Furmanski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47b69251416c910733d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587184,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cy Christiansen","original_name":"Cy Christiansen","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db42c64d2c0c1001b107b55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589191,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Furmanski","original_name":"Jonathan Furmanski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db42c6dd2c0c1001810250d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1603489","wikidata_id":"Q16170614","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pZi7OBBqFiSMpLoL3ZfciRUGbAa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gent International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2010-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Weird World of Blowfly Trailer (2011) HD","key":"UCOBGotTMmM","published_at":"2011-08-25T22:46:58.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6ccc3a36854480074e3"}]}}}
