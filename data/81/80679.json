This ensemble cast of characters includes an Iraq War vet returned home to an emotionally disturbed wife, a new father living in the shadow of a successful older brother, a sister caught up in a web of addiction, and a cameraman who attempts to exploit the reality behind all of their stories, or at least his version of them. The search for truth becomes a life and death struggle as the subtle manipulation of all relationships is exposed.","popularity":0.4397,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everybody uses everybody","title":"In/Significant Others","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Cooper","original_name":"Angela Cooper","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Elizabeth","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c910772ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun O'Rourke","original_name":"Shaun O'Rourke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Boyfriend","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c910772f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burgess Jenkins","original_name":"Burgess Jenkins","popularity":0.2541,"profile_path":"/tLuduvqouKKaGpSbq5npmUGCAvX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bruce Snow","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c910772f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":289250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Montgomery","original_name":"Tiffany Montgomery","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/7nzEjTnGXaHjAvK91OBuGR2b4ub.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Salem Snow","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c910772f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Powell","original_name":"Andrea Powell","popularity":0.3007,"profile_path":"/cDqn66JG5kz2YEyh7VYvqEjLcr5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Christina Ludum","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c910772fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Lafontaine","original_name":"Brian Lafontaine","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/nR68GlbxFPQqqhBRgZWkL7vFZ6b.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jack Rizzo","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c91077301","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashlee Payne","original_name":"Ashlee Payne","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Leslie Rizzo","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c91077305","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen McGinty","original_name":"Gretchen McGinty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Joanne","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c91077309","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aerli Austen","original_name":"Aerli Austen","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":"/akUjgnCtILJ0sm0aU1xKW9gGQJh.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c9107730d","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schwert","original_name":"John Schwert","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c91077319","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schwert","original_name":"John Schwert","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c91077313","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angela Cooper","original_name":"Angela Cooper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47d59251416c910772e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1690419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Moody","original_name":"David Moody","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f6e77a92514111d100087c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1217259","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
