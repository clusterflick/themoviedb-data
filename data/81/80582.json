His travels take him from Alaska to Mexico with stops in San Diego, New York, Japan, Holland and Spain. In the end, he presents the testimonies of patients, scientists, surgeons and nutritionists who testify to the therapy s efficacy in curing cancer and other degenerative diseases, and presents the hard scientific proof to back up their claims. Testimonies include: a Japanese medical school professor who cured himself of liver cancer over 15 years ago, a lymphoma patient who was diagnosed as terminal over 50 years ago as well as from noted critics of this world-renowned healing method who dismiss it out of hand as pure quackery. So the question that remains is, Why is this powerful curative therapy still suppressed, more than 75 years after it was clearly proven to cure degenerative diseases?","popularity":0.5846,"poster_path":"/mjTM0IVaj8g4QnmTFnJIFxjfEhf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The evidence behind natural healing","title":"Dying To Have Known","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Gerson","original_name":"Charlotte Gerson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Dr. Gerson's Daughter","credit_id":"52fe47c99251416c91075a57","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Barret","original_name":"Stephen Barret","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Health Fraud Expert","credit_id":"5c5bba3d0e0a2627a7647bf8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
