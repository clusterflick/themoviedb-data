Two angry young men beat two young women to death, seemingly without any particular reason. The years passed but the images in our heads did not disappear. We tried to forget it, wrote screenplay after screenplay, but we always came back to those murders, and to telling the story about a part of Sweden that we never read about in newspapers, and that is

village.","popularity":0.1023,"poster_path":"/pTlQsmwVwceF7d5xBz7r83G9Yyi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2011-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savage","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Udyret","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Vadember","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf
