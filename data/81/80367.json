Director Steve Metze examines several different groups including historical miniature gamers, role-players, and those known simply as \"LARPers.\" The film also explores opposition from religious groups, negative media portrayals, and some of the meanest 'man-on-the-street' interviews ever committed to video. Meet the Gamers, learn their exotic language, see their bizarre rituals, gasp at their semi-authentic costumes, and thrill to the painting techniques on their miniatures!","popularity":0.8919,"poster_path":"/vvnndRXsMgqecjT7gQnHZtWRuvC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about gamers","title":"Über Goober","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218317,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Gygax","original_name":"Gary Gygax","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/kRfA8qAu9dJNqXGuAN6941tQh9B.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ad746a79251413b3a00ebe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Sienkowski","original_name":"Luke Sienkowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ad746ca9251413b3100ea43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Smith","original_name":"Rob Smith","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ad747450e0a2674c700e419","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Becca Smith","original_name":"Becca Smith","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ad74752c3a36847e400e11f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Viverito","original_name":"Phil Viverito","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ad747c00e0a2674c700e4b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kovalic","original_name":"John Kovalic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ad748049251413b3100ebf8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Metze","original_name":"Steve Metze","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad745f4c3a368480b00e387","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Metze","original_name":"Steve Metze","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad746780e0a2674d800d04c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Metze","original_name":"Steve Metze","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad745ff0e0a2674be00d218","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1852125,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"David Hobizal","original_name":"David Hobizal","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad7464c9251413b3700ed22","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092597,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Don Swaynos","original_name":"Don Swaynos","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad746140e0a2674be00d22e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092597,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Don Swaynos","original_name":"Don Swaynos","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad7466a9251413b2d00eaeb","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0386836","wikidata_id":"Q8079428","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vvnndRXsMgqecjT7gQnHZtWRuvC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5800,"name":"geek"},{"id":10090,"name":"board game"},{"id":18249,"name":"game"},{"id":237725,"name":"miniatures"},{"id":280322,"name":"larp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
