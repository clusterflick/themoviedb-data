To entertain and inspire his fellow prisoners, he tells the story of becoming a man in 1919, the year he realized that learning to live is the same as learning to die. His stiff and demanding father loses a fortune in German war bonds, takes a job in Caspe, and leaves José on his own in Zaragoza to finish high school while apprenticing in a pharmacy. José courts his beloved Valentina via letters, becomes intimate with Isabel, a maid he meets in a cinema who shares his ideas of free love, and comes under the influence of El Checa, an anarchist and gentle teacher who leads a doomed revolt.","popularity":0.1388,"poster_path":"/iGvGmLmhpTaW7gwEPBBRSKuqwLF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1919, Chronicle of Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Molina","original_name":"Miguel Molina","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/x2nmTfsnLGYRkpRDWH2O9JPyozG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"José Garcés","credit_id":"52fe47a89251416c91071659","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Marsillach","original_name":"Cristina Marsillach","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/aUukv8ju77BVSrxD8I9Y3C2hsHg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"52fe47a89251416c9107165d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Vidarte","original_name":"Walter Vidarte","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/4U3F5M9dV4BFqaSpgi6QDIOSCm9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe47a89251416c91071661","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Betancourt","original_name":"Antonio Betancourt","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Letux","credit_id":"57f57412c3a36861b100092d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio José Betancor","original_name":"Antonio José Betancor","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47a89251416c91071655","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085123","wikidata_id":"Q5651037","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/20RRKDeAuMEtym4vS08bxL3cMXA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OrJO1v94uFCpovT4wFpYS5taDd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/iGvGmLmhpTaW7gwEPBBRSKuqwLF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":897,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/mzX1FhrocDiv0WxPBggll2wIx0l.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":634}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
