He seeks sanctuary from all of his troubles in the open air, in the company of wolves and particularly in the presence of a young wolf whose life he has saved.","popularity":2.1068,"poster_path":"/899mbVyNAEsCWQ9wHpafxi2DbWy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time of the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Boy from Wolf Mountain","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burt Reynolds","original_name":"Burt Reynolds","popularity":2.2955,"profile_path":"/5FNuc4f1OR9EF9QcrcnFIr3zZQr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Archie McGregor","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078a8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Keller","original_name":"Marthe Keller","popularity":0.79,"profile_path":"/zRSAz0UNz5AS7B1tdizwZyodXnx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rebecca McGregor","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078a91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devin Douglas Drewitz","original_name":"Devin Douglas Drewitz","popularity":0.2387,"profile_path":"/gRncxJyRD3S802KpB9YFXQWtgMc.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"64b00b25d6590b013ba4e1aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Priestley","original_name":"Jason Priestley","popularity":1.1064,"profile_path":"/lQvkOOhf59FTD86G96fTRp17VJt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Nelson","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078a95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Neville","original_name":"John Neville","popularity":0.354,"profile_path":"/q9dqdcETh7fejWKYpIRz1tWnkN3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Preacher","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078a99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Kerr","original_name":"Jamie Kerr","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Josh Grossler","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078a9d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1874936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Taylor","original_name":"Steven Taylor","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Freddy McGuire","credit_id":"64b00d1c8a0e9b00adad00f8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":265904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Arnold","original_name":"Charlotte Arnold","popularity":0.1829,"profile_path":"/3nmxOt2BqULjVer8OpL1FYTleHR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Paige McGuire","credit_id":"64b00d9ee24b935b31ca61a7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Lemke","original_name":"Anthony Lemke","popularity":0.5031,"profile_path":"/yR9mpiDDczUt6RlXntWwq49yacm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Alex McKenzie","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078aa1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fraser McGregor","original_name":"Fraser McGregor","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Arty Bower","credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078aa5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Garrow","original_name":"Patrick Garrow","popularity":0.9359,"profile_path":"/gWu8E3zYnwBVa5zTZzQP3JO1uLI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. McGuire","credit_id":"610394b88a0e9b005ef93dfe","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":205082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shauna MacDonald","original_name":"Shauna MacDonald","popularity":0.4125,"profile_path":"/5gj4IibdgHZvjPMdten4gc0q67D.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Anna McKenzie","credit_id":"64e1d8e1e19de90100e94245","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":158406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rod Pridy","original_name":"Rod Pridy","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47e09251416c91078a89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lewis Chesler","original_name":"Lewis Chesler","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b6779a6aed97a50e5b044","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Commins","original_name":"Kevin Commins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b67992cb33fde35b5a82c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4701242,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas A.
