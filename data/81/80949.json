They struggled together to come up in life and settle as director and hero respectively. They delivered two consecutive hits together and are in search of a script for a 3rd film. Of the scripts sent by various story writers, Aravind finds one script to be interesting. But that script was smudged with ink after 60th page (25th scene). He summons his assistant to scout for the writer and takes Rishi for story discussions on that script to his remote wooden guesthouse located few kilometers away from the city. The scenes mentioned in the script come alive. As the things get scary, Aravind wants to see what would happen in the next scene and realize that the rest of the script is smudged by ink. The rest of the story is all about what happens next.","popularity":0.3228,"poster_path":"/6t9IaPnHiXMO5Zz5t0iy9Himbqc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Telugu","iso_639_1":"te","name":"తెలుగు"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film by Aravind","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"A Film By Arvind","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"ఎ ఫిలిమ్ బై అరవింద్","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajiv Kanakala","original_name":"Rajiv Kanakala","popularity":0.7491,"profile_path":"/29Czs1esSU744TOe3ddDzCuCa0g.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aravind","credit_id":"59a297c6c3a36847d403bc04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Rishi","original_name":"Richard Rishi","popularity":0.2582,"profile_path":"/x6TBKbp6ieXbI5nFY3EcQS5gONY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rishi","credit_id":"576cdbf1925141699c002814","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherlyn Chopra","original_name":"Sherlyn Chopra","popularity":0.4255,"profile_path":"/4QggTifJ3Tfuwvts8qsarmmfLKo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nirupama \"Niru\"","credit_id":"576cdc0d9251411540004d30","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3538389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghazal Srinivas","original_name":"Ghazal Srinivas","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Satyam","credit_id":"6274cfb15800c479b79849ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1652253,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anantha Sriram","original_name":"Anantha Sriram","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/sAa5frxlT5gv7YtXGdPY9edh0mW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Writer","credit_id":"657a93d64bfa545cff91e265","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mallikarjuna Rao","original_name":"Mallikarjuna Rao","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dhaba owner","credit_id":"64e3d63dc3c89101007aa2ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhu","original_name":"Madhu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"House keeper","credit_id":"657a94087ecd28013b3e98f2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mansoor Markhand","original_name":"Mansoor Markhand","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"657a943f7ecd2800e46d0e42","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maroju Sridhar Rao","original_name":"Maroju Sridhar Rao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657a9484564ec700feb6719d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shekar Suri","original_name":"Shekar Suri","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576cdc8992514169e20026bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Surendra Krishna","original_name":"Surendra Krishna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576cdd199251411540004da0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vijay Kurakula","original_name":"Vijay Kurakula","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576cdd3ac3a3685b540025a7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3319248","wikidata_id":"Q16057814","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A67MeP7aFFAK0bCcPpUmM3w0tYu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tOx5lq2EELz11wAIq50fyr8MbSw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"te","file_path":"/6t9IaPnHiXMO5Zz5t0iy9Himbqc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jM8HTggc0hYaeOqNdzlcwDsGgzX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"UA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
