The atmosphere of the performance is great, with the bands and fans coming together after Richey's disappearance to create a wonderful, tense, sad and beautiful mood. Musically the Manics rock out with excellent versions of 7 of their best songs to date when the video was made and 6 tracks from the aforementioned then-new album, with Elvis Impersonator and No Surface All Feeling the picks of these.","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manic Street Preachers - Everything Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Dean Bradfield","original_name":"James Dean Bradfield","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/qeWGHedzewvWOrnD2QjlvuJDeVU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58fd2991925141642f0268b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1797041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicky Wire","original_name":"Nicky Wire","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58fd29a4c3a3687a2a02472f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1797044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Moore","original_name":"Sean Moore","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5b8c1ec70e0a261d6b037d73","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q5418072","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
