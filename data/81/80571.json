Shortly after his death, war broke out in 1870. One day, his neighbor Zèphe Maloret denounces Honoré, Haudouin's son, a maverick, to the Prussians. Following this denunciation, their non-commissioned officer enters the Haudouin home and rapes the mother while Honoré is hidden under the bed. The resentment already existing between the Haudouin and Maloret families turns to hatred... A letter recalling the events is lost, which doesn't help matters.","popularity":0.5915,"poster_path":"/5rfvJUemqsxmtuSRJlPJy0xgLyK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zebra
