Mike is arrested by the police and sent to a juvenile detention center. While imprisoned, Mike meets Miu, a beautiful young woman being held for crimes she won't talk about. Together, they inadvertently discover that the warden is running a drug ring out of the detention center...and now the warden wants them dead because of what they know. Mike and Miu escape, only to learn that the local police, and even Mike's buddy Werner, are involved with drug ring.
