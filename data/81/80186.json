This is the central theme of this short animated film. Playing on imagination and humour, the director offers viewers a thought provoking piece dealing with the transition that young people between the ages of 10 and 13 experience. Inspired by the work of Escher and Magritte, Catherine Arcand has created a graphically rich film through optical illusions and trompe-l'oeil effects. Her style aptly illustra tes the theme of perceptions and is perfectly suited to conveying the dream world into which the film takes us.","popularity":0.1911,"poster_path":"/hoT4UjT8zQI46j6sYyN4ftqyf0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightmare at School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Arcand","original_name":"Catherine Arcand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab018d6590b003c219604","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normand Roger","original_name":"Normand Roger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab02aefd3c2003e9600a3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588802,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michèle Bélanger","original_name":"Michèle Bélanger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab06872a2c9003c3541bb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcel Jean","original_name":"Marcel Jean","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab072006eee003c1f7570","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087023,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michèle Bélanger","original_name":"Michèle Bélanger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab082f2cf25003bb37ac6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220020,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denis Pilon","original_name":"Denis Pilon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab04720af77004280dd2e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normand Roger","original_name":"Normand Roger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab03a283ed9003d70b04c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3085067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diane Régimbald","original_name":"Diane Régimbald","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ab05825a536003ef75b45","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Arcand","original_name":"Catherine Arcand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47ac9251416c91071e5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588971,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Arcand","original_name":"Catherine Arcand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47ac9251416c91071e63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1134616","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yva8m8gc08vw10aKgNoHdy8sPss.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hoT4UjT8zQI46j6sYyN4ftqyf0V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1265}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
