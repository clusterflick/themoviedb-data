Composer Georg Kaiser is unable to secure a divorce from his wife, so he \"lives in sin\" with his singer-sweetheart Causa. The girl's wealthy uncle dies, leaving her millions -- provided she is married to Georg Kaiser. Hoping to take advantage of a legal loophole, Georg seeks out another man named George Kaiser, intending to marry him off to Causa so that she can collect her legacy. Georg Kaiser # 2 is a middle-aged naif who can't understand why his new bride is so cold to him. When he finds out he's been duped by Kaiser #1, Kaiser #2 finds solace in the arms of another woman closer to his own age, which somehow leads to a happy ending for all concerned.","popularity":0.4054,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1931-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marriage with Limited Liability","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Causa Kaiser","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Susa","original_name":"Charlotte Susa","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/thn0iHOjN9LeRMH7kg2hwvQGV7P.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Irene Kaiser","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079ad9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Alexander","original_name":"Georg Alexander","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/uhNaGN0dnzMitrXtJSX9eOi7x5S.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Wender, Rechtsanwalt","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079add","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Morgan","original_name":"Paul Morgan","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":"/3KfIqOHdUAyhYZsf0SbpyhyBRwG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sr. Springer, Rechtsanwalt","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079ae1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Moser","original_name":"Hans Moser","popularity":0.4675,"profile_path":"/xnUAqGWMQZaFTEB9ikoP9vrUq8M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Georg Kaiser II., Bürovorsteher","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079ae5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Valetti","original_name":"Rosa Valetti","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/6FkyTtJRJJIkHQbU5G6HLnqOtms.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079ae9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Fuetterer","original_name":"Werner Fuetterer","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/k37IwazXaOOwlgsJRjF03qI4lk8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Georg Kaiser I.","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079aed","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trude Brionne","original_name":"Trude Brionne","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/83U57Zvkeeoh9cimSdqTRFnWNDE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hühnerbein","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079af1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Desni","original_name":"Tamara Desni","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":"/x3t7pAHcPXUzmHPMe6c0r4U7KFM.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079af5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Mey","original_name":"Anita Mey","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079af9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Steinbeck","original_name":"Walter Steinbeck","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zZHSgfweHKsQ8b03mZZTDAB2Rd1.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Richter","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079afd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Jürgensen","original_name":"Edwin Jürgensen","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/fmdB8uxlHmaxlCJEgThNbQUpEL3.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Kabarettdirektor","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079b01","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Dammann","original_name":"Gerhard Dammann","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":"/1QFBCnSNJH6dpt1BamdreIxSo9P.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Gerichtsdiener","credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079b05","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franz Wenzler","original_name":"Franz Wenzler","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47e89251416c91079ac9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Curt J.
