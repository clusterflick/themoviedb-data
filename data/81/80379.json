He starts with making his own kind of please-turn-off-your-cell-phone announcement, as well as a warning not to text or tweet during the show: “Just live your life,” he asks. Whether he’s talking about a unique way to drop a rental car off at an airport or describing why a man in his 40s should not smoke dope, it’s terrific, humane, carried-to-crazed-extremes stuff.","popularity":0.3764,"poster_path":"/bGntW92XqJ66EIQdBeseee1Q7Um.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pig Newton","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Circus King Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-10","revenue":1000000,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Buy The Thing","title":"Louis C.K.: Live at the Beacon Theater","video":false,"vote_average":7.822,"vote_count":233,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Louis CK Live at the Beacon Theater","type":"Proper Spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Louis CK - Live At The Beacon Theater","type":"Hyphenated"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Louis C.K. - Live at the Beacon Theater","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Louis C.K. 5: Live at the Beacon Theater","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis C.K.","original_name":"Louis C.K.","popularity":0.7021,"profile_path":"/faKr66V0EzJVMXwr0kIlSr9vfp7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c9107408b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis C.K.","original_name":"Louis C.K.","popularity":0.7021,"profile_path":"/faKr66V0EzJVMXwr0kIlSr9vfp7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c910740a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589382,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Koestner","original_name":"Paul Koestner","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c91074097","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis C.K.","original_name":"Louis C.K.","popularity":0.7021,"profile_path":"/faKr66V0EzJVMXwr0kIlSr9vfp7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c910740af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589384,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Melinda Garrett","original_name":"Melinda Garrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c910740a9","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis C.K.","original_name":"Louis C.K.","popularity":0.7021,"profile_path":"/faKr66V0EzJVMXwr0kIlSr9vfp7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c91074091","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589383,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Skidmore","original_name":"John Skidmore","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c9107409d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis C.K.","original_name":"Louis C.K.","popularity":0.7021,"profile_path":"/faKr66V0EzJVMXwr0kIlSr9vfp7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47bc9251416c910740b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2112999","wikidata_id":"Q6656601","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lJxtMpsFyWINiXqV0ZW0LgwtAWE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jxTh93QUdfhZD8SzXb40ZslvzKW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8KE0vFlBYCX0qsY31tCMPCMZ0sU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bGntW92XqJ66EIQdBeseee1Q7Um.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zCJHwMaxqo8uewyjpRzhNLeM9jw.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6TTsEi9vjVdFUJhZOAIiUm0zUrd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FX","release_date":"2012-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
