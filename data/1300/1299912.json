But when a young boy upends her tightly controlled world, she’s forced to face her own demons.  Hovering between her sparse apartment and a job at a local coffee shop, Rachael lives a sheltered life.  She keeps her head down and people at a distance. She pops pills for a shoulder injury, loud noises unsettle her, and she’s haunted by flashbacks – of a child, a lover, and a fluorescent ceiling light.  Until she meets 10-year-old Jack. He’s confident and sweet and orbits her in the hope of a new friendship. As the days pass, Rachael becomes increasingly torn between her past and her present.  AMEND is a short film exploring PTSD and grief and ultimately asks the question of whether connection is the only way through.","popularity":0.1645,"poster_path":"/6hkmQOfKzA9108nwcdkm3fJPVIh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rachael lives an isolated existence, haunted by an unspeakable past.
