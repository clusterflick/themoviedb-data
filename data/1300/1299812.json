This is The Backstreet – London's secret haven for leathermen. After 37 years in existence, the club stands on the brink of permanent closure. Facing the demolition of their erotic haven, regulars and staff recount their memories – the sweaty darkroom encounters, a master-slave couple’s first kiss, a spiritual encounter during a BDSM session, and the terror and loss of the HIV pandemic. Meanwhile, the owner, the manager and a curator from the Museum of London go through boxes, finding erotic birthday cake designs, leather jockstraps and homophobic tabloid cuttings. As the space awaits demolition, what will The Backstreet’s legacy be?","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/2aWIpAKqPPcwYxOlIo4qxde6WiF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An intimate exploration of four decades of desire, community, love and loss through the eyes of regulars at The Backstreet, an iconic London gay leather club.","title":"The Backstreet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4724796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Mead","original_name":"Matt Mead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef64720fab3d53120e9fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Romain  Beck","original_name":"Romain  Beck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef615a09ebeb935657e6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Romain  Beck","original_name":"Romain  Beck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef62b076ceeb1652347e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Romain  Beck","original_name":"Romain  Beck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef61f076ceeb1652347e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrej  Bako","original_name":"Andrej  Bako","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef660c2d308d3cbccbcfa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mandana Mohit","original_name":"Mandana Mohit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef6397c7f0a4d6a61f0dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32645022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2aWIpAKqPPcwYxOlIo4qxde6WiF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":563},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rG82DNoCadRsOK4R8NKhxqfTgEw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield DocFest","release_date":"2024-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
