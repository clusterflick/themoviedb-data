A comedy of two halves? Ariadne auf Naxos is both at once and centres around the proposal of ‘the richest man in Vienna’ to commission two entertainments, one from a serious opera composer and one from a troupe of comedians. When he discovers that sitting through both separately would delay the firework display he has planned, he gives orders for the two shows to be performed simultaneously on the same stage. The earnest young Composer is horrified while the pragmatic Zerbinetta is happy to give it a go. As a result, the story of Ariadne, abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos and despairing of her lost love, is interrupted repeatedly by the comedians, keen to help and to advise her that the best way to cure a broken heart is to find another lover.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lkP8die9zenOGXvJxhDZp0wl0b6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariadne auf Naxos - Garsington","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Romaniw","original_name":"Natalya Romaniw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"665dbecec888c0289add8356","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4752530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Young Woo Kim","original_name":"Young Woo Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"665dbee7aceaeea2242cfdce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2195246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer France","original_name":"Jennifer France","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"665dbef016d2fa696edd8200","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Leech","original_name":"Polly Leech","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"665dbefc04437d7fec81b3d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dazeley","original_name":"William Dazeley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"665dbf05e1fce87942799354","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Wigglesworth","original_name":"Mark Wigglesworth","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/8CAzOb08aEsgqkyXcnLyv9PrvDk.jpg","credit_id":"665dbf11b0bab888abdd9509","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Ravella","original_name":"Bruno Ravella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665dbf1ce107877e6e491f4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lkP8die9zenOGXvJxhDZp0wl0b6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
