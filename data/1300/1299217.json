In an exceptional television documentary, CBS News recounted the events of the flight, the official investigation, and the ongoing controversy over where responsibility lay for what took place. Producers Paul and Holly Fine painstakingly reconstructed the flight, reuniting many members of the crew and most of the passengers for a frighteningly realistic re-creation of their shared nightmare. Distinguished by its fairness, thorough attention to detail and reliance on the facts of the incident as reported by the crew and in subsequent investigations, this program is television documentary at its best. For handling an unusual subject in an informative and riveting manner, a Peabody was awarded to CBS News for The Plane That Fell From The Sky.","popularity":0.6702,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Plane That Fell From the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11116,"name":"airplane wreck"},{"id":10617,"name":"disaster"},{"id":155876,"name":"reenactment"},{"id":321969,"name":"air travel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
