It is a remake of the original Inazuma Eleven episode 27.  After defeating Zeus and becoming the Football Frontier champions, the members of Raimon return to the soccer club. Unlike episode 27, the club is not invaded by aliens. Instead, everyone congratulates the team members for their remarkable achievements.  Kidou Yuuto and Gouenji Shuuya then propose to take on the world. Hibiki Seigou comes in and, incidentially, proposes a match between Raimon and the Spanish youth league champion, Barcelona Orb.","popularity":1.6143,"poster_path":"/44o0mcVE7A6tqd4PEH70s9mo34j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5372,"logo_path":"/tPtJc2rCOTHEzJQPStT6m3dI0eK.png","name":"OLM","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":7094,"logo_path":"/tEfHdRk96nHvwB6XYiW785kquiU.png","name":"LEVEL5","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inazuma Eleven Reloaded ~Reformation of Soccer~","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded - Soccer no Henkaku","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junko Takeuchi","original_name":"竹内順子","popularity":1.4749,"profile_path":"/zNjrblq3xS1idpCsmSl5P5eTon7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mamoru Endou (voice)","credit_id":"66de8c382b54b2860e72dd7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hirofumi Nojima","original_name":"野島裕史","popularity":0.4425,"profile_path":"/55WhcKzkXRBcLl9j2tIhtraOzqq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gouenji Shuuya (voice)","credit_id":"66de8cf2d49a1f5c68346b4f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyuki Yoshino","original_name":"吉野裕行","popularity":1.1451,"profile_path":"/nZQbjjvAjPpjGYenY7kLDtW9e7N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yuuto Kidou (voice)","credit_id":"66de8d557bf7ef73fdb95dcc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1256907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akihiro Hino","original_name":"日野晃博","popularity":0.2621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fb44ad9b1f9121abd6225e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jin Iwatsuki","original_name":"岩月甚","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fb44bcd8064165bdf1622c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/44o0mcVE7A6tqd4PEH70s9mo34j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11005,"name":"prologue"},{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":41645,"name":"based on video game"},{"id":186760,"name":"alternate timeline"},{"id":193497,"name":"special"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":316205,"name":"inazuma eleven"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
