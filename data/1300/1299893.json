It's footage of an amazing trek made in 1976, high up in the Himalayas, that turned out to be a life-changing journey with irrevocable consequences. Mila's Journey follows Mila & her decision to return to India after more than 30 years. The film juxtaposes modern images with the old 8mm footage & pays homage to romance, adventure, spirituality, freedom and female independence. The film shows one Dutch woman's attempt to answer the question 'what would happen if I went back?'","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/q8zNyHG8cyAS0I1uBIHnl8HXfhp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mila's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mila Jansen","original_name":"Mila Jansen","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mila","credit_id":"665f118ce9aa57870680d6bd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Perkins","original_name":"Annie Perkins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f103120fab3d53120f075","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Perkins","original_name":"Annie Perkins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f1040c8cc8afcf6e12cdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506288,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rinku Kalsy","original_name":"Rinku Kalsy","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/ob0i2vLCLi2kqtBNhM5SSbYZ65g.jpg","credit_id":"665f1063a8616b91eaccbfe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christina Jansen","original_name":"Christina Jansen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f109e48f6b32e04549760","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506288,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rinku Kalsy","original_name":"Rinku Kalsy","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/ob0i2vLCLi2kqtBNhM5SSbYZ65g.jpg","credit_id":"665f10b60304f476fa20dce8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herman Witkam","original_name":"Herman Witkam","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f110a0535c960eb20d9ff","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487612,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Griekspoor","original_name":"Erik Griekspoor","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f112a541697b16e658277","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Augello","original_name":"Kevin Augello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f1147f4cb2e26641c34a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1803190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":834,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8zNyHG8cyAS0I1uBIHnl8HXfhp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
