From its humble beginnings as a worker’s dance, the dabke has come to represent an evolving history of cultural resistance, and is needed now more than ever. Dancing Palestine is a document of this embodiment of collective memory – as those who piece together a dabke choreography also piece together their identities. Together with the film – a performance in itself – the dabke is a testament to Palestinians’ deep love of life and an insistent act of contribution to the archive of Palestine in the present.","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":"/nKxHcEU1M3ecOfDClOMVikQAq2X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lamees Almakkawy","original_name":"Lamees Almakkawy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efd358afe3dc52f517d53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lamees Almakkawy","original_name":"Lamees Almakkawy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efd420535c960eb20d8d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754326,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grace Long Yung Yu","original_name":"Grace Long Yung Yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efd4dd3b976d97c80d9af","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754328,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ang Li","original_name":"Ang Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efd5cc7193a4816e11df6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":731,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/anIR5GIAYFcjQ5NXQPRs7mVQsrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKxHcEU1M3ecOfDClOMVikQAq2X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield DocFest","release_date":"2024-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
