A critical success, the band presented a sound that mixed post-punk with \"malandragem carioca\", but almost no one heard it. To date, there has never been a reissue and is not even available on streaming services. With interviews carried out in celebration of the twenty years since the release of this obscure success, its former members and people close to them break down the history of the band and the album.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/c3AzELypm6Kmq2yR3RdYKk2hRdl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black
