Her love for her children is at once powerful and suffocating. Shot in stark black and white, and with the camera staying within close proximity to its protagonists, the film’s minimalist approach offers a glimpse into the complex intimacies of this family. This is a film about love, fear, anxiety and the complicated emotions that emerge at their intersection.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":"/tBIek2rsPnmz21TuZadKbzp5MSh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2024-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","title":"Mėlyna","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Vijdea","original_name":"Ana Vijdea","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efac9bf8619bfe6e125cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Vijdea","original_name":"Ana Vijdea","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efad475092d23642357a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3928060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elena Martin","original_name":"Elena Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efade75092d23642357a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34385434","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tBIek2rsPnmz21TuZadKbzp5MSh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield DocFest","release_date":"2024-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Scanorama","release_date":"2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
