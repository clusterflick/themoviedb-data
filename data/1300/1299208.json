Outside, screeching seagulls are devouring a cadaver, possibly still warm. The sailor is unwell. Believe it or not, the young man had never eaten fish before until this very night. There seemed to be nothing else on the menu, so why not? In the midst of various strange companions and spectators, he starts to reminisce about home while cutting up his dinner. With an empty table as his only friend the young sailor might start losing grip of reality.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2024-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aquarium","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3775821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rune Callewaert","original_name":"Rune Callewaert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ce06b5bb58a224ecc546d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
