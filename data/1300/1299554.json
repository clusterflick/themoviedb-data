There is no social life to have but two dogs to walk and play with. The daily news streaming over mass media is neither new or useful to shut-ins, so it is best kept off. His selective memory at work and in no consecutive order, though good storytelling stuff still vivid in his diminishing memory bank which he considers worth the effort to spend 15 hours a day drawing, Sandra painting, each of us one picture at a time. The idea is to survive while remaining sane and to finish the job. One more requirement: Once done, the film must work to engage an international audience.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Vivid Than This Morning's News","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":146884,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandra Fierlinger","original_name":"Sandra Fierlinger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665dfd756691a895521f774d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Fierlinger","original_name":"Paul Fierlinger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665dfd7f0a9a30bc1f798c70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
