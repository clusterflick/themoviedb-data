The rooks have been back in Brussels for ten years now. They have had to make room for themselves among the other corvids - crows, jackdaws, magpies - and the many species that have invaded the city: peregrine falcons, parakeets, Egyptian geese, Canada geese, etc. Faced with these newcomers, city dwellers react according to their sensitivity to wild nature. Some fear for the local species and would like to chase away the intruders. Others are exasperated by the croaking and chattering. Some are pleased that the capital of Europe is home to an increasingly varied biodiversity, despite the incessant overflight of airliners.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/d5og1YOYQW4set2gucwpIbLMAv3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zistoires sprl","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruxelles Sauvage - Le retour des corbeaux","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Crutzen","original_name":"Bernard Crutzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec84446dca91b8120df78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Crutzen","original_name":"Bernard Crutzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec84f397deaeccf23534b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4549367,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Arnaud Stoumont","original_name":"Arnaud Stoumont","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec87eae111d0b34e116c6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4753979,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Olivier Taylor","original_name":"Olivier Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec8931fba280ca53df7af","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4753981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Didier Degen","original_name":"Didier Degen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec89f7c5fbbae1ce1183e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4753982,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Holland","original_name":"Pierre Holland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec8ac35da879d356582fb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2775815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Diaz Crutzen","original_name":"Pablo Diaz Crutzen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec8b7091fe9eda3b818c4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Crutzen","original_name":"Bernard Crutzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ec8c01f2129ec743df7c5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32537627","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d5og1YOYQW4set2gucwpIbLMAv3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bruxelles Sauvage, le retour des corbeaux.
