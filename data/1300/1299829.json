In a series of delicate scenes, the singers share their ideas and put their methods into practice, filling these once sad and silent spaces with a gentle comforting hubbub of hums, murmurs and intermingling voices. Through this intimate approach, the smallest of gestures – a flicker of a smile, a moment of eye contact – carry profound meaning.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/H5pmrMXhVE5i254fMEjtBPu8P8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1828583,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roel van 't Hoff","original_name":"Roel van 't Hoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef978ae111d0b34e119a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291939,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jelle Dijkstra","original_name":"Jelle Dijkstra","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef96aad3665884ee11c2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jillis Schriel","original_name":"Jillis Schriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef989ab2b62cf159d6a29","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Brand","original_name":"Kim Brand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef946887b94bf5b657f94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Brand","original_name":"Kim Brand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef9558a025ba08ff3e0f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ralf Verbeek","original_name":"Ralf Verbeek","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665ef97fb5894b3ccff3e147","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/H5pmrMXhVE5i254fMEjtBPu8P8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield DocFest","release_date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
