They’re IPP prisoners – people who were given an additional indeterminate sentence, Imprisonment for Public Protection. Martin Read’s film looks at the punishment described by Conservative former Justice Minister Ken Clarke as ‘a stain on the Justice System’, following both the stories of individuals trapped in a Kafka-esque world of labyrinthine bureaucracy that has seen them swallowed up by a system, and those campaigning for their rights as human beings to have their lives returned to them.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/wXDOeUTOsFxgYQDMliKhbVBhwg8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain's Forgotten Prisoners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510541,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Hayling","original_name":"Alan Hayling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oRhoobU028XKpTXaTzbSnyvVOcm.jpg","credit_id":"665efc001d218aead1e11c59","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Davis","original_name":"Nick Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efc263a3b4fe5ea9d6205","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Sullivan","original_name":"Joe Sullivan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efc16e8f91b4cb26589eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3610641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Read","original_name":"Martin Read","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efbecae111d0b34e119b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Sullivan","original_name":"Joe Sullivan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efc0d9cf06cd751f3e135","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3610641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Read","original_name":"Martin Read","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665efbe292a7f699e580d778","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33049478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXDOeUTOsFxgYQDMliKhbVBhwg8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield DocFest","release_date":"2024-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Britain's Forgotten Prisoners - Sheffield DocFest 2024","key":"_xVy7Cpcq-4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-08T11:53:56.000Z","id":"66605560e9fba551ed511392"}]}}}
