They accompany different sequences of her personal life: on the Ile de Ré, where she spent long periods in the company of her husband, the writer Philippe Sollers; in Bulgaria, where she returns to the footsteps of her childhood. Mixed with these sequences, other older images, often intimate, present Kristeva in her youth. These private archives are the secret continent of a busy public and intellectual life.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":175953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julia Kristeva, étrange étrangère","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2562022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Kristeva","original_name":"Julia Kristeva","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/rSwIk4Zl4uKquwyj2KmThnVyVMG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64a099f7d5191f011cab7c91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Sollers","original_name":"Philippe Sollers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64a09a0dd5191f00ac924cc1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Caillat","original_name":"François Caillat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a09a2b8c0a4800c763fb43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141117,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anton Milanov","original_name":"Anton Milanov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a09a77d5191f00c5064494","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Trainee"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3825154,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Simeonov","original_name":"Alexander Simeonov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a09a870cb33500c4a5e665","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
