Shot on location at both Dollywood and Silver Dollar City in the fall and spring of 2016 and 2017, the film follows the stories as told by the brothers Jack and Pete Herschend; their wives, Sherry and JoDee; and the many others who were there in the early days of the company's inception. It's a celebration of the American spirit, Ozark ingenuity, love and humble beginnings...and serves as an inspiration even today.","popularity":0.2188,"poster_path":"/pqUshQc2HGTGVyASbbZU2ej9UFH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herschend
