Tom's troubles are compounded by a rival for his sweetheart's hand. In a drawn out fight he bests the rival, who steals the revenue from the firemen's ball (of which Tom is treasurer) and hides the money in the storage warehouse in which Tom's sister works as a stenographer. While Tom, Joe, and their sweethearts search for the money, the villain also returns for his loot, and, in his haste, he sets the building afire--trapping the foursome behind a steel door. Their calls for help reach the street, an alarm is turned in, firemen come to the rescue, and the money is found in a blazing desk.","popularity":0.2104,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Alarm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Lease","original_name":"Rex Lease","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/bzbAoS9GVC8s8hIum8Ccd58zYcm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"64a0b4fdd5191f011cab84c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Hawley","original_name":"Wanda Hawley","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/hDLCnGfPRTwp6egZxHn7EIRsdaB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom's Sweetheart","credit_id":"64a0b50981da3900ea7c55f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore von Eltz","original_name":"Theodore von Eltz","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/nq3mPGbn5iqyojutuUam8NXil5A.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"64a0b5124a52f80126949421","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1353648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Howell","original_name":"Hazel Howell","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Fire Chief's Daughter","credit_id":"64a0b523c390c5012d164078","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Captain of the Fire Brigade - Tom's Father","credit_id":"64a0b55681da39014d49d68a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Turner","original_name":"Florence Turner","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/h08KXju3kinUqw7RviRxB0ATLYG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Warehouse Proprietor's Wife","credit_id":"64a0b55e0cb3350138fcc3e8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Aubrey","original_name":"Jimmy Aubrey","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":"/u3v4qfimtESXD71mVAs6Jtk8pLS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64a0b563c390c5012d164089","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Apfel","original_name":"Oscar Apfel","popularity":0.291,"profile_path":"/1HxUEleoPk99JVDqzEDzaljMLih.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64a0b5694a52f8010715511d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Apfel","original_name":"Oscar Apfel","popularity":0.291,"profile_path":"/1HxUEleoPk99JVDqzEDzaljMLih.jpg","credit_id":"64a0b4dfd5191f00c5064d0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Natteford","original_name":"Jack Natteford","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0b4e78c0a480101768fc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3060663,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"W.
