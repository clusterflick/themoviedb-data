Billy Kidd appears on stage, singing and playing guitar wearing a vest and nothing else. This is a silent film but you can tell he can't play the guitar because his fingers never change on the frets.  Brian Idol is the next act, mounting the stage, removing his clothes and then putting his head band and boot on before performing in an even more half-hearted way on a guitar. He sways with the song and the camera lovingly lingers on his soft swaying cock.  Billy watches from behind a curtain, comes out, rests hick dick head on the table and puts something fizzy in Brian's drink. Brian sees the action but when he goes to drink it Billy knocks it out of his hand. Together they get on stage and perform a duet.  They end with a fist shake and a kiss.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4XpAAHmrKERuvbXD7T79jNq9S7H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kris Studios (Chicago)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Love Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":4140351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Idol","original_name":"Brian Idol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64a03f060cb3350138fc905d","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4140352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Kidd","original_name":"Billy Kidd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64a03f734a52f80107151f41","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4XpAAHmrKERuvbXD7T79jNq9S7H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":953,"name":"guitar"},{"id":208992,"name":"1960s"},{"id":238355,"name":"gay pornography"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":287603,"name":"cowboys"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Copyright on film is 1965 but it was not released until 1970.","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
