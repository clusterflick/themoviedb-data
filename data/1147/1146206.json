Even a fragmentary survival such as Oni azami is to be celebrated – the more so since the film marked the first of many appearances by popular star Chojiro Hayashi (1908-84) in Kinugasa films. The original story of Oni azami is credited to Fred Niblo, the American director of Blood and Sand (1922) and Ben-Hur (1925). It derives from The Red Lily (1924), a Ramón Novarro vehicle that had been a great success on its release in Japan.","popularity":0.2045,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demon Thistle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il cardo del demonio","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akiko Chihaya","original_name":"千早晶子","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/hFphTFF1ockjIadrlnN0bvDO8dz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Omitsu","credit_id":"649e826ec072a200cbd018a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuo Hasegawa","original_name":"長谷川一夫","popularity":0.4291,"profile_path":"/mt39pz3FtpDCb4vzNdMt3MSN4Tg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Reizaburo Namiki","credit_id":"649e8284c072a2012e244279","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teinosuke Kinugasa","original_name":"衣笠貞之助","popularity":0.2515,"profile_path":"/bwAT3bslRhVUNQXPKnnRpdnulRq.jpg","credit_id":"649e821c5aba3200c5dc8b25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taizō Fuyushima","original_name":"冬島泰三","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649e8242c072a200ece4cd9c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Niblo","original_name":"Fred Niblo","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/gtIMwkKyd4vQ7BmzojCl99HVXPs.jpg","credit_id":"649e82588289a000adea6b1b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
