Among the victims, one particular age group stands out for the sheer number of fatalities sustained: 12 and 13 year-olds, children of first year junior high school age. We investigate the tragedy of this lost generation, piecing together surviving records and speaking with survivors, for whom the memories of children robbed of their futures that day are still burned deep in their memories, nearly eight decades on.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/mctBUiB3xiTLc3MlE4xXdAFogC6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8000 Stolen Futures: The Children at the Center of the A-Bomb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2167054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Walzer","original_name":"Rachel Walzer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/gmXpUFiqzpyp6Aj8wUwP5YBCiya.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64a0e0588c0a4800c7642f97","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141510,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Goro Misumi","original_name":"Goro Misumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0e106d5191f011cabb1a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suguru Miyajima","original_name":"Suguru Miyajima","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0e0d4d5191f00ff8be2b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sawako Okoda","original_name":"Sawako Okoda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0e0e50cb33500e1957af3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141511,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hidefumi Matsuki","original_name":"Hidefumi Matsuki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0e12281da39010b8b3398","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uAkX5FDEbpwLceZtAyV05vRio4j.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sdUYYmiDCLbL1CYB8g642GnkmLR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1883,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mctBUiB3xiTLc3MlE4xXdAFogC6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1255}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":160381,"name":"nuclear weapons"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"NHK World","release_date":"2022-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
