But ever since her first appearance on television, she's kept a dark and upsetting side of her life in the spotlight private â€“ she is trolled online, daily, and with horrific ferocity. In this unflinchingly personal film, Rosie, who has cerebral palsy, sets out to try to understand how prevalent disability trolling is in the UK, and why it's often left completely unchecked. The film is a call to arms for all of us to play our part in ending the suffering of those who are abused simply because of their disability.","popularity":0.1007,"poster_path":"/xRJmMbT8R6Ag13RlrN2yAmzIYVV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61485,"logo_path":"/zmJQMYKn6VdC1YUxK76u54TImIP.png","name":"Twofour","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosie Jones: Am I A R*tard?","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Rosie Jones: Am I A Retard?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2477660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosie Jones","original_name":"Rosie Jones","popularity":0.189,"profile_path":"/vWcHJdghGtPdjWugO80Hi0nxj6O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"649f05a1d6590b00fec24c13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2215723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Fox","original_name":"Nikki Fox","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/cSt46yDcWuINOYdnP8f83hf1Kak.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b9aa883009aa00ffbf3501","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3043793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Levinge","original_name":"Tom Levinge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f05ac8d52c900eb4a6963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Brindley","original_name":"David Brindley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f05c28d52c900eb4a696b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grace Reynolds","original_name":"Grace Reynolds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f05b88d52c900ca199e25","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xRJmMbT8R6Ag13RlrN2yAmzIYVV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
