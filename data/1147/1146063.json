Haralds Mednis, acclaimed Latvian choral conductor, is expelled from participating at the National Song and Dance festival, and a symbolic Latvian song \"Gaismas pils\" (\"Castle of Light\") is excluded from the programme of the festival. However, the choirs and the public shout out Haralds Mednis's name and try to get him to conduct \"Gaismas pils\", in spite of the censors. This film is an attempt to imagine what the people working for the state apparatus tasked with oppressing any rebellious actuons might have felt at that moment back in 1985.","popularity":0.0876,"poster_path":"/sFJHfMMJ7JE3vBrQIPYQBqsdhYH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121953,"logo_path":null,"name":"LMT","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":144940,"logo_path":"/uXEBguYOOPQ2UjOzgR44jIaKAtb.png","name":"fon Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaismas pils","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toms Treibergs","original_name":"Toms Treibergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"649df4398289a0011cc164f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1921855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ieva Puķe","original_name":"Ieva Puķe","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/iMHwoHr037kgmhfqTVWkIB6f9xP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"649df446091e6200eb7b36f4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4137721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marģers Majors","original_name":"Marģers Majors","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"649df4503e6f2b00c536e0d7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4138727,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maksis Gauja","original_name":"Maksis Gauja","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649eed3e3e6f2b00e2de1a31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3262338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgars Kaupers","original_name":"Edgars Kaupers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649eed305aba3200ffdb8d33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397765,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dāvids Smiltiņš","original_name":"Dāvids Smiltiņš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649eed4b5aba3200ffdb8d44","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971476,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ance Beinaroviča","original_name":"Ance Beinaroviča","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a02861c390c500caff8ccf","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3991869,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Līva Drešere","original_name":"Līva Drešere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a028858c0a4800c763cae2","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699652,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernests Ansons","original_name":"Ernests Ansons","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a02af1d5191f00ff8b8464","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3262191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edvards Mikāls","original_name":"Edvards Mikāls","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a028b34a52f800c994477f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712635,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Kaupere","original_name":"Eva Kaupere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a02819c390c500aeb0a085","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3262158,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Aksels Millers","original_name":"Aksels Millers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0283b0cb3350138fc84b0","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3262338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgars Kaupers","original_name":"Edgars Kaupers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649df3853e6f2b00ffb46db3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFJHfMMJ7JE3vBrQIPYQBqsdhYH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Forum Cinemas","release_date":"2023-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
