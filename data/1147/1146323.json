He has had limited opportunity to climb the prestigious career ladder as he would like. Yet finally, Curtis is hugely proud of his new authoritative role as TV Licence Inspector. This is a chance to impress and win back his ex-girlfriend and finally get the respect he has been denied throughout his existence.
