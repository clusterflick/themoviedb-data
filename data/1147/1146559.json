A saddened Grant is drawn into an affair with town siren Margaret Muller, with whom he has an illegitimate son. On the rebound, Laura marries VanDorn and Margaret weds attorney Henry Fenn. History repeats itself when Laura's husband becomes infatuated with Margaret, which breaks up both marriages. Meanwhile, Grant has given up his newspaper to become a foreman in the mines. After he is injured in an explosion, Grant is taken to the Nesbit home, where Laura's care restores his health. When Grant's little son is shot and killed during a strike, he becomes so overwrought with grief that he confesses the boy's parentage to Laura, who forgives his past and they begin a new life together.","popularity":0.1941,"poster_path":"/tjkOkLCHDnt3jfL6hjiBt7HDA8x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mayflower Photoplay Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Heart of a Fool","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kirkwood","original_name":"James Kirkwood","popularity":0.279,"profile_path":"/svL7O0IG1wHWXr9BUIolCWkKeeN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grant Adams","credit_id":"649fb27a0cb33500fe5e3718","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Q.
