The answer became clear when UNC-TV approached the group in 2012 with its offer to help the Raleigh Ringers produce a sequel to the ensemble's critically-acclaimed \"One Winter Evening at Meymandi.\" The PBS special, \"Holiday Handbells,\" was produced from this DVD and now airs nationally each year.  Digitally recorded in the acoustically superior Meymandi Concert Hall in Raleigh, NC, and produced by the talented UNC-TV professionals in 5.1 channel surround sound using six HD cameras, \"A December Tradition\" is bound to become another fan favorite, regionally and nationwide.","popularity":0.0869,"poster_path":"/iR27jjBMjPQzNBUi4iDVUmZDlBE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113629,"logo_path":"/bNTjDkN9pTSLEGeod6NVSImjkz5.png","name":"UNC-TV","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A December Tradition","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Raleigh Ringers","original_name":"The Raleigh Ringers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Performers","credit_id":"64a11a9ad5191f00e2642824","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141784,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David M.
