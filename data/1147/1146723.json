The main protagonist tries to show to a couple of observers the variety of interpersonal relationships. Their attitude, to start with – mocking, gradually becomes reflective. The title of the work alludes to Ian Dury’s cult song Sex&Drugs & Rock&Roll. The artist draws attention to the different possible meanings of the word ‘drugs’– a means of intoxication but also a curative treatment.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/59mrv9hlwlrPGJcs9rFZXP3u6BN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex, Medicated, Rock’n’Roll","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoliy Belov","original_name":"Anatoliy Belov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64a0518581da39012c6ef228","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoliy Belov","original_name":"Anatoliy Belov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a04dff8c0a4800ae23ef89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoliy Belov","original_name":"Anatoliy Belov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a051a58c0a48011e1c54b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oksana Kazmina","original_name":"Oksana Kazmina","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a051d48c0a4801017668b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2041384,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oleksandr Roshchyn","original_name":"Олександр Рощин","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/kCpwkQfMI3GtnsJSVtiVSHttX1n.jpg","credit_id":"64a0528f81da39014d49b05a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2049,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/59mrv9hlwlrPGJcs9rFZXP3u6BN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kasseler Dokfest","release_date":"2014-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"(Kyiv) (Pinchuk Art Centre)","release_date":"2013-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
