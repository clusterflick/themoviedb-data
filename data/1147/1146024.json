Human!! (突撃！ヒューマン！！ Totsugeki! Hyūman!!) is a Japanese tokusatsu series co-produced by Nippon TV and Union Motion Picture Co. in association with Mot Boule. Filmed as a live stage show, it was broadcast on television from October 7, 1972 to December 30, 1972. Having never been released on home video and the master tapes believed to have been overwritten, the show is now considered completely lost. Many of the suits used for the kaiju were acquired by Toho through Bin Promotion, using them for their 1973 series Go!
