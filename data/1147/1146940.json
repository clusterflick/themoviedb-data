This breath-taking blue-chip natural history film is a journey through Okavango’s seasons, seen through the eyes of an indigenous River Bushman. Our storyteller guides us through the course of Okavango’s flood and into a savage drought, interweaving intimate and spectacular wildlife stories. The arrival and disappearance of precious water determines the destiny of the millions of animals that call Okavango home. For many, the flood is a lifeline. For others, it brings the greatest challenges. Everyone lives or dies by this epic event. It is the heartbeat of the Kalahari.","popularity":1.5714,"poster_path":"/2xKp9gEeTRIsTzMuySYbpRLIXVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99272,"logo_path":"/xt9cawh63M0bkKrc0VvDtZ8q2sa.png","name":"Icon
