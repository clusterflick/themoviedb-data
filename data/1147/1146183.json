She had been arrested by Iran’s religious police, accused of not wearing her hijab properly. The authorities said she had died of a heart attack, but rumors spread that she had been beaten on arrest. Citizens took to the streets in their thousands in fury.  This is an extraordinary and shocking insight into what has been happening across Iran, revealing a regime under huge pressure and resorting to extreme cruelty to control its citizens.","popularity":0.5053,"poster_path":"/rsiemHiupgyNLSPtZpPyU0t86T3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11594,"logo_path":"/4w31g1L8zrpOuZ7s7f83qkmfOVZ.png","name":"Passion
