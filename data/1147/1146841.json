She's bored and lonely, so a friend, wealthy widow and woman of the world Ora Blake, easily gets her to share a trip to Europe. There, Ida lives the high life amid the continent's rich and carefree, but soon grows weary of it, wishing she were home again with her true love. Back in Butte, Gregory has hit a gold strike and telegraphs Ida of his luck. Ora however, with a secret love for Gregory, sabotages Ida's response by rewriting the return cable to indicate Ida will return, but only for a share in the gold. When the travelers return to Montana, Ida has found out about what backstabbing Ora has done, and fight it out at the mine, but unaware of their presence, the now-disillusioned Gregory intends on blowing up the mine at the same time.","popularity":0.272,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perch of the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Busch","original_name":"Mae Busch","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/1GZrCqpo91Oq1cfJpJ2zbxDHSun.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ida Hook","credit_id":"64a0a76881da3900ad2bb20f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat O'Malley","original_name":"Pat O'Malley","popularity":0.1365,"profile_path":"/4evplBNQp1k390ec2Ivrvp4jSF8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gregory Compton","credit_id":"64a0a7af0cb335011bcb9854","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Winton","original_name":"Jane Winton","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/5ZjnRtGI5gfcxWpIPRIqUTDhcBm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ora Blake","credit_id":"64a0a7b781da39014d49d273","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore von Eltz","original_name":"Theodore von Eltz","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/nq3mPGbn5iqyojutuUam8NXil5A.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lord Mobray","credit_id":"64a0a7c081da39010b8b04e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Carillo","original_name":"Mario Carillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/tyxGEyyLcZZjP4h0Dio6v2DZaGY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Marchese Valdonia","credit_id":"64a0a7d38c0a4800ae241397","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lincoln Stedman","original_name":"Lincoln Stedman","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/jj5tbRuTw0RuEezTazYNoILGlHN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Freddy Dipper","credit_id":"64a0a7e68c0a48011e1c7a56","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Kuwa","original_name":"George Kuwa","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/3FLRNdB4219ZfrZyS3qND4z6SLz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Charley Lee","credit_id":"64a0a7f181da3900ad2bb240","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Oakman","original_name":"Gertrude Oakman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Ruby Miller","credit_id":"64a0a88a4a52f800c9947eff","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Franklin","original_name":"Martha Franklin","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Stout","credit_id":"64a0a89ac390c500caffc1b6","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":921738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Baggot","original_name":"King Baggot","popularity":0.4096,"profile_path":"/3RH89Z7zLKJjVRyb0vz27fWn9d3.jpg","credit_id":"64a0a7340cb335011bcb9822","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1079355,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary O'Hara","original_name":"Mary O'Hara","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":"/rm7GzySz5wgXTVBLjQlgaKhPU1f.jpg","credit_id":"64a0a7464a52f800af122105","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gertrude Atherton","original_name":"Gertrude Atherton","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0a74fd5191f00ac925189","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78833,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles J.
