There, he became fascinated by Iranian culture, and began to study the country’s history in earnest, specialising in the pre-Islamic Sasanian era. In 1964, Edward Keall explored the ruins of the so-called Yazdegerd’s Castle, which local legends attributed to the last of the Sasanian king of kings. After he had secured a job in 1972 as a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum (Canada), Keall’s proposal to re-activate his old exploration of the castle of King Yazdegerd was endorsed by the Iranian archaeological authorities. The first Canadian expedition was mounted in 1965; the last one was terminated abruptly in February 1979 when the Shah of Iran was toppled by the supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini. The film documents the events of these times.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/2eL1tO08VbwGuchcS47ctA031aY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130318,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Wave Production","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey to Yazdegerd Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"سفر به قلعه یزدگرد","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Journey to the Yazdgerd Castle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Edward Keall","original_name":"Dr. Edward Keall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0a3f34a52f800e82d9b0f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510043,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ramin Doostan","original_name":"Ramin Doostan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0a85c0cb33500e1954915","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ario Khoshbin","original_name":"Ario Khoshbin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0aa154a52f80145de51d5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aref Mohammadi","original_name":"Aref Mohammadi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0a9bcc390c5010c62712a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2623226,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Asif Limbada","original_name":"Asif Limbada","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/AwEjfvCght46QXF06K04ycxWeX2.jpg","credit_id":"64a0a83381da3900c9ecedf3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aref Mohammadi","original_name":"Aref Mohammadi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0a9d481da39012c6f1513","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aref Mohammadi","original_name":"Aref Mohammadi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0aa694a52f80107154dfa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Artadner Farhadi","original_name":"Artadner Farhadi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0aa3e4a52f80145de51f2","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26919755","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o5FTAQ48WakO3ACpOyycotepALp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2eL1tO08VbwGuchcS47ctA031aY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Journey to Yazdegerd Castle سفر به قلعه یزدگرد","key":"SOIxrf76Dzk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-06T23:07:42.000Z","id":"64a0a160d5191f00ac924f75"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Journey to Yazdegerd Castle official trailer سفر به قلعه یزدگرد","key":"iJNY4Uk_h2s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-30T04:27:54.000Z","id":"64a0a2298c0a4800c763fdbf"}]}}}
