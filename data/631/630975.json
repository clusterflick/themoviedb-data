In this session, the three films are about three major figures in the English universe: filmmaker Peter Whitehead, novelist and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer, and writer J. G. Ballard. In these cinematographic portraits, Petit explores the potentialities of the hybridization between fiction and documentary, building elaborate stories - supported in genres such as the police story - to better define the characters. In the biography of Ballard, we have a curious participation of David Cronenberg about to embark on the adaptation of Crash.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rudy Wurlitzer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Petit","original_name":"Chris Petit","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/jWIZPCUCjPWDlfQVkv4F0NLKO0G.jpg","credit_id":"5d7bc275af43246735972ac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0221525","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"UK Television Premiere","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Porto/Post/Doc - [5ยบ] Film & Media Festival","release_date":"2018-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
