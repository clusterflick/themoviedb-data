The magical dreams of his youth appear from time to time, but daily routine quickly takes over. His striving for material wealth – including a Trabant car, a shelving unit, a boat – leads him to betray his youthful ideals, and he ultimately becomes a slave to his possessions. In the final frames of the film, “LIVE” – written in large white letters – ironically reminds viewers not to forget to follow their dreams.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/k0oeymjrZewoTPKqn3aBPvMWrpy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55763,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEFA-Studio für Trickfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"6076f33c19ab5900297d1128","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5d7a78f00d5d850013dde2e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723821,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helmut Krahnert","original_name":"Helmut Krahnert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e41c7e4c52746665dce693","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1784925,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eva d'Bomba","original_name":"Eva d'Bomba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e41c8fd70c615903760e64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":104675,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernd Wefelmeyer","original_name":"Bernd Wefelmeyer","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e41c9fd70c615903760e69","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3083854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k0oeymjrZewoTPKqn3aBPvMWrpy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
