Diana, a child welfare doctor, has yet to come to terms with the changes that this will entail. Emma has an unthinking husband and Diana, a demanding neighbour, both of whom find themselves at Diana's while she's out. Add to this a Black woman who has travelled across town with her two children and a dog and you can imagine the confusion that results. Based on interviews with over 30 women about their experiences of motherhood, this sit-com manages to capture all the traumas and confessions which can face various women during one day.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domestic Bliss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Chamberlain","original_name":"Joy Chamberlain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d777bb15907de00112c6b7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
