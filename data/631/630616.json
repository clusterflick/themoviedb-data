New to the city, to its busy and quick rhythm, Adam tries to keep pace and enthusiasm but, among thousands and thousands of other strangers, he is subconsciously afraid to disappear: “When nobody’s watching, do I exist?”.

Asking for help, Adam seems to be ignored by all the odd people he encounters until he realises that he is not being ignored but unseen.","popularity":0.2287,"poster_path":"/2ShSRt8LuAc4EE7qcMh6rHs0j2o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nihil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Nihil-1091896694314866","instagram_id":"nihilshortfilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ru5cVQg3MxcCnEQNzim6uswhGgJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1968,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2ShSRt8LuAc4EE7qcMh6rHs0j2o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12565,"name":"psychological thriller"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vimeo (Christian Hochstrasser)","release_date":"2019-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
