They filmed extensively in the region around Deventer, but the film also includes footage of Arnhem, Scheveningen, Walcheren and the Wieringermeer polder. The couple had an eye for the small ways in which everyday life continued in the liberated Netherlands.","popularity":0.1697,"poster_path":"/s5MdEKJZ5qzODpxiS41hA6xF549.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Regain by Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Roosdorp","original_name":"Alex Roosdorp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7ba0e433ec260012801ec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s5MdEKJZ5qzODpxiS41hA6xF549.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160224,"name":"post world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
