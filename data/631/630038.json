Freddie has a big heart, and when he discovers a dog being abused by its owner, he decides to take action. Against his father's wish, Freddie kidnaps the dog in terribly stormy weather and hides it in his room. The dog, Storm, has a very unusual ability, he can run very fast. Freddie takes Storm to the racetrack and the dog trainer, Sofie, offers to help tutor him.  Even though things are progressing, and the dog race championship is around the corner, there's still opposition: especially from a father who can't know anything and a very intimidating dog owner, who suddenly appears out of the blue. Thankfully, Freddie has some good people by his side, including the warm-hearted Mrs. Andersen and a very nice girl from the school.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"bullying, race, children movie, Denmark, child protagonist, dog movie, drama, family, dog race","title":"Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
