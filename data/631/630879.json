I hoped that the title might bring to mind the American Elm tree, which was seen to be doomed by way of disease.  The assassination of Kennedy in 1963 was a tremendously emotional blow and omen of things to come. The whole country watched the funeral ceremonies play out on TV, and I taped everything I could of those events – music,  words, prayers, the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald , and more. I needed to make a film that would incorporate some of those sounds, but I also wanted to introduce other components. Some people assumed I was making an homage to JFK. That is not the case. I think it should be clear that what I was concerned about was the evolving state of our nation.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/e3UvtfZEhrdKpQCae5y0du6vqb1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5d7b61c433ec2600117fc1c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10986236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e3UvtfZEhrdKpQCae5y0du6vqb1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Elms (1964)","key":"248408001","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-12-22T01:54:52.000Z","id":"5e4977a12d93750013a89322"}]}}}
