I believe the footage was completed before the assassination of Kennedy – an event that changed many things. I had made only silent films until I made THE ELMS, which followed upon this one. SSP is a film whose form I had in mind from the outset. It was to be a visual piece structured in a 'musical' manner. It would have three movements in differing visual 'tempi'. Rhythms, counterpoint, theme and variation, and so on were to be in mind as I filmed and edited. The thematic material would develop slowly, and there would be recapitulations and so on. The three sections are entitled 'Barn', 'Summer Storm', and 'Bird'.  A sense of place, shelter, and fertility. A welcoming of the necessary summer storm of birthing. A child’s wonder and excitement at experiencing the vast unfolding world.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/oxU2yZhagMjJLrB3Gp6X2Op1GiJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Storm Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5d7b622c069f0e066f327e44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10986238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxU2yZhagMjJLrB3Gp6X2Op1GiJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Film-Makers' Cinematheque","release_date":"1965-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Summer Storm Passage","key":"349798770","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-24T03:07:27.000Z","id":"5e4976af35811d0019486171"}]}}}
