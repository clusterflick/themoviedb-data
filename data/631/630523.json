It was made with students from one of my seminars. We attempt to deconstruct a poem’s language by playing it backwards until some words emerge from the backward text. The students then created film images that illustrate this new text. Then they create new sounds that relate to those images. It was a way to turn language into a means to generate a film free from the restrictions of its most immediate intention.\" — Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0472,"poster_path":"/49FxnuzjBY4LU49VxJsXzByhbmm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"Sorry/Hear Us\"","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","credit_id":"5d7964bfaf432406ca970f4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49FxnuzjBY4LU49VxJsXzByhbmm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3EoNFycQnR5I9RF5texHnLvbzFf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":648}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
