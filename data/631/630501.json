The Brexit news gave completely different kind of concussion to the commonly established center of Europe.","popularity":0.2321,"poster_path":"/rAOeUeawIgDRZRIt6pOQcxoPYe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brussels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gints Grūbe","original_name":"Gints Grūbe","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/6GGLvVF0lsMjs8RsW6PR9S16eaR.jpg","credit_id":"5d794953e263bb001005ea68","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7949105b9508604113b7c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1509890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inese Kļava","original_name":"Inese Kļava","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pQC5RSe2sVXgKSfITWc0dbMwI1F.jpg","credit_id":"5d794924e8601700131d4000","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1509890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inese Kļava","original_name":"Inese Kļava","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pQC5RSe2sVXgKSfITWc0dbMwI1F.jpg","credit_id":"5d7948d5069f0e5e4d314977","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604659,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kārlis Auzāns","original_name":"Kārlis Auzāns","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/fMlOa8ag3OTan5azmwxrHXhBQqT.jpg","credit_id":"5d794901e8601700101d3f16","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","original_name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d79493c5b95082faf13b42d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2189237,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Inese Boka-Grūbe","original_name":"Inese Boka-Grūbe","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/74KtaqppZgcpiLVnpRER3FryD94.jpg","credit_id":"5fe2d2dcf14dad003ccbf265","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906064,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ieva Alberte","original_name":"Ieva Alberte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2d2a5b2e0740040732bcf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Agnese Krivade","original_name":"Agnese Krivade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2d2b9f14dad003dcbcc72","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2271604,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mārtiņš Jurēvics","original_name":"Mārtiņš Jurēvics","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2d307e640d60040a6fc6c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408870,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dāvis Doršs","original_name":"Dāvis Doršs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2d2f3b2e0740040732c72","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rAOeUeawIgDRZRIt6pOQcxoPYe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1295,"name":"europe"},{"id":222444,"name":"brussel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dokumentālās filmas BRISELE treileris","key":"333327868","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-30T12:56:56.000Z","id":"5ff86c39efea7a003f6d0f13"}]}}}
