He lives in Sofia with his wife Ghinka in a three room suburban apartment. As a socialist he feels confused by the ‘crazy’ democracy and the uncertainties of the transition period. The couple’s combined pensions amount to $66.00. Ephtim experiences constant difficulties in balancing the family budget. Free medical care and lunches at a subsidised canteen are essential to his survival strategy. This portrait of a Bulgarian pensioner is presented in the context of a global hopelessness and a clearly felt nostalgia for the communist past.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Month In The Life of Ephtim D.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonii Dontchev","original_name":"Antonii Dontchev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d771554069f0e000e318700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
