The film unfolds in waves. Locations appear, disappear, and come round again – Lewinsky Park, Maximilian Park, Habima Square, Lion Square, Zuccotti Park, Times Square or pastoral landscapes at opposite ends of the Mediterranean Sea. The actions are the same: people wait, pass by, kill time. No refugees in the picture here, no demonstrators or soldiers, no spectacle. It is a film running alongside events, alongside time. A contemporary film in the pure sense of the word - a way of being with time.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1393084,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Herman Asselberghs","original_name":"Herman Asselberghs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7a31750d5d850010dd9e62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10944856","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
