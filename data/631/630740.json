It’s the first example of Dammbeck’s experimental, grotesque, surrealistic style of animation. The idea of flying, which Dammbeck uses here for the first time, will reappear continuously in his next films. THE TAILOR OF ULM established Dammbeck’s reputation among East German animation directors.","popularity":0.0995,"poster_path":"/vkWWg1mz2vLGDlqZUJqEv0Yp2Dv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tailor of Ulm","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Lang","original_name":"Alexander Lang","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67e41de17b7313b5aef0b560","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5d7a7a60af43243b21973795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"67e41df3ec98bf0a0d761ad2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erich Günther","original_name":"Erich Günther","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e41e007db9e70c47dcad29","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2608197,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hannelore Greifenberg","original_name":"Hannelore Greifenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e41e0fd70c615903760f5c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Hertel","original_name":"Thomas Hertel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e41e23d70c615903760f7e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1452516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vkWWg1mz2vLGDlqZUJqEv0Yp2Dv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
