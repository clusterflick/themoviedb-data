Critical of all manifestations of fascism, the film's visuals and sound set up a tension between two libidinal economies - that of fascism (the super father) where the father is everything, and the world of the masochist, where the mother is everything and the father is nothing.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Father is Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leone Knight","original_name":"Leone Knight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d777d165907de000f2c69cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
