His journey takes him across Scotland, where he meets believers using social media to spread the message of 'waking up to the lies' and those who are taking to the streets with banners and flyers speaking to the public face to face.  Finding a small but growing community of Scots leads him to Colorado, USA, and to the second International Flat Earth Conference, where he gets an insight into the movement on an entirely new level.
