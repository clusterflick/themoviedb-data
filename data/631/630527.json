She is travelling in the cube-shaped space ship. On her way she meets abnormal phenomena. The further she goes, the more the reality mixes up with dream-like sequences. At the end of the journey, she arrives at a place with a mirror-like object. The astronaut leaves her space ship and goes through to another side of the mirror. That causes the creation of a doppelganger and causes even more deconstruction to reality. The astronaut’s helmet is taken off and then she is sitting at a table at a bar on (probably) Earth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2L4GTqpIv3YjJBECqCX5GFKFcdD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odds and Evens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michał Czyż","original_name":"Michał Czyż","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d796955e8601700121d5adc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2L4GTqpIv3YjJBECqCX5GFKFcdD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Ravenheart International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
