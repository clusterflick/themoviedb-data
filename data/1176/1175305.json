While coming to terms with his dad’s death, Kristin discovered the original script for Groovopolis, which follows a music programmer who falls overboard at a work party, encounters a group of wild, dancing island inhabitants, and inadvertently records their music before being rescued and spreading the sounds as an antidote to dull and monotonous consumer culture. Produced scenes from Groovopolis eerily show up in and influence Kristin’s own life, and the unusual collaboration yields an excavation of family, legacy, and navigating adulthood.","popularity":0.2403,"poster_path":"/zIGef2VIrUkTxJaqlhtvWh5RmfX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pallet Projects","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is happiness just a temporary delusion?","title":"Finding Groovopolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.J.
