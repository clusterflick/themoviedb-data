With non-linear storytelling and fragmented images, the work moves between speculative fiction, documentary, and experimental film. Referencing Theresa Hak Kyung Cha’s Dictee (1982) and Anne Carson’s poem On Walking Backwards (1995), it considers the space and metaphor of a void and the desire that moves between the dead and living.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dxzAniPFTS2mveExePFaT4GNSjA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Line Connects the Void","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tram Nghiem","original_name":"Tram Nghiem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc0173ffc9de0ee2073262","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4ZBJA06xeaKDVu40ZpT1kitsCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oEWZYvRAevqG5De8UfHkCR90U9O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wGKJguolZ3H8s86U99kajhTuFF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9eJdvhjZNakQfojadWe5BpLSD5X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rYjKpwvVechnnjHY5Y36BPgZjdm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2jpe1lpsmbFPb3B2wFPr0B8n6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dxzAniPFTS2mveExePFaT4GNSjA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g1MHMM4XQKmqcnNhKJlUzF8ta73.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
