This work used the Broadway musical model to adapt the famous Chinese myth Legend of the White Snake. Bringing together Eastern and Western theatrical styles, the production combined Chinese traditional music, dance, costume and stage design with modern Western concepts. Despite this bold attempt, the resulting work was ahead of its time and was not a commercial success. This year in April, however, a partial film record of the performance was miraculously discovered. The restored surviving footage has become the finale of this documentary, Pai Niang Niang: The Last Osmanthus Blossom, bringing the saga to a flawless conclusion.","popularity":0.0731,"poster_path":"/bl0H7RP124BcoN0SmpKrLtBCbA5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pai Niang Niang:  The Last Osmanthus Blossom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Pan","original_name":"Rebecca Pan","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/fbFl1uGb5Uo2FPA5S5jvgGevHYE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64fa790543494f0100cdc9fd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4259825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Wong","original_name":"Isabel Wong","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fa7926dc1cb400b0ba6f65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2970,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bl0H7RP124BcoN0SmpKrLtBCbA5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1980}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pai Niang Niang Documentary (Hong Kong) Official Trailer","key":"929201280","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-31T02:49:12.000Z","id":"661486f4ac617c0164b112e3"}]}}}
