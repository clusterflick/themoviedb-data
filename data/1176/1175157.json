Their return has had profound consequences for Afghanistan, and their implementation of harsh Islamist rule has upended life for many Afghans. A key aspect of Taliban governance is the implementation of Sharia Law, fulfilling one of the key promises of Taliban rule- the promise of equal justice under Quranic principle.  'Swift Justice' is an observational look at one such court room in Musa Qala, Helmand province, a heartland of Taliban resistance. Here we see rural Afghans play out their roles as plaintiffs and defendants, searching for justice in this complicated and delicate time of peace and increasing authoritarian rule.","popularity":0.1302,"poster_path":"/6i34u28B0zscmRtuoMBWHh9Of8O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swift Justice","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1771319,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ross McDonnell","original_name":"Ross McDonnell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/5JvhIpisSnw1a0QTDrBTx2jx6g9.jpg","credit_id":"64f9d5f4a8b2ca4f1bc91362","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4258693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor J.
