This local history speaks to systemic racial injustice towards Vancouver’s Black community that has continued to this day. Revelatory conversations are had in the film surrounding the erasure of Black history in Canada, and the proliferation of hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan which had chapters in Vancouver. Histories of now-closed Black-owned businesses in Hogan’s Alley such as Vie’s Chicken and Steakhouse have inspired a new generation of Black business owners in the neighbourhood, and the Black Lives Matter movement has reinvigorated discussion surrounding the destruction, as well as the history and memory of Hogan’s Alley. Beautifully filmed, this visual portrait speaks to the legacies of the past, as well as the present moment.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/qDp0CMA4tXdAVQFhAG1d5N7SxNQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Union Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4259878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamila Pomeroy","original_name":"Jamila Pomeroy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fa9265e0ca7f010de7b2de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26737109","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qDp0CMA4tXdAVQFhAG1d5N7SxNQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
