Arjun Bawa and Kayden Sadhra-Kang skate in the footsteps of their father Robin Bawa, who made history in 1989 as the first South Asian to play in the NHL. Meanwhile, seasoned defenseman Arvin Atwal seeks to shed the fighter reputation he acquired in the American Hockey League by transferring to Slovakia. And, in an uplifting turn of events, the film traces the journey of Surrey’s own Arshdeep Bains to signing with the Vancouver Canucks.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mareya Shot, Keetah Goal: Make the Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nilesh Patel","original_name":"Nilesh Patel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fa9950dc1cb400b0ba81ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baljit Sangra","original_name":"Baljit Sangra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fa993a43494f08c5f2a940","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Anandi Brownstein","original_name":"Eva Anandi Brownstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a8bab32c6b7b0139a1e0d3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844940,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jessica Dymond","original_name":"Jessica Dymond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a8ba9b8eda87012b85c28d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baljit Sangra","original_name":"Baljit Sangra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a8baf1fc5f06012ebac67e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
