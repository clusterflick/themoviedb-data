Deeply respected by fellow luminaries in folk, blues and jazz, Dane built a far-reaching legacy with music, activism, and love. As Maureen Gosling’s celebratory portrait reveals, early solidarity with those suffering racial and economic injustice sparked Dane’s passion to use her talent to sustain marginalized people. Rather than chase stardom, she followed her own maternal instincts to root herself and her family among generations of activist performers. Bonnie Raitt, Jane Fonda and other notables attest to Dane’s unique way of shaping and being shaped by tumultuous social revolutions from the 1950s on. Nearing 90, Dane triumphantly tours with piano virtuoso Tammy Hall to celebrate a life of staying awake and connected, true to her ideals. One star among many illuminates so much.","popularity":1.1022,"poster_path":"/tp6LetQPYzvlkFI4eApFrAV1VvM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Protesta Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 9 Lives of Barbara Dane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Dane","original_name":"Barbara Dane","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64facd6cdb4ed6104306b7d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Raitt","original_name":"Bonnie Raitt","popularity":0.3848,"profile_path":"/lN2PD7LGsltMmZj03DpaVrd7gYJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64face4ee0ca7f00cbe859f4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Fonda","original_name":"Jane Fonda","popularity":1.4049,"profile_path":"/5Yb3nmRWXXZAxNhfhEuOMdfyVNN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64face57dc1cb400c8bf2520","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4260114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Chambers","original_name":"Willie Chambers","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64face87a35c8e011cf4f228","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4260116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Menendez","original_name":"Nina Menendez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64faceba43494f08c47f1e53","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Gosling","original_name":"Maureen Gosling","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/mGgojlTTDbeRluc63rCQQDp8Ztc.jpg","credit_id":"64facda9af58cb00c4856f1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Gosling","original_name":"Maureen Gosling","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/mGgojlTTDbeRluc63rCQQDp8Ztc.jpg","credit_id":"64facd7fe0ca7f010de7cae7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Glover","original_name":"Danny Glover","popularity":1.4787,"profile_path":"/yjow3MJDkgQuHx1fCpo4FZmXZcq.jpg","credit_id":"64face9daf58cb00ac23b982","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jed Riffe","original_name":"Jed Riffe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64facd91af58cb00fe5f54f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Gosling","original_name":"Maureen Gosling","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/mGgojlTTDbeRluc63rCQQDp8Ztc.jpg","credit_id":"65e15d5041a5610186834495","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32394267","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tp6LetQPYzvlkFI4eApFrAV1VvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":213899,"name":"bay area"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mill Valley Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
