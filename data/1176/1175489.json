A shootout ensued, killing Jackson, two other inmates and three guards, and wounding three more officers. Authorities asserted that only lawyer Stephen Bingham could have smuggled the weapon into the prison. Fearing that a conviction for abetting the guards’ deaths would lead to his own murder, the attorney fled, beginning a long, strange odyssey of pseudonymous exile. Strange indeed for the Yale-graduate scion of politically prominent New England elites.","popularity":0.3919,"poster_path":"/jOHMbX3czDLcuohpMCuPHTg10iL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Double Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752851,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gaëtane Rousseau","original_name":"Gaëtane Rousseau","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fadf26af58cb0a5f4b98a5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Masud","original_name":"Catherine Masud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aycYl4zyNQRllrphkRQA3yW4k9A.jpg","credit_id":"64fade6fdb4ed610343d5bc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1477623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abby Ginzberg","original_name":"Abby Ginzberg","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fade80db4ed61032a4dc75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40151,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louise Rubacky","original_name":"Louise Rubacky","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fadf35ffc9de00ac509003","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16152130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2898,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jOHMbX3czDLcuohpMCuPHTg10iL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1962}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":180079,"name":"san quentin"},{"id":213899,"name":"bay area"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mill Valley Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MVFF46 - A DOUBLE LIFE - Official Trailer","key":"Jd4DxGoTfpc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-21T23:48:47.000Z","id":"64fade55e0ca7f014f6e32f9"}]}}}
