What is this truth and where is it to be found? Is there only one? What do these so different people have in common? What strange time was that second half of the twentieth century?  These are the questions that may come to mind when watching the confrontation between two Czech Chileans, Milan Platovsky and Hanns Stein. The fate of the former could be written in the Guinness Book of Records - he is a twice-nationalised capitalist. The latter, on the other hand, has always been where the violence has come - in 1939 (Hitler), 1968 (Brezhnev) and 1973 (Pinochet) - on the other side, of course. You can meet both of them in the documentary film by Pavel Koutecký and Jan Burian, made in January 1999.","popularity":0.1254,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":76609,"logo_path":"/lAhg89P2RmPjCJYxkuqT6YMvMlY.png","name":"Film & Sociologie","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kde je pravda?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Koutecký","original_name":"Pavel Koutecký","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fa2631e0ca7f00ec8a7806","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629766,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Petras","original_name":"Jan Petras","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1186515c6360150aa76a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727578,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jan Burian","original_name":"Jan Burian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1183e2790bf0151561c46","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727578,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jan Burian","original_name":"Jan Burian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b11845b76cbb01942bbabb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2283433,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hana Jemelíková","original_name":"Hana Jemelíková","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1185dbe6d88019243f520","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629767,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michal Houdek","original_name":"Michal Houdek","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b11871a3144001385a8158","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727578,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jan Burian","original_name":"Jan Burian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b118beea37e00193e48012","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2499426,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jiří Hejlek","original_name":"Jiří Hejlek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b11879ea37e00172e46650","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4497531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"František Seidl","original_name":"František Seidl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b118d3be6d8801364389e9","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Krása","original_name":"Jan Krása","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b118aeb9a0bd0193451523","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Koutecký","original_name":"Pavel Koutecký","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1184cb9a0bd017244f61e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Koutecký","original_name":"Pavel Koutecký","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b118542fe2fa01373ca339","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q104894662","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"2000-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
