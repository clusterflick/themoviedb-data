His entire mission is put at risk when he kills a rival for her love, a French journalist and blackmailer. (This film was later modified and released in 1934 as Police File 909. That new 76 minute version dramatically altered its plot from the original and the Japanese are now portrayed as unsympathetic villains. The new version was approved by German censors and released in 1934 although its critical reception was poor. It is possible that Wiene, who had left for Budapest in 1933 following the Nazi rise to power, did not personally work on the new version).
