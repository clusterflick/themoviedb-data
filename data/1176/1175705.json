After a third strike with police, Jason is headed to prison until his mother concocts a plan for him to serve out his year-long probation on a ranch in the middle of nowhere with his estranged grandfather, Griff Bowden, whom he thought was dead. Griff has lived a self-imposed life of solitude since the death of his wife twenty years ago, and he has no interest in getting to know anyone, much less his delinquent good-for-nothing grandson. Problem after problem unfolds as these two men, trapped in a house together discover dark secrets from their pasts. But everything comes to a crashing halt, when Jason’s enemies discover where he’s hiding and come to collect a long overdue debt. It’s action and intrigue with a lesson on the importance of accepting grace from God and passing it on to others.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for the Elephant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
