Set in a small village on the India/Bhutan border, this Boro-language film tells the story of a group of women who live alongside each other, who know each other’s business, who are sometimes in conflict and sometimes get along, but who always support each other when one of them is threatened. Wild Swans records the rhythms, intimacies, and routines of village life, and beautifully captures the lush Assam landscape. This is a story of a community of women who have learned to survive and thrive on their own, within the confines of traditional roles and overarching patriarchy. Written and directed by Rajni Basumatary, Wild Swans is warm and touching, featuring a glimpse into a culture rarely seen in cinema.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/uPV4XzzOb3IBiPSXls5NUWcBQEk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Swans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2139215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajni Basumatary","original_name":"Rajni Basumatary","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fa8e50dc1cb4013d0e19d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uPV4XzzOb3IBiPSXls5NUWcBQEk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1432}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
