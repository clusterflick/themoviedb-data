Drawn to the chase by the eerie howls of their killing song, the pack forms a single, bloodthirsty entity, bent on relentless pursuit, inevitable capture and swift, certain death.  Journey to the spectacular, isolated mountain realms of northern Spain, where the last remaining Iberian wolf pack wages a mortal battle for survival. The wolves' legendary intelligence, their lethally effective social hunting skills and awesome powers of endurance are all put to the ultimate test in a life and death struggle against man's most modern weapons... and most primitive fears.","popularity":0.3746,"poster_path":"/bnYjDavPvrBbYElKo7fYwxCY6bk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Time Warner","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Predators of the Wild: Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Hootkins","original_name":"William Hootkins","popularity":0.3708,"profile_path":"/dav2i86GN0UvYIyoTwQmGE8Nweg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64fc071cefea7a00fd19535a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4186044,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Schofield","original_name":"Peter Schofield","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc077cffc9de0edf5ec0af","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582123,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geoffrey Daniels","original_name":"Geoffrey Daniels","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc07d1db4ed610385410eb","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeremy Bradshaw","original_name":"Jeremy Bradshaw","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc0812dc1cb400b0bb13b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Michelmore","original_name":"Guy Michelmore","popularity":0.22,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc078edc1cb400e54006b1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298753,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bridget Boel","original_name":"Bridget Boel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc07e1db4ed610343dd3ab","department":"Production","job":"Executive In Charge Of Production"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Kemp","original_name":"Julia Kemp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc0744a284eb00c689649e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261987,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mike Hay","original_name":"Mike Hay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc07bddc1cb400e54006d8","department":"Crew","job":"Production Controller"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Kemp","original_name":"Richard Kemp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc0731db4ed610343dd35f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133372,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Marshall","original_name":"Howard Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc076cf85958013a8d8a68","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeremy Bradshaw","original_name":"Jeremy Bradshaw","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc080cdb4ed61032a55e15","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piers Finzel","original_name":"Piers Finzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc075fa284eb00e3f4b253","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4261989,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Graham Creelman","original_name":"Graham Creelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fc07fadb4ed610343dd3bf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3kcgM0H6GxBGawev5lgXVm8V5XF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bnYjDavPvrBbYElKo7fYwxCY6bk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1994,"name":"wolf"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
