Eine Schallplatte wird produziert","overview":"Single is not a theoretical treatise; it just uses clips to show how a single is produced. The song is Time to Love, the singers call themselves Witchcraft. Also involved are the composer, arranger, producer, the studio musicians and later on the strings.  At the beginning the off camera narrator points out a scandalous discrepancy. The film crew spent two days in the recording studio observing a three minute piece of music being produced. The film itself condenses the duration of production: 15 minutes into the film, the narrator announces that the producers are satisfied with the basic backing-track, after a four hour test. After 24 minutes we learn that the crew has left the studio after nine hours filming, whilst work on the guitar tracks continued for some hours.","popularity":0.1258,"poster_path":"/hKaRpNCN3ySGMkJlBuUgbqwJNTx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harun Farocki Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":38288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berlin-West","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Single.
