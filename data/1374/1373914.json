This practice is inspired by the forest to produce food while regenerating ecosystems. Their adventure takes them through regions as diverse as Galicia to the sea of plastics in Almería, confronting us with the severe environmental crisis that conventional agricultural practices are leading us towards.  The collection and dispersal of seeds becomes the main tool for regeneration and the backbone of this road movie,in which countless people who are also looking for a paradigm shift are immersed in. .  Full of passion and hope, these three pioneers invite us to relearn and to look at nature with new eyes. Ultimately, they show us that our ability to transform our current reality will require a steady and collective effort.","popularity":0.1178,"poster_path":"/ogEFweWmFwzhvPl4CAa3RUZp5l3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Konzéntrika Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sintrópica- Semillas de cambio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sintrópica- Seeds of change","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Otero","original_name":"Jaime Otero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67149093d5b7926e946fff47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Olaya","original_name":"Sergio Olaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"671490b00cb6252f99089ad3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diogo Santos","original_name":"Diogo Santos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"671490c30cb6252f99089ada","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel García Orive","original_name":"Miguel García Orive","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6714903ed5b7926e946fff31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010792,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel García Orive","original_name":"Miguel García Orive","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67149055650248b9db625ac7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel García Orive","original_name":"Miguel García Orive","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6714906cd5b7926e946fff3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010794,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eleonore van Wonterghem","original_name":"Eleonore van Wonterghem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6714907f0cb6252f99089ac6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1878735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ion Arenas","original_name":"Ion Arenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67149264650248b9db625b30","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Xavi Aguirre","original_name":"Xavi Aguirre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6714927a2bbba65f7b111775","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFZHFekKh4TyInbXFwoU7xVUwHk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ogEFweWmFwzhvPl4CAa3RUZp5l3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2jFlM2Qo16rMw27FwSFCFHIdJv9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":337918,"name":"agroecology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
