Sound will be mixed from each of the three along with music by Marco Testoni. Narrative slippages, abstract fugues and time-travel counterpoints collide and mingle in this fractious and riotous remake of a remake of a remake of a book adaptation. NYC manages to both evolve and stay the same over the course of 35 years.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Re)Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (x3)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Street","original_name":"Mark Street","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67143f50650248b9db624acc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
