Everest in 1953, as the first to reach the top. This achievement would have been impossible without the strength, courage and knowledge of the Sherpas, who have a strong connection to the mountains of the Himalayas. At the age of 80, Kancha is the Last of the First from the 1953 expedition to Mt. Everest. Kancha is looking into the future, with a heartfelt hope that his tradition, will reach far into the 21st century and beyond. He is concerned to see modern traditions melting away old traditions, like the snow on top of Everest.","popularity":0.2396,"poster_path":"/iht7boq5GaZRL8N2vSG18RSrdnm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Borik Production & Consulting","origin_country":""},{"id":242197,"logo_path":null,"name":"I Fokus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Kancha Sherpa: Last of the First from the 1953 Conquest of Mt Everest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kancha Sherpa","original_name":"Kancha Sherpa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6713232099f22f326aace748","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hillary","original_name":"Peter Hillary","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67132334c6e304096195af8c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lhenduk Chendok","original_name":"Lhenduk Chendok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67132347c6e304096195af9e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nawang Samden Sherpa","original_name":"Nawang Samden Sherpa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6713236cc6e304096195afae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawa Yangdu Sherpa","original_name":"Dawa Yangdu Sherpa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"671323822bbba65f7b10a63a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Borik","original_name":"Morten Borik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713228a99f22f326aace707","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Borik","original_name":"Morten Borik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713229499f22f326aace710","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009056,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruno Jørgensen","original_name":"Bruno Jørgensen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671322a799f22f326aace727","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Sangpo Borik","original_name":"Morten Sangpo Borik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671322c199f22f326aace735","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009056,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruno Jørgensen","original_name":"Bruno Jørgensen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671322d30cb6252f990828a6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Borik","original_name":"Morten Borik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671322df2bbba65f7b10a5f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Sangpo Borik","original_name":"Morten Sangpo Borik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671322ec0cb6252f990828b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009059,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolai Schou Larsen","original_name":"Nicolai Schou Larsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671323090cb6252f990828c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3060678","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgFMW0iPKSGnXQ7WAXS3enZjt0j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iht7boq5GaZRL8N2vSG18RSrdnm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":175428,"name":"adventurer"},{"id":192779,"name":"mount everest"},{"id":208611,"name":"1950s"},{"id":324768,"name":"himalaya"},{"id":341376,"name":"kancha sherpa"},{"id":341377,"name":"sir edmund hillary"},{"id":341378,"name":"tenzing norgay"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
