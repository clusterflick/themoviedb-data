Their mission was multi-faceted: to produce a documentary series, raise funds for NGOs encountered along the way, open their children's eyes to the beauty but also the fragility of the island's endemic nature, and finally to live a life of long-term, joyful simplicity. Challenges of crossing, encounters, and lessons learned will always be present in this slow-paced alternative learning journey.","popularity":0.1862,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10323,"logo_path":"/uMlnpzZGM0rWxp69JU5cuAQEJbB.png","name":"Gedeon Programmes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Walking Tour of Madagascar as a Family","title":"Madatrek","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Poussin","original_name":"Sonia Poussin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6712126c98f6a758cd549b21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Poussin","original_name":"Alexandre Poussin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6712127d98f6a758cd549b27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philaé Poussin","original_name":"Philaé Poussin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"671212b3097c3d7760f89145","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulysse Poussin","original_name":"Ulysse Poussin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6712141798f6a758cd549bd5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Poussin","original_name":"Sonia Poussin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671212d916caa8b0f09c2f72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Poussin","original_name":"Alexandre Poussin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671212e81f0ea4714edbf0fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":209463,"name":"neo-colonialism"},{"id":227583,"name":"white savior"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
