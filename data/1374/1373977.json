A story that my oldest brother Bob and I were thinking about and that I decided to make as a film school project.  I was still doing animation at the time and had been deciding on whether I could transfer my interest in painting into film.  I was a big Ray Harryhausen fan but was choosing to let go of animation so I could do more live-action films.  My brother Daniel acts in this and he also helped with the music and wardrobe and ideas of where to shoot - the outdoor shots at Villa Montalvo in Saratoga.  It's funny as I think about how the popular book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho came out six years later.  A whole other thing, of course.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/w4E4l6KzoXz0IeuiwWqxAfj8zJG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alchemist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Hernandez","original_name":"Alfred Hernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6714cdb0c6e30409619630c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w4E4l6KzoXz0IeuiwWqxAfj8zJG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
