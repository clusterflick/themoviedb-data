She is a child out of wedlock, and her mother, Lin, has been crucified ever since by everyone, seeing her as a slut, to the point that she needs to live in a psych ward and go through \"Abstinence Education for Women\". Seeing her mother suffering and being imprisoned by the moral yoke, Nianzhen develops the idea of spreading her Candidiasis, the female disease that is demonized as \"unchaste\" in East Asian society, that if everyone has it, then there is no such thing as who is chaste and who is not. Meanwhile, the coach of the badminton team at Nianzhen's school sexually harasses the girls on a regular basis. Led by Nianzhen, they think of the ultimate punishment for the coach. They begin spreading Candidiasis far and wide with their bodies—into the neighborhood pool, the sea, and the thoughts of Nianzhen's persecuted mother.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"念珠","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"曾梦笙","original_name":"曾梦笙","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713bf622bbba65f7b10cfbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
