Since then, the sun has always been his source of inspiration. Due to the extremely dense nature of the humid Amazon Rainforest, the sun does not show for long. On the shortest day of the year- ‘Winter Sol’, it becomes even more difficult to find the sun from the land. A boatman, who spends most of his day on the afloat, tries to look for the sun and engage with it. The film records their conversations. This installation intentionally omits the audio element, replacing it with a pungent smell that reminds the artist’s of the soothing yet eerie atmosphere of the Amazon forest, to create a unique artistic experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9 to 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nemil Shah","original_name":"Nemil Shah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67125f3716caa8b0f09c476f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
