The video examines issues of ethnicity, work, family, religion, and remembrance with affection and good humor. It contrasts the relatively small religious and cultural festival in Boston with the larger, older, more established ritual in Sicily, where statues of the Madonna are carried through the streets in devotion to the saint and as a way of honoring deceased family members.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moveable Feast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth Harrington","original_name":"Beth Harrington","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671282db097c3d7760f8c180","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
