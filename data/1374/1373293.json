It became a focal point of Rhine Romanticism in the 19th century, inspiring art and legends, particularly the tale of a dragon. The nearby city of Königswinter thrives on tourism, which began with English visitors in the early 19th century and was boosted by the introduction of Germany's first cogwheel railway. The fairy-tale-like Drachenburg castle, built in 1884 and recently renovated, is a major attraction. Filmmakers Clemens Gersch and Michael Wieseler document their ascent of the Drachenfels, meeting a 90-year-old photographer and a local tour guide, while also exploring the unique \"Guerilla wine\" produced in the area.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mythos Drachenfels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clemens Gersch","original_name":"Clemens Gersch","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6712bfac097c3d7760f8d56f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wieseler","original_name":"Michael Wieseler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6712bfc4097c3d7760f8d580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
