They slack off at work, hit the gym after hours, and clock in their routine every day, punctuated by sweet daydreams about their crush. It’s all very ordinary, except for one additional step they take daily: taking HIV antiretroviral medication and marking it on the calendar. This small step erects an invisible \"wall\" between them and others, built from potential fear and misunderstanding. Because of this wall, their usual desire to stand with everyone else seems somewhat unattainable, even though no one else knows it exists. The colorful routine of the external world contrasts with the lengthy seasons within their wall, creating a lonely tension. Inside the wall, in silence, they always have an unspoken cry in their heart, \"Will you still hold my hand?\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"可不可以别放手","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"大脑","original_name":"大脑","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671249ac16caa8b0f09c3da0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
