Taken off life support, his heart continues beating, and he is cryogenically frozen for the next 66 years. Awakened in the year 2069, to find his wife dead, his son an aging vegetable, and his grandson a cop, Franco pleads for the right to do what he does best: police work. Secretly hoping to bust the 99 year old Kroger, he adjusts to the complex world of the future, and learns that being a detective is easy in 2069 - as long as you like working in a police state.","popularity":2.4254,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fox Broadcasting Company","origin_country":""},{"id":9223,"logo_path":"/40qzTBM38vokoWhLKurficZ5syV.png","name":"Paramount Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":68415,"logo_path":"/hEJJjdB4UKZu7YLI83wu3SU0nke.png","name":"Steven Bochco Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NYPD 2069","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Reilly Burke","original_name":"Michael Reilly Burke","popularity":0.5954,"profile_path":"/zcvCPaOXtcNbp3yYPA9nU5sNyJq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harlan Kroger","credit_id":"6712cd0416caa8b0f09c717b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Dunn","original_name":"Kevin Dunn","popularity":0.9416,"profile_path":"/7dqLQjMNCQnuxQJQwQ5Ozz16LBq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joe Banning","credit_id":"6712cd3216caa8b0f09c7193","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giancarlo Esposito","original_name":"Giancarlo Esposito","popularity":3.7068,"profile_path":"/rcXnr82TwDzU4ZGdBeNXfG0ZQnZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lt.
