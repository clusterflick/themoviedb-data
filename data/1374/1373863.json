It makes clear, with the help of diagrams, how the sunlight, striking through shallow water, stimulates the growth of marine plants in the sea bed, providing food and a good breeding ground for the fish. Schooners built in local shipyards carry men to the fishing grounds where they transfer to dories and haul in the cod as their fathers did before them, riding the heavy Atlantic swell.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1940-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toilers of the Grand Banks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32633039","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
