He got caught when he tried to pickpocket. A kind-hearted man saw the whole situation; he offered him food and a job in his garage. That's how he changed that boy's life. After getting his salary, he was going to buy something to eat when, at that moment, he saw his friend injured and crying. He asked his friend why his friend was crying. His friend gave him the same response that he gave to the garage owner a few days ago. He fed his friend and promised to try to find him work where he already works. That's how that orphan boy attempted to change another orphan boy's life.","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":"/pBljTvQEIB3KEoYAkwhhBm90HY0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Match Cut Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"2023-05-24","revenue":2000,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunger","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5008561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raisul Islam Tamim","original_name":"Raisul Islam Tamim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rubel","credit_id":"6712c2b025c70b8b1d67e156","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2028860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shiba Ali Khan","original_name":"Shiba Ali Khan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6712c33925c70b8b1d67e1a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2028860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shiba Ali Khan","original_name":"Shiba Ali Khan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6712c3688e844657b7fb4c60","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5008568,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joseph Mehedi","original_name":"Joseph Mehedi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6712c3ba8e844657b7fb4c8e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2455,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pBljTvQEIB3KEoYAkwhhBm90HY0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
