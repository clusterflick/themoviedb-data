Kusumo and his group. They are shown in a pool of mud in a Jakarta slum, with the local population watching as the artists cover themselves entirely in mud. It's a response to an attempt at dialogue with the ecology of land and water. Humanity expresses its feelings through the body, trying to become one with the universe. It refers to the peasants who work the land and are covered in mud. It's a process of poetisation.
