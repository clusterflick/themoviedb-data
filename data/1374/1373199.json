Although these immigrants left their village for a better life, they brought strong family, religious and cultural traditions to their new home. On-location footage and personal interviews in Palermiti and in Massachusetts show the ties between the two groups of Palermitesi. Despite their success in America, many immigrants hope to return to Palermiti. In fact, some of the people in Italy have reverse-emigrated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5008071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Gulla","original_name":"Katherine Gulla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671283c825c70b8b1d67c912","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
