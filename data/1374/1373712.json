The story revolves around four children (Mila, Ryan, Diego, Kristian), aged 10-12, who live in the town of Lares. They live recklessly, vandalizing, stealing, and committing misdeeds throughout the town. Joodinni, along with his right hand Boe, a small masked girl who serves as his conscience, arrives with the purpose of guiding these children, as well as all the children and youth of Puerto Rico. However, a small but complicated setback causes his mission to be challenged by Maoro De La Cruz, a Puerto Rican entrepreneur who is bringing a group of foreigners to the island and buying dozens of residences throughout the town to take control and turn Lares into the main hub of the organized crime.","popularity":0.3179,"poster_path":"/zEupsqxxM8mW8Ds7v7OHlYlPr1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Los Media Luna
