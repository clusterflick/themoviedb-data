The text elaborates on the role of psychology in the preservation of the patriarchal system and of capitalism; it analyses the methods used by psychologists to promote adaptation to social structures rather than their dismantling. The arguments are illustrated on screen, first by shots of assembly lines and menial tasks being performed. But very soon, the shots overpower the words: images of freed bodies, of a young woman. This is Penelope, the directorâ€™s daughter, on the autism spectrum, who provides a visual escape from the implacable realities that fill our ears.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Semicolon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Doyon","original_name":"Claire Doyon","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f9458289a000caf0f78f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
