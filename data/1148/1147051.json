But edited thirty years later with Stéphane Gérard, they are also a tribute to Hervé Couergou, the beloved partner at the center of all the filmed scenes. Slowly, in conversations between couples and friends, the dandy spirit and intimate confession overlap. What emerges is a portrait of a way of dealing with the times and their pain, which, beneath the act of commemoration, seeks to inscribe a living presence.","popularity":0.5233,"poster_path":"/7s8iTtiYZQHE0VYcpSSAbZiv9fq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artistes en zones troublés","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionel Soukaz","original_name":"Lionel Soukaz","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/ixtAtAfMDnP8WkQprDtJVrulOuE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"64a17d958c0a4800ae24a3d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hervé Couergou","original_name":"Hervé Couergou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"64a17daad5191f01393e9251","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Gérard","original_name":"Stéphane Gérard","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a17dbb0cb33500c4a6818b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionel Soukaz","original_name":"Lionel Soukaz","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/ixtAtAfMDnP8WkQprDtJVrulOuE.jpg","credit_id":"64a17dc68c0a4800ae24a3ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionel Soukaz","original_name":"Lionel Soukaz","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/ixtAtAfMDnP8WkQprDtJVrulOuE.jpg","credit_id":"64a17dd78c0a48010177205b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Gérard","original_name":"Stéphane Gérard","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a17de4c390c500ca005632","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7s8iTtiYZQHE0VYcpSSAbZiv9fq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1496,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cn0Fn00TkWQViSPNJrOpqZN4f9e.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":990}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":740,"name":"aids"},{"id":9766,"name":"hiv"},{"id":240305,"name":"gay romance"},{"id":246993,"name":"video diary"},{"id":262235,"name":"hiv/aids epidemic"},{"id":265777,"name":"gay relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
