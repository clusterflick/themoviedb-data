Join Dr. Philip Prince, an expert in Appalachian geology, as he takes an in depth look at the rock structures of this region through the rare descent of Red Creek by a group of local whitewater kayakers on Cheatfest Weekend 2022. The film then explores the entire Cheat River Watershed, showcasing the world class whitewater offered in this area as a result of the unique geology of Northern West Virginia. The Red Creek Sessions is an educational documentary comparing the timeline of humanity with the timeline of geology, highlighting the rare opportunities presented to whitewater kayakers thanks to millions of years of geologic evolution.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7urHbiFhTQkl4WC8tqBJ4zyO6MP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Creek Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Prince","original_name":"Philip Prince","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Prince","credit_id":"64a42c8c8289a000ae89642d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Gunnoe","original_name":"Andrew Gunnoe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kayaker","credit_id":"64a42c978e20c500ec3d561a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick McGettigan","original_name":"Nick McGettigan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kayaker","credit_id":"64a42ca2e8d02800c5474c5e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Kossis","original_name":"Christina Kossis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kayaker","credit_id":"64a42cadd400f3010c36f1ca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Barket","original_name":"Art Barket","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kayaker","credit_id":"64a42cb9e9da6900c763fa85","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Shimrock","original_name":"Jesse Shimrock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kayaker","credit_id":"64a42cc48289a000ebe4c7eb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Mandler","original_name":"Kyle Mandler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kayaker","credit_id":"64a42ccdd400f300caacca99","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher \"Ness\" Collins","original_name":"Christopher \"Ness\" Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a42d2fd400f300caaccac9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146694,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justin Harris","original_name":"Justin Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a42d1311386c00c591cfc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Harris","original_name":"Justin Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a42d09e9da6900e40c4329","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Harris","original_name":"Justin Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a42cf5e9da6900ae2fc04f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4146695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Bauer","original_name":"Max Bauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a42d24e8d028011cf994b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7urHbiFhTQkl4WC8tqBJ4zyO6MP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Red Creek Sessions Teaser","key":"NUIiLYs67FY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-03T22:15:02.000Z","id":"64aafa18e24b930100c64be8"}]}}}
