The Artist asks the Miner for his daughter's hand in marriage, but is denied, so the young couple elope. Years pass, and the Artist becomes known for his talent, providing a good life for his wife and young child. Meanwhile, the old Miner has been crippled in an underground explosion - the flash of which is marked onscreen by two frames tinted bright red, a subtle yet effective trick conveying the shock of the blast. While in the hospital, though he has been gravely injured, the Miner still refuses to forgive the daughter he disowned.","popularity":0.135,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Williamson Kinematograph Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1906-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miner's Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Williamson","original_name":"James Williamson","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/jhvWGF6HUgzqdiD0WSI6DjS1y0W.jpg","credit_id":"64a2b20c8289a0010cec80d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
