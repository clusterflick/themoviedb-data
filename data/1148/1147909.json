Hippies advocated nonviolence and love, a popular phrase being \"Make love, not war,\" for which they were sometimes called \"flower children.\" They promoted openness and tolerance as alternatives to the restrictions and regimentation they saw in middle-class society. The movement seemed to be taking the minds of the new generation by storm... That was until one group of hippies, The Manson Family, led by Charles Manson, committed a set of crimes that terrified the world and brought the flower power movement to a halt. Charles Milles Manson was an American criminal and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California. Some of the members committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969, including the brutal murder of 8 month pregnant, actress and model Sharon Tate, wife of Roman Polanski.","popularity":0.8592,"poster_path":"/nPMFeiuFZg0WYIMIe3na5hMmP0D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Manson Murders","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2811429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Lloyd","original_name":"Glen Lloyd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64def17aa3b5e600acc2f88b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3727228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Remone Jones","original_name":"Remone Jones","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/kxrCCytI5rodFzNiJjunLaHsROZ.jpg","credit_id":"674378be703e85589d18cc50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3727228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Remone Jones","original_name":"Remone Jones","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/kxrCCytI5rodFzNiJjunLaHsROZ.jpg","credit_id":"674378c2d8db7dd1ba4571d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Aabech","original_name":"Brian Aabech","popularity":0.1926,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674378da703e85589d18cc6c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Hill","original_name":"Jordan Hill","popularity":0.1254,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674378e1703e85589d18cc7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27238438","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mnjGAzt9A0FahXUJ5YdGsIIpKOd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eE1wAbI5TuaqRmI7ulXomx0Q2ug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nPMFeiuFZg0WYIMIe3na5hMmP0D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
