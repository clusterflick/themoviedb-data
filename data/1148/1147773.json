Parkinson (1884-1970) was a prolific producer and director of “interest films”, mostly remembered for his suppressed The Life Story of Charlie Chaplin (1926) and for his films of London life. In addition he made some imaginative sing-along films, with variations of the bouncing-ball technique. This example, from the “Syncopated Melodies” series, illustrates a popular song of 1926, one of approximately 600 written by the sheet music publisher Lawrence Wright (1888-1964) under the nom-de-plume of Horatio Nicholls.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96735,"logo_path":null,"name":"H.B.
