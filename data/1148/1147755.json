After the mother disappears and one of the daughters becomes increasingly anxious to find her and take the picture, the rest of the family appears to resist any attempt to gather.  Initially presenting itself as a realistic portrayal of a family on an idle but hectic summer day, the film progressively descends into a realm where time and space lose their grip, transforming the family portrait into a solemn and enigmatic ritual of transition.","popularity":0.3438,"poster_path":"/wK7iJ57jzbEmq0Tr2USeTKQNJuy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Confusing Fantasy
