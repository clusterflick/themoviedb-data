But rats cost the farmer money and spread disease. This U.S. government training film demonstrates practical methods of rat control around farm buildings, animal feeding sites, and the homestead. The key is to cut off access to all food sources and places to hide. Methods for securing grain storage areas such as corn cribs include raising the floor off the ground, placing chew-proof metal flashing on wood edges, and adding rat-proof covers or lids.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":203463,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Communicable Disease Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rural Rat Control","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3668706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
