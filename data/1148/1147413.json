The heat and the throbbing music provide the indolent rhythm of the troubled life of Alex the cabdriver. The story is simple: New York as Hell. The noise, the sensory intrusions and the blistering heat don't stop those who can't leave from going about their business, forcing them into their own worlds sometimes to extreme degrees. Alex keeps moving, her taxi as metaphor, and waiting. Waiting is an active verb here. The sound effects, score, and chaotic images of New York captured by Robert LoScalzo come alive as the workings of Alex's interior anguish as well as the real exterior of the City.","popularity":0.2395,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":203416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skyward Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4144854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Pruitt","original_name":"Cynthia Pruitt","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cabdriver","credit_id":"64a2ca76d400f3010c36242b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Rice","original_name":"William Rice","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":"/q4XNpwIOiqOebtyDea99dLRkAnO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Preacher","credit_id":"64a2ca92d400f3012d43ce2c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irma St. Paule","original_name":"Irma St. Paule","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/qtJmKcPHbTyveOE2NhLcsU04KUF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Passenger","credit_id":"64a2ca9cd400f300caac05e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Brent","original_name":"Doris Brent","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Passenger","credit_id":"64a2caa7e9da6900c7632c66","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie Zastawna","original_name":"Nellie Zastawna","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Passenger","credit_id":"64a2cab2e8d028013915e4a6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lorne Morris","original_name":"Lorne Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2cb248e20c5012e89dd29","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4144857,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rob Loscalzo","original_name":"Rob Loscalzo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2cb17e9da69010146db3c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843456,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Keenan","original_name":"Michael Keenan","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2cb0ae8d02800e2d78982","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843456,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Keenan","original_name":"Michael Keenan","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2caf68289a0012d28af29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098163","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
