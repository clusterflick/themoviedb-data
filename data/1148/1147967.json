The film explores the eroticism and latent violence of his paintings, as well as his masterly treatment of landscape and flowers. The myth of paedophilia that has hung like a shadow over his life and work is blown apart by testimony from artists and art historians, as well as by one of his former child models. Balthus is revealed to be an original, whose life and work have been driven by matters much deeper than shock value or sex.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balthus the Painter (1908-2001)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kidel","original_name":"Mark Kidel","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a44c21e8d02800e2d859d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
