It's a perfect excuse to poke fun at republicanism and egalitarianism. Eric Donkin plays the campy and comical Duke of Plaza-Toro who has incorporated and sold himself as blue-chip stock; Douglas Chamberlain is in dag as the Duchess; Richard McMillan plays the leering and lecherous Grand Inquisitor, Don Alhambra. John Keane and Paul Massel are Marco and Giuseppe, the fun-loving gondoliers who discover on their wedding day that one of them is the rightful King of Barataria.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ix5WDGvd9iZoDjFecdWKfkVqtYX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gondoliers: Gilbert and Sullivan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ix5WDGvd9iZoDjFecdWKfkVqtYX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
