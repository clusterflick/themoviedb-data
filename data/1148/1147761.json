H. Squires' Celeste Octet","overview":"In this incomplete print, Squire promises a “Cook’s Tour” of Russia, India, Italy, Finland, and Ireland. Russia is represented by Rimsky-Korsakov’s Scheherazade, India by Amy Woodford-Finden’s ballad “Pale Hands I Loved Beside the Shalimar”. Bizarrely, a snatch of Mozart’s overture to Le Nozze di Figaro, set in Seville, appears to represent Italy. Lost footage robs us of Finland, and most of Ireland too.","popularity":0.0497,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":113094,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Forest Phonofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1928-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J.
