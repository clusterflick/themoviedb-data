It seems unlikely that this was just an improvisational filming session: the dancer changed costumes for each of the numbers. Beautifully shot, these represent the finest record of the legendary dancer, who, alongside Nijinsky and Karsavina, astounded Paris in the first Ballets Russes season.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Douglas Fairbanks Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna Pavlova","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1107950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Pavlova","original_name":"Anna Pavlova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/39kyAvHcnB2gXNTzSUYwyn3SuKP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66db070221a9cc7d92c5e406","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
