It's a unique movie filled with surprises. It's a dance-comedy about mouth guards. It's an anti-drug story that's funny. It's charming and independent and everything Hollywood is not. It's Steps, a film that draws its inspiration from the Marx Brother to Monty Python and it was done on such a shoe-string budget, it would make a studio executive blush.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/5boIv8I00S3UzmhpW23BFlSnBXX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A charming independent story of drugs, dancing, singing, comedy and even the occasional \"spitting\".","title":"Shteps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5boIv8I00S3UzmhpW23BFlSnBXX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
