He has a serious medical condition, a consequence of his presumably promiscuous lifestyle. The gay scene in Berlin is highly sex-orientated, and Edu works occasionally works at the local sauna. There are ample opportunities for him to meet as many partners as he like. But the consequences of these encounters can be destructive. To make things worse, Amazon has not paid his health insurance, leaving him in a vulnerable and indeed embarrassing situation. What a pain in the arse. Quite literally.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/wfoIHk1SA3T3pTIvygzOvJ0vQuG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema
