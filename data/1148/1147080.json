The film was shot in connection with Leonid Filatov's unfinished game picture \"The Adventures of Tolik Paramonov\" based on his novel \"Freedom or Death\" (a Soviet dissident leaves for the West and becomes a communist there). The film was put into production in 1993 at the Rossfilm studio, but a serious illness prevented the director from finishing the production. The desire to acquaint the viewer with this work was the purpose of creating this project.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ohe3Yk4hjTQz8CQCZixnEVsyHIH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2000-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Don't Fly Like That, Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"О, не лети так жизнь...
