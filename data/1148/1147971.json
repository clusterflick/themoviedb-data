For so many generations, the land has nourished, cared for and raised us. It has inspired our language, our culture, our lifeway and our vision of the world. Throughout the seasons, our ancestors criss-crossed the territory on foot, by canoe or on snowshoes. They knew every river, lake, or stream; every mountain, hill or bog; every camp, trail and portage path. Nomadism forged our people, and the film will record this journey and our history – past, present and future. And while it will attest to our vitality and resilience it is also – and above all – a tribute and a message of respect for the Earth.","popularity":0.1491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104613,"logo_path":"/oQFsGgUZK1C5Lk5FXtQevYKHqSu.png","name":"Terre Innue","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Nitassinan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970082,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michel Giroux","original_name":"Michel Giroux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a44d13e9da69013b789262","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2859453,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandre Bacon","original_name":"Alexandre Bacon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4JgXBMtuwjPij3duy54u6jzKJll.jpg","credit_id":"64a44d6f8289a000ae89736f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2281533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joséphine Bacon","original_name":"Joséphine Bacon","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/A6BvRj3KgyKPYjHtwdesmeVWCiO.jpg","credit_id":"64a44c9f8289a000caf1b3ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elodie Pollet","original_name":"Elodie Pollet","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a44d23e9da6900c7640989","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","original_name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1XpngtObJiZv0rM08bBU3HkiSOx.jpg","credit_id":"64a44d62e9da6900ae2fcef2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437619,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Fortin","original_name":"Sarah Fortin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a44c9511386c00fffa6bc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2096336,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maxime Pilon-Lalande","original_name":"Maxime Pilon-Lalande","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a44d0811386c0139af1f8c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florent Vollant","original_name":"Florent Vollant","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/4CxdkPjopLwSwUzRvsy2OidLrwk.jpg","credit_id":"64a44d778e20c500ae13da90","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zlMUx4jFN1WU6qa1lgwVd6HQn99.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
