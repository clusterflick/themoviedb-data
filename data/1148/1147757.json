But when civil war breaks out this idyll of existence is devastated as the community is broken and homes destroyed. We follow the fortunes of a father, mother and their three teenage children – Leto, Mati and Tana – who face this brutal reality together. They are confronted with impossible choices in order to survive. They must leave their homeland and undertake a perilous journey to safer shores. Along the way they will be separated from each other and have to persevere alone.","popularity":0.6797,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":538,"logo_path":"/oGpxL5lFf8VpWsAQ6tut0on25LW.png","name":"EMI Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Royal Opera House: Message in a Bottle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sting","original_name":"Sting","popularity":0.7867,"profile_path":"/y6gpCAf6LTHcqFXEZ2udXJkucAm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self -
