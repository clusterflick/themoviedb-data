In transit through the city, Malik and his friends, miners of Moroccan origin, try to reach Europe by any means necessary.  Day after night, they are up to no good, running the city in all directions, turning it upside down like a glove, like seismographs revealing the most burning present like the movements of the most distant past, taking all the risks to cross the barriers, to cross the waters of the port, climbing on the boats…  Stay there, as if dead before being born? Rather \"burn the sea\" than die before having lived.","popularity":0.3457,"poster_path":"/tBp2Er86DDapslla7z0MtcO1QhS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182378,"logo_path":"/p0Gln1KFm9U7iGaERZ7gG5y2jU8.png","name":"Alina Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":242544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noir Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obscure Night - Goodbye Here, Anywhere","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain George","original_name":"Sylvain George","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2a8178e20c5014f2a4bd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain George","original_name":"Sylvain George","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcedfbb3f1281d7c5951fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28379450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tBp2Er86DDapslla7z0MtcO1QhS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":892,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tUNWX1ZfZ788hO011e509I8UsdE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Obscure night  Goodbye here, anywhere | Trailer oficial FICCALI 2023","key":"bC3TiBymuWo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-20T00:23:54.000Z","id":"66fcee6dc6fbb2f0cdf235b5"}]}}}
