Whatever it is, the 24-hour race at Le Mans has become a legend; for the driver, just to finish is an achievement; for the fans, to be there is a unique experience. For the race marshals and police there is little chance to relax, for when tragedy strikes it can be swift and terrible. Last year, during one of the hottest weekends in the history of the race, reporter Jack Pizzey joined the 250,000 spectators. He followed the fortunes of two British entrants. One was Guy Edwards, the former Grand Prix driver who made the headlines when he rescued Niki Lauda from a blazing wreck in 1976. Now he is one of the most successful businessmen-drivers on the road racing circuit. The other was Alain de Cadenet, who with little backing has made 11 attempts, and is dedicated to winning Le Mans.","popularity":0.2372,"poster_path":"/qkIiO36GYFWHW7qybfU3tzR0fp1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24
