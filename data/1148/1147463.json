Inside Sheffield Railway Men's Club former steam locomotive crew discuss the transition from steam to electric and diesel engines, and heatedly debate their respective merits. Meanwhile, on the Manchester-Sheffield line a former steam locomotive driver remembers what it was like to go through the Woodhead Tunnel, where driver and fireman had to crouch down to avoid the fumes and get breathable air. Signalman Michael Gatonby reveals life inside the signal box, one of the loneliest and busiest jobs on the railway line.","popularity":0.163,"poster_path":"/hjqv6oiBDmjqJfQeigeBVTxrpLj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Engines Must Not Enter the Potato Siding","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Tuesday Documentary: Engines Must Not Enter the Potato Siding","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3383391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Snowdon","original_name":"Roger Snowdon","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64a2f45f8e20c5010d4e28af","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Brown","original_name":"Malcolm Brown","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f4758e20c5014f2a6ee7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Brown","original_name":"Malcolm Brown","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f4828289a0010cec9f79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4145105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terry Coleman","original_name":"Terry Coleman","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f499e9da69011e57aaac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4145106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Len Newsom","original_name":"Len Newsom","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f4bcd400f300ad85b4b8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139634,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ken Morse","original_name":"Ken Morse","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f4efe8d02800c5469653","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721273,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Geoff Tookey","original_name":"Geoff Tookey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f5308e20c500cbec1bbe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877098,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Simpson","original_name":"Dave Simpson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f53ad400f300caac1936","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4145107,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Barber","original_name":"Peter Barber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a2f5508e20c5014f2a6f3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aoJQMzpwBGD2etbMUmQ5gI0F7QH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hjqv6oiBDmjqJfQeigeBVTxrpLj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
