She is casually dating Karl Benson, a private eye and former cop. Merle mentions in passing that one of her boss's patients is an author with recurring dreams of murdering his wife, and she includes the fact that the wife owns valuable jewels. When the wife is found murdered in a manner identical to that of her husband's dream, the husband is naturally the prime suspect. But as the investigation of the police and insurance investigator Joe Cooper proceeds, it turns out that several people in the case, including Merle, are not what they seem.","popularity":1.7227,"poster_path":"/r9mYnW3zhuRrb5iFZXJnwGerYqH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a smiling \"Lady Killer\" who knew how to \"handle\" women!","title":"Manhandled","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Lamour","original_name":"Dorothy Lamour","popularity":0.4016,"profile_path":"/3z4VGZQqGFX4vbOcLRp8lsHaw6E.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Merl Kramer","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sterling Hayden","original_name":"Sterling Hayden","popularity":0.8895,"profile_path":"/eRKaKeHjMKjNPOuENLccfVuyfVm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Joe Cooper","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Duryea","original_name":"Dan Duryea","popularity":0.3721,"profile_path":"/tfX2o7EBXRbJhCrVKnSfvfPSG0K.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Karl Benson","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Hervey","original_name":"Irene Hervey","popularity":0.1638,"profile_path":"/aWaApYfZh2ROdh4V3dWDphJHYx1.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ruth / Mrs. Alton Bennet","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Reed","original_name":"Phillip Reed","popularity":0.1845,"profile_path":"/7KiNR0zuBmPfacXq5znhiGPEWKZ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Guy Bayard","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f97","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Vermilyea","original_name":"Harold Vermilyea","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/6ruYGK31R5ZwDtkQLAZPa2IJdNw.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Dr. Redman","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f9b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Napier","original_name":"Alan Napier","popularity":0.516,"profile_path":"/90TwBLqH94JqWeVBXqkkYR2wsp2.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Alton Bennet","credit_id":"52fe45eb9251416c91042f9f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Smith","original_name":"Art Smith","popularity":0.1618,"profile_path":"/pZUgwEf3x0yHRuwRv5ys42FpZC9.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Detective Lt.
