Now living in Cottbus, an economically depressed place where the people are not too fond of things like American culture and foreigners living in their country, Georg soon falls in with a group of angry mates. Together the group delves further into a nationalist way of thinking, and soon they are shaving their heads, and becoming a skinhead gang. \"Kombat Sechzehn\" features some impressive, proffessional looking fight sequences, as well as a memorable soundtrack.","popularity":0.5124,"poster_path":"/b7HOa0XMxkyRJuABxXV2tx5eMWI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1748,"logo_path":null,"name":"credofilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Combat
