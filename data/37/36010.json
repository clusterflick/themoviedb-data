Today, nearly 500,000 Americans are imprisoned on drug charges. In 1980 the number was 50,000. Last year $40 billion in taxpayer dollars were spent in fighting the war on drugs. As a result of the incarceration obsession, the United States operates the largest prison system on the planet. Today, 89 percent of police departments have paramilitary units, and 46 percent have been trained by active duty armed forces. The most common use of paramilitary units is serving drug-related search warrants, which usually involve no-knock entries into private homes.","popularity":0.4887,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War on Drugs: The Prison Industrial Complex","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115570,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristina Berio","original_name":"Cristina Berio","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45c79251416c9103e215","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Services"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Homs","original_name":"Marc Homs","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45c79251416c9103e21b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Wiering","original_name":"Frank Wiering","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45c79251416c9103e20f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":3391,"name":"drug smuggling"},{"id":1601,"name":"war on drugs"},{"id":2019,"name":"liberation of prisoners"},{"id":2149,"name":"drug trafficking"},{"id":4269,"name":"war on freedom"},{"id":11494,"name":"drug use"},{"id":9890,"name":"jail"},{"id":10776,"name":"marijuana"},{"id":11048,"name":"legalization"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
