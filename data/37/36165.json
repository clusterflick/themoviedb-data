Tommy’s rage and wounds frighten his seven-year-old daughter Josephine. When Tommy’s wife tells him to leave and never come home, Tommy disappears back into the CIA, employing his skills as a spy to covertly watch his only daughter grow up.Twenty-five years later, Tommy Sparrow finally comes in from the cold – to retirement. Josephine is battling her own destructive nature and the damage done by the disappearance of her father. Tommy carries his scars both inside and out – and while his cold war operations never seem far behind, Tommy’s journey home will surpass any mission he ran with the Agency – because reuniting with Josephine and becoming her father may cost him his life.","popularity":1.1755,"poster_path":"/dEjgdlTmZ69dDmrnUB96GoLsQdX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crimes
