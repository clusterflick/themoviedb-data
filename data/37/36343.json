A Discovery Channel Quest expedition led by Dr. Joann Fletcher and a team of internationally renowned scientists from the University of York Mummy Research Team hopes to find out. If they find her, it will be one of the greatest archaeological discoveries since Nefertiti's stepson, King Tutankhamen, was discovered in 1922.  The \"Great Royal Wife\" of the renegade Akhenaten, Nefertiti was a mother of six who helped lead a religious revolution that changed Egypt and the world forever. Yet after her death, her enemies destroyed all evidence of her life.  Now, drawing on 13 years of research, Fletcher and her team bring Nefertiti's turbulent reign to life like never before with cutting-edge computer animations to recreate ancient Egypt's great temples, x-rays to reveal the telltale signs of foul play on her mummy, and forensic graphics to recreate the mummy's face.","popularity":0.5862,"poster_path":"/l75p0vwDUauMJaDbCa9jV3g0sYu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have they found the ancient world's greatest beauty?","title":"Nefertiti: Resurrected","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Nefertiti Revealed","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Tunie","original_name":"Tamara Tunie","popularity":1.1615,"profile_path":"/1KM30uSzeB27UEY7ICtTVDf16CQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe45e09251416c91041809","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joann Fletcher","original_name":"Joann Fletcher","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/2adidLfh0JDSo5CrACJnIVOYYOA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe45e09251416c9104180d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Yates","original_name":"Jason Yates","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aknahaten","credit_id":"52fe45e09251416c91041811","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Wortman","original_name":"Matthew Wortman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6hbt5dT3OPmCYubTCWsYNjGq7QV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe45e09251416c91041805","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351328,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Colin Clarke","original_name":"Colin Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b2356c4581990058cbfac1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Johnston","original_name":"Mark Johnston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b236bdc490480040f99642","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Vickerage","original_name":"Michael Vickerage","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b235e0c09e99006f8ac13f","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Geffen","original_name":"Anthony Geffen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b2365b57d3780059802692","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shaun Trevisick","original_name":"Shaun Trevisick","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b235fba0664500413db6e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107450,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Botting","original_name":"Kate Botting","popularity":0.0572,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b2364662e86f002b3b04cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770344,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lisa Harney","original_name":"Lisa Harney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b23581dd926a006d85be64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22365,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"W.
