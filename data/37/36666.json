The filmmakers relay the experiences and painful recollections of these now-elderly survivors of the rails. Forced to travel more by economic necessity than the spirit of adventure, the film's subjects dispel romantic myths of a hobo existence and its corresponding veneer of freedom. Riding the Rails recounts the hoboes' trade secrets for survival and accounts of dank miseries, loneliness, imprisonment, death, and dispossession. Sixty years later, the filmmakers transport their subjects back to the tracks, where the surging impact of sound and movement resuscitates memories of a shattered adolescence and devastating rite of passage.","popularity":0.4923,"poster_path":"/yn1DaqiyLa34lxDPveS9LmSUSgr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riding the Rails","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Thomas","original_name":"Richard Thomas","popularity":2.2048,"profile_path":"/yLV41csipJfb7qF135vD4Wu7VQH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe45ff9251416c9104598f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lexy Lovell","original_name":"Lexy Lovell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45ff9251416c91045985","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Uys","original_name":"Michael Uys","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45ff9251416c9104598b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025271,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Sharp","original_name":"Howard Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45ff9251416c9104599b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107835,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Henriques","original_name":"Sam Henriques","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59513622c3a36814ae00e12c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0120017","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yn1DaqiyLa34lxDPveS9LmSUSgr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5571,"name":"great depression"},{"id":155809,"name":"riding the rail"},{"id":214548,"name":"1930s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
