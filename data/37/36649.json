To make matters worse, big engines Gordon and James side with the ill-tempered lifter and the little guys get nervous and begin making mistakes on the job. They redeem themselves, however, when Cranky topples in a storm and Thomas and his buddy put him back upright. Other stories feature twin engines Bill and Ben having \"teething troubles,\" Toad the brake van's forward-thinking ambition, grumpy Gordon crashing through a station wall, and storyteller Alec Baldwin adopting a falsetto as Lady Hatt, Sir Topham Hatt's wife and birthday girl. In lieu of a seventh story, a chorus of kids sings \"Night Train\" while the model trains steam through darkness in a series of dramatic scenarios.","popularity":0.6138,"poster_path":"/7tSE0BbXmoGfl4bCm7MM4WI658i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"PEEP!
