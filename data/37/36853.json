He also introduces and provides a running commentary on four other sideshow performers: Mr. Lifto, who can lift and swing heavy objects from various body piercings, the Torture King, who turns himself into a human pincushion, the Enigma, who swallows worms, crickets, and swords, and Matt \"The Tube\" Crowley, who ingests various things into his nose, mouth, and stomach and bring them back out. The crowd goes wild.","popularity":0.1606,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jim Rose Circus Sideshow","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0145857","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190370,"name":"erotic movie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
