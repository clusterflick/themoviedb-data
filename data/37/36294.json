Several of the most dangerous, all killers, will be transported by train to Santa Ana, a new high tech prison for the worst of the worst. Included in this transfer are: -Ian Kelly, explosions expert who has set off terrorist bombings worldwide. -Lorenzo \"Enzo\" Martini, a mafia kingpin who enjoyed nationwide fame before finally being put away. -Karl \"The Killer\" Miller, a serial killer with absolutely no conscience and an unquenchable thirst for blood. -Tommy \"Zimm\" Zimmer, a man who's serving life for killing his wife and her lover. -Luke Sinclair, who's finishing up the last nine months of a fifteen-year sentence for killing the man who murdered his wife. When the prisoners, under heavy security, board the last car of the train, it quickly becomes clear that an escape plan has been hatched","popularity":2.3484,"poster_path":"/xLz9EK5AyEbiHZ2SiGebU9Lfj2O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Oaks Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evasive Action","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Evasión sin límite","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Con Train","type":"TV"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Steel Train","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorian Harewood","original_name":"Dorian Harewood","popularity":0.5789,"profile_path":"/j3Nc0uNpe3MkonLtOrzVegO22QO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luke Sinclair","credit_id":"52fe45dc9251416c91040f0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Wise","original_name":"Ray Wise","popularity":1.2505,"profile_path":"/qUGDdBfPkDQYZR46wuNxMO1UM2K.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheriff Wes Blaidek","credit_id":"52fe45dc9251416c91040f0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Scheider","original_name":"Roy Scheider","popularity":1.0136,"profile_path":"/y0MTwkCm5fIKjM1xH90tZbjAHql.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Enzo Marcelli","credit_id":"52fe45dc9251416c91040f13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delane Matthews","original_name":"Delane Matthews","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/lsPBf5ptBopzXZ4nL8UNBnpN1GR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Zoe Clark","credit_id":"52fe45dc9251416c91040f17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Coogan","original_name":"Keith Coogan","popularity":0.6116,"profile_path":"/vqOs0xsxJ5oxpl7A0cZREWIf773.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Anthony Tait","credit_id":"66871bc893b23a25d76d00ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clint Howard","original_name":"Clint Howard","popularity":2.5729,"profile_path":"/evKE2FU7RJg0zJEwSFvGvkFB3vq.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hector Miller","credit_id":"5cca3042c3a36847dd8488cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed O'Ross","original_name":"Ed O'Ross","popularity":0.5077,"profile_path":"/6hzovUAs5hFcrZvPdk84NR3KcHU.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Warden Jack Kramer","credit_id":"60cf15c20021340029e6f4cb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Swayze","original_name":"Don Swayze","popularity":0.8748,"profile_path":"/lewJdPYpyb8sacBQWLAJFNhpeAU.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Ian Kellen","credit_id":"5cca30500e0a2633d0f483f0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Van Patten","original_name":"Dick Van Patten","popularity":0.5143,"profile_path":"/hkFv87D7bGEDSw4PoJcEj8I2jRn.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Parole Officer","credit_id":"5cca30600e0a2604b5ed5f57","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rance Howard","original_name":"Rance Howard","popularity":0.8994,"profile_path":"/rYejoZAvgvy0jyRu9fMH9PBKOWM.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Train Engineer","credit_id":"5cca3098c3a368282088ec0f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam J.
