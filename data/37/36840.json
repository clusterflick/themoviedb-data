Yet despite his failing health and the seeming impossibility of the task, Hawking is still devoted to his work; an extraordinary drive that's captured here in fleeting interview snippets and footage of the scientist sharing a microwave dinner with some fawning PhD students. Though the pop-science tutorials that dapple the first of this two-part biography are winningly perky, Hawking, alas, remains as tricky to fathom as his boggling quantum whatnots","popularity":2.5828,"poster_path":"/pKrYWbAkD9wWokIKG1L2F6WDCU9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A mind-expanding view of the big picture","title":"Stephen Hawking and The Theory of Everything","video":false,"vote_average":7.643,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Hawking","original_name":"Stephen Hawking","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/zcngJdU6f4qKiKYFocM9ANJxGXt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46109251416c91047d63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":116366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Penrose","original_name":"Roger Penrose","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/l9Wnd2ZOecWWXxGP7wdBu9k4zfC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46109251416c91047d67","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Johnstone","original_name":"Gary Johnstone","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46109251416c91047d6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/pKrYWbAkD9wWokIKG1L2F6WDCU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fJPstvMOxNhaD5dhmP9SZ3J7fsQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2878,"name":"scientific study"},{"id":6012,"name":"physics"},{"id":8012,"name":"physicist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
