Let the Waffen-SS search for Atlantis and dance around Germanic Druid Stones - who believes in the occult of \"Wunderwaffen\" or \"miracle weapons\" anyway?

Secretly shot films? Evidence? What is really happening in Kottlitz Castle? Who killed Smokey Savallas? What kind of research is the \"Ahnenerbe der SS\" involved in?
