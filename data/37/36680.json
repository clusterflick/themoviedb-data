Technocalyps is an intriguing three-part documentary on the notion of transhumanism by Belgian visual artist and filmmaker Frank Theys. The latest findings in genetics, robotics, artificial intelligence, bionics and nanotechnology appear in the media every day, but with no analysis of their common aim: that of exceeding human limitations. The director conducts his enquiry into the scientific, ethical and metaphysical dimensions of technological development.","popularity":0.5006,"poster_path":"/3e3hJWUw3Ba4VtJk7m7YdiI25dp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are we prepared for dealing with the prospect that humanity is not the end of evolution?","title":"TechnoCalyps","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence McKenna","original_name":"Terence McKenna","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/9oSXQwNy9EjCQ6ONhohfNzKHlje.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46019251416c91045d87","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Theys","original_name":"Frank Theys","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46019251416c91045d65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francisco López","original_name":"Francisco López","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46019251416c91045d71","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115900,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Theys","original_name":"Frank Theys","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46019251416c91045d6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066759,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Renson","original_name":"Chris Renson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d49ce02b37bb4977a98b47","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066757,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phyllis Digneffe","original_name":"Phyllis Digneffe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d49ce9e9e5846a3f02a12a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066758,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rian Koopman","original_name":"Rian Koopman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d49cf1e9e5846a3f02a132","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0899298","wikidata_id":"Q21161358","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zpc7t2kVRSiIbElfSRdtiRz5r6P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3e3hJWUw3Ba4VtJk7m7YdiI25dp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":310,"name":"artificial intelligence (a.i.)"},{"id":12375,"name":"transhumanism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Technocalyps","key":"4nkVFAaNToU","published_at":"2006-09-22T08:25:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec696c3a368544800451f"}]}}}
