The hand is weathered, the fingers cracked and scarred. The end of a rifle appears and a shot fires. The bullet is visible whirling through space; it caroms and then goes through a pine cone. A long spoon emerges from a drawer in the chair and stretches toward the hand. The bullet is on the spoon. Later, the hand holds the bullet between two fingers; another shot is fired.","popularity":0.1403,"poster_path":"/7KRHdwzumppLhSdc5r7DkYSiQXy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Koninck","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stille Nacht III: Tales from Vienna Woods","video":false,"vote_average":5.938,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tales from the Vienna Woods (Stille Nacht III)","type":"DVD Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"スティル・ナハト３ウィーンの深い森の中","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ae4c3a36847f81e735d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ae4c3a36847f81e7363","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0352901","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lolekiAv3Zmlh921xAxZduZpw4q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7KRHdwzumppLhSdc5r7DkYSiQXy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4m1nI4l3LP08cFD9r5u1xvRZ920.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Annecy Film Festival)","release_date":"1993-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
