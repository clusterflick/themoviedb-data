Three sold-out concerts were held in April 2010 at the Hong Kong Coliseum - their first concerts there in over four years - and fans from around the world came to show their unwavering support. Twins performed their new songs (the concert theme song \"Everyone Bounces Up\" and \"Growth\") as well as early hits like \"Our Memorial Album\", \"Next Stop, Diva\", and \"Kite and Wind\". Gillian and Charlene also sang their own solo favorites in addition to duets with guest performers Joey Yung, Leo Koo, Boy'z, and Wong Cho Lam. Remarkably entertaining and bringing back lots of memories, the Twins concert is captured in its entirety on Blu-ray with karaoke feature.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Twins Hong Kong Group Singer","title":"Twins Live Karaoke 2010","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
