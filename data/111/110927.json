In his class, Ivan is provoked by a student and ends up slapping him on the face. In Serbia, in the heat of transitional changes, Ivan’s presence in school is no longer welcomed. He finds a temporary job opportunity in a war-scarred mountain village in Bosnia.  On his way there, he meets Yasmina, a young Muslim woman, back from Germany to her homeland after the war and after being invited by an old friend – Hazim - who now runs a motel.  A lone kiss in a stormy night, in a village still lying in ruins, will bring Yasmina and Ivan closer together in a joint escape from reality and to a ride on a dusty bus, where neither one of them wants to sit next to the window.","popularity":0.3009,"poster_path":"/auy5fpgKB69NDifn0gcPtJMq3vI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komuna","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":68801,"logo_path":null,"name":"VizArt","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2011-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motel Nana","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragan Mićanović","original_name":"Dragan Mićanović","popularity":0.3396,"profile_path":"/1KVYAxi8hUZ9T6qqYJb3U3a028U.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Ivan","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8515","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolina Đorđević","original_name":"Nikolina Đorđević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Jasmina (as Nikolina Djordjevic)","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8519","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zijah Sokolović","original_name":"Zijah Sokolović","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/7nyonQIdhQn19w3XEFkMUtyZP2g.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Hazim","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e851d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikola Pejaković","original_name":"Nikola Pejaković","popularity":0.1645,"profile_path":"/hqVG1DKBDxGaJbbi1rTQIA3LVkv.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Domar","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8521","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mladen Nelević","original_name":"Mladen Nelević","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Direktor skole","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8525","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ljubivoje Tadić","original_name":"Ljubivoje Tadić","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Profesor matematike","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8529","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragana Nenadić","original_name":"Dragana Nenadić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Profesorka","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e852d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miloš Pjevač","original_name":"Miloš Pjevač","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Ucenik","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8531","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivera Viktorović","original_name":"Olivera Viktorović","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/rPyk4Dk6utKajXIDM6HeoEDUFgU.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Sankerica","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8535","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Predrag Velinović","original_name":"Predrag Velinović","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/hliuaiHXvIsSWuBCO6zGJm92kYS.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e850b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85652,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ranko Božić","original_name":"Ranko Božić","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aeac3a36847f81e8511","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1517220","wikidata_id":"Q12755756","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/auy5fpgKB69NDifn0gcPtJMq3vI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
