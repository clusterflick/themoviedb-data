But, on Sunday the sun must shine, on Monday Mr. Mohn must come to visit, on Tuesday Taschenbier must go on duty, Wednesday is just there, there must be the middle of the week, but Thursday is difficult, because there must be thunder, and Friday must be a day off. But one day it works out, the Sams is back and the wishing machine works. But now one disaster after another happens.","popularity":0.2023,"poster_path":"/5QIUbbcIDjUlhUxWmijWArZ8dp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Augsburger Puppenkiste","origin_country":""},{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Augsburger Puppenkiste - Am Samstag kam das Sams zurück","video":true,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Sams - Am Samstag kam das Sams zurück","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Am Samstag kam das Sams zurück","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst H.
