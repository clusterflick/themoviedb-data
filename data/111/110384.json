Again and again, Dominik Graf reads passages from this account and, by juxtaposing them with clips from Storz’s films, reveals the echoes of the past they contain. Whether in his more experimental television plays or his Willy Brandt film \"Im Schatten der Macht\", Storz always provided new perspectives on the war and on Germany itself. Via a series of personal interviews Graf held with the journalist, director and producer shortly before the latter’s death in summer 2011, we are introduced to an analytical, unconventional man who witnessed the course of history. Graf takes up Storz’s reflections in his commentary, throwing light on an unexpected history of German television.","popularity":0.1516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1884,"logo_path":"/mcxDLLEaK0tmsosMZBLueLLfoU2.png","name":"Megaherz Film und Fernsehen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lawinen der Erinnerung","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Storz","original_name":"Oliver Storz","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67caac51a001960f78cb5e71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Kruijssen","original_name":"Eva Kruijssen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lore/SS-Frau","credit_id":"67caabbadba14916062b4aec","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Graf","original_name":"Dominik Graf","popularity":0.2632,"profile_path":"/bVkXsyYYLPvDda1o7LQsWGQAWKn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad4c3a36847f81e3e17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Graf","original_name":"Dominik Graf","popularity":0.2632,"profile_path":"/bVkXsyYYLPvDda1o7LQsWGQAWKn.jpg","credit_id":"67caaaf3a001960f78cb5dfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48193,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martin Farkas","original_name":"Martin Farkas","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caab36dba14916062b4ad2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223373,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rolf Wilhelm","original_name":"Rolf Wilhelm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caab6e54783caaa3afd54b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163675,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sven Rossenbach","original_name":"Sven Rossenbach","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caab87a001960f78cb5e31","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian van Volxem","original_name":"Florian van Volxem","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caab9d54783caaa3afd565","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":21096,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fidelis Mager","original_name":"Fidelis Mager","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caacb054783caaa3afd5ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5288379,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna-Julia Geyer","original_name":"Anna-Julia Geyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caacd2dcc9c03ff0cb5bea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Franz Xaver Gernstl","original_name":"Franz Xaver Gernstl","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/gmdgMFY1Dpd5ftv7KOLWVuWVTVI.jpg","credit_id":"67caace636598226a1afd7c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2203835","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin, IFF - Forum","release_date":"2012-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte","release_date":"2012-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
