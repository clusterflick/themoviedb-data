As he arrives (still trying to learn the native language via recordings), Professor Tibbetts is tricked into sneaking a gin still into the country by a local prince. Later, Tibbetts makes his way to Kombooli High, where his students wear Eton collars alongside their native garb and Tibbetts finds himself sporting a mortarboard and safari shorts due to the heat. When the Commissioner falls ill with a dose of malaria, Tibbetts is forced to take over his duties, which include collecting the taxes. Upriver, he finds an old paddlesteamer operated by Harbottle (Moore Marriott) and Albert (Graham Moffatt) and the threesome rescue a baby from death by sacrifice.","popularity":0.4807,"poster_path":"/vp0bTCCgRtyKcCOQFSFxWzMfgCZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1938-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Bones of the River","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Hay","original_name":"Will Hay","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/6dQ6oCFt4UeXVsOiOswFmWevgIg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Prof. Benjamin Tibbetts","credit_id":"52fe4ad7c3a36847f81e48ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moore Marriott","original_name":"Moore Marriott","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/cZbIuKVbBKjsRQyFdHZ2dl7DsJF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jerry Harbottle","credit_id":"52fe4ad7c3a36847f81e48f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Moffatt","original_name":"Graham Moffatt","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/yo2rQYuJKZYifqg8LHseyi4ADDY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Albert Brown","credit_id":"52fe4ad7c3a36847f81e48f7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Varnel","original_name":"Marcel Varnel","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/hkiDy9IRHxpMBBwhCwBGkeAteVd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad7c3a36847f81e48fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21603,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alfred Roome","original_name":"Alfred Roome","popularity":0.0649,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1f0eb594d8a849843d5186","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0030518","wikidata_id":"Q12126717","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/czZ6CX63CYKGj8UCZIpkkAsdaHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":987,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vp0bTCCgRtyKcCOQFSFxWzMfgCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
