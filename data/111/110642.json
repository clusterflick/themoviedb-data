The four suspects are Ankit Sharma, his school-going brother, Dhruv; Rohan Goverdhan Malhotra, and Bulai. The suspects ridicule them and mockingly ask the guards to let them go. A check of their belongings, including a video camera, shows pictures of prominent places, prompting Om Prakash to summon Vijay D. Chauhan, from the Anti-Terrorist Squad. The latter shows up, is initially skeptical, but after he overhears a rather incriminating conversation between Ankit and a woman named Prachi, is convinced that the four may be terrorists and interrogates them. The four steadfastly deny their involvement in any terrorist activity - but must face up to the situation when a fifth suspect, a woman named Diana, claims that they belong to her group - which has already made plans to blow up the airport today.","popularity":0.3734,"poster_path":"/pE0SFeO09BuSFI9YpRHxU8tx1Wu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2011-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shakal Pe Mat Ja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umang Jain","original_name":"Umang Jain","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/embqZ9z8euq28pKXJJj5f70vX4H.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Prachi","credit_id":"52fe4ae0c3a36847f81e64ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aamna Shariff","original_name":"Aamna Shariff","popularity":0.1766,"profile_path":"/cFDUulkp2xiSzWq2bsSEJQrTnXt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Diana","credit_id":"52fe4ae0c3a36847f81e64af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saurabh Shukla","original_name":"Saurabh Shukla","popularity":0.7132,"profile_path":"/uFGVBmRIHLAQkYYSI2lSXOxMi4f.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vijay Dinanath Chauhan","credit_id":"5a53b0b70e0a26026303941b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raghubir Yadav","original_name":"Raghubir Yadav","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":"/khyp4vnuGKVxrtszyB7kSf3vuzw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Om Prakash","credit_id":"5a53b0c5c3a3687553036d02","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zakir Hussain","original_name":"Zakir Hussain","popularity":0.5769,"profile_path":"/etiL0ANjzBhTiyvUblZl6vwIog9.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Omama","credit_id":"5a53b0da0e0a260269038bd7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shubha Mudgal","original_name":"Shubha Mudgal","popularity":0.1816,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae0c3a36847f81e6495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050180,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarita Jalan","original_name":"Sarita Jalan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae0c3a36847f81e649b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2109200","wikidata_id":"Q16254091","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pE0SFeO09BuSFI9YpRHxU8tx1Wu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shakal Pe Mat Ja - Official Trailer - IPIX Movies","key":"OQlsQgcNMJs","published_at":"2011-08-12T09:49:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a53b1490e0a260275038e25"}]}}}
