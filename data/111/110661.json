Well, all, except train robber and escape artist extraordinaire, Harry Tracy. As the last survivor of the Wild Bunch, Tracy pulls off a series of profitable robberies before making his way west to Portland, Oregon, in search of Catherine Tuttle -- a judge's daughter who has captured his heart. But on the way, Tracy is betrayed, arrested, and imprisoned. However, no jail can hold him for long and after making his escape, Tracy becomes the target of the largest manhunt in the history of North America.","popularity":1.2448,"poster_path":"/tW7tCkfZPXO9AD5c74P1Z6nuOC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guardian Trust Company","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":11916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sid & Marty Krofft Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":72442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ronald Cohen Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Film Development Corporation","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":36555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Last of the Wild Bunch","title":"Harry Tracy, Desperado","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der letzte Desperado","type":"Video"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Harry Tracy: The Last of the Wild Bunch","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Dern","original_name":"Bruce Dern","popularity":1.7354,"profile_path":"/24aH1ahmFFImPiBA5N4NhemshH9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Harry Tracy","credit_id":"52fe4ae1c3a36847f81e67b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Shaver","original_name":"Helen Shaver","popularity":1.0266,"profile_path":"/4RcaswFfLR8D3bQBHVlxyBR0R0H.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Catherine Tuttle","credit_id":"52fe4ae1c3a36847f81e67bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael C.
