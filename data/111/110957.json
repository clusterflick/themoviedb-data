A determined and joyful fight, but sometimes also trying and perilous. It all began in 1971, when the government, through its Defense Minister Michel Debré, declared that the Larzac military camp must expand. Radical, the anger spreads like wildfire, the peasants mobilize and sign an oath: they will never give up their land. In the daily face to face with the army and the police, they will deploy treasures of imagination to make their voices heard. Soon hundreds of Larzac committees will be born throughout France... Ten years of resistance, collective intelligence and solidarity, which will carry them to victory.","popularity":0.4454,"poster_path":"/xGg1qRJIGQmuUB13h0QsY6c0vKL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":836,"logo_path":"/93zzVd8ijSExx6DhVI4Xqj8WmOJ.png","name":"Elzévir
