The film focuses on the connection between private capital and government in Israel and suggests that a system exists whereby the State of Israel sells its limited resources, cheaply, to a handful of wealthy families. The film shows this by specifically focusing on the business relationship between the political leadership in Israel and one of the wealthiest families in the Israeli economy – the Ofer family.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/m334WxTplhOWi2JvXwCO59PxKe1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2008-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The movie nobody wants you to see","title":"The Shakshuka Method","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"the shakshooka system","type":"documentary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"the shakshuka method","type":"documentary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"the shakshooka method","type":"documentary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"שיטת השקשוקה","type":"documentary"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Rosenthal","original_name":"Mickey Rosenthal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3b1d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049295,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ilan Abudi","original_name":"Ilan Abudi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3af5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049297,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martha Wieseltier","original_name":"Martha Wieseltier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3afb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sharon Carney ","original_name":"Sharon Carney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3b01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gili Dickerman","original_name":"Gili Dickerman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3b07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049295,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ilan Abudi","original_name":"Ilan Abudi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3b0d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049295,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ilan Abudi","original_name":"Ilan Abudi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3b13","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049301,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mickey Rosenthal","original_name":"Mickey Rosenthal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad3c3a36847f81e3b19","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/m334WxTplhOWi2JvXwCO59PxKe1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"What story cost popular Israeli TV journalist Mickey Rosenthal his job?","key":"5UICGLQfHOs","published_at":"2009-06-18T05:10:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e2c3a36854480087fa"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"שיטת השקשוקה","key":"goAh4y6aWE8","published_at":"2008-08-22T13:54:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e2c3a36854480087f9"}]}}}
