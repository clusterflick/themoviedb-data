One respite to Raouf's dreary life is a recent film assignment -- to shoot an autobiographical film about his childhood. While working on the script, Raouf recalls his childhood home life under the strictures instituted by his devoutly religious father. The polar opposite of Raouf's father was his uncle Mansour, a jolly, life-loving soul who introduced Raouf to cinema through his work as a wandering film projectionist, which angered and shocked his father to no end but proved to be the most pivotal development in the youngster's life. Through cinema, Raouf found his place in this world and came-of-age -- something he may have to revisit in his adult life if he wishes to salvage his marriage.","popularity":0.1959,"poster_path":"/sI7VD2RPPP2RVPAqxojUVUT3flS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2003-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Box","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Basler","original_name":"Marianne Basler","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/74bRbi3pfSAzkwpbWtS822LRoYU.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Lou","credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdellatif Kechiche","original_name":"Abdellatif Kechiche","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/3blJf1ragOzMXtiWbxQ9dc23enm.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Raouf as Adult","credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hichem Rostom","original_name":"Hichem Rostom","popularity":0.2027,"profile_path":"/jnzhq99KAe5EirZy3NKUcPB8lMd.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Mansour","credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotfi Bouchnak","original_name":"Lotfi Bouchnak","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Father","credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Medhi Rebii","original_name":"Medhi Rebii","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Raouf as Child","credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrna Maakaron","original_name":"Myrna Maakaron","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54f3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049868,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malik Bencheghib","original_name":"Malik Bencheghib","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hassine Soufi","original_name":"Hassine Soufi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54df","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ridha Behi","original_name":"Ridha Behi","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049869,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Bednarek","original_name":"Philippe Bednarek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4adbc3a36847f81e54d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321518","wikidata_id":"Q12220313","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wwrhxRqIxWCKP31apdqmvRx7c7S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sI7VD2RPPP2RVPAqxojUVUT3flS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
