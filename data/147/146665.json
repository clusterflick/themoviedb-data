From frame to frame……. this work offers a sense of film emulsion coming to life, and responding to the forces of light. In addition shifting camera positions, panning, tilting, using the zoom, framing and focusing are all part of the work. A sculpturing of a space from frame to frame on a surface where there is no space. The title, Wait  .... is asking the viewer to forgo our conditioned focus on the photographic image as a representation of a life situation, and instead, focus on the visual kinetic here and now. Physical therapy for the eyes, and delight for the senses.\"  – Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":"/cd3O61I4Z5yfUyrx0xtHVdf1pdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wait","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b8b9251416c751065ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0159824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cd3O61I4Z5yfUyrx0xtHVdf1pdn.jpg","vote_average":10,"vote_count":4,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x9btrrst2ix8KUT5MLrRWsEUMpN.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
