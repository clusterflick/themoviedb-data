The film follows the cast's fantastic journey to the place where it all began: Fort-Dauphin, in southern Madagascar.\r Two differents versions of a moment in African history: one related by the French officers back in the mid-17th century, and the other one by the Malagasy people. The characters tell their own vision of a common past. There was war of course but there were also love stories between those young French soldiers and beautiful Malagasy princesses. A fascinating voyage through Madagascar today, at the heart of its beliefs.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/uKBXWdW6ryd43eriNLNydrjtYel.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laterit Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":37535,"logo_path":"/vzNk435QC1zSA7DQHUV8v3QXygD.png","name":"Cobra Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":253592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre Vollard","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An enchanting movie for those who love opera, Madagascar, history, and music.","title":"An opera from indian ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurore Ugolin","original_name":"Aurore Ugolin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c751061f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Landy Ambriamboavonjy","original_name":"Landy Ambriamboavonjy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c751061fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karim Bouzra","original_name":"Karim Bouzra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c751061ff","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"César Paes","original_name":"César Paes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c751061ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Clémence Andriamonta-Paes","original_name":"Marie Clémence Andriamonta-Paes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c751061f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248302,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Luc Trulès","original_name":"Jean-Luc Trulès","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b04d36ddbc64cc91361d51","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Quentin Becognée","original_name":"Quentin Becognée","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b04d9f14263d4fe76c3f65","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Cristéa","original_name":"Frédéric Cristéa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b04dc6c465103e0435a680","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Mathé","original_name":"Gabriel Mathé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b04dd6f2e084af7f361e83","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Clémence Andriamonta-Paes","original_name":"Marie Clémence Andriamonta-Paes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b04f522a9e96da8d6c3d00","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"César Paes","original_name":"César Paes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b04f6747dbfba4646c4a78","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5Qm8BgmoqjGzQePFQdfA1ieNQw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uKBXWdW6ryd43eriNLNydrjtYel.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L'Opéra du bout du monde : lecture partition de percussions","key":"Z3heOwEwZQA","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2018-05-17T15:53:25.000Z","id":"67b04efaa524dd1d0a35a747"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"An Opera From The Indian Ocean (Trailer)","key":"7kiPxRpyPtg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-05-19T22:49:05.000Z","id":"67b04ef02a9e96da8d6c3ceb"}]}}}
