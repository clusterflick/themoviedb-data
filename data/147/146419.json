Sam, an aspiring screenwriter, and David, a successful magazine editor, have been pals for years. When David doesn't appreciate Sam's latest attempt, it opens a fissure in their friendship, one that spreads through the rest of their lives. Ultimately, both men must reevaluate their motivations to write, their need for praise and validation, and what it means to see yourself as you actually are.","popularity":0.675,"poster_path":"/ygKFopMuD2kcfZjq6A10DTW0ca7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Tooth Virgin","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin Peck","original_name":"Austin Peck","popularity":0.2034,"profile_path":"/9C3OpA74heU8VfK8kHOCkUFyEHD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"52fe4b809251416c75104ed1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryce Johnson","original_name":"Bryce Johnson","popularity":0.5452,"profile_path":"/iyHjMvKijZZDVZkK681JAio4nAh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David","credit_id":"52fe4b809251416c75104ed5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roma Maffia","original_name":"Roma Maffia","popularity":0.6339,"profile_path":"/oEfa2NUJJNo4zg74eB5oY86tyip.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Christopher","credit_id":"52fe4b809251416c75104ed9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Gilroy","original_name":"Tom Gilroy","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":"/bKzidtz01QqN49YdJE7fcyr8Ezm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Louis","credit_id":"52fe4b809251416c75104edd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Brown","original_name":"Russell Brown","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b809251416c75104ecd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1235058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ygKFopMuD2kcfZjq6A10DTW0ca7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"90714431","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2014-04-02T02:17:27.000Z","id":"67a4cc7b2f44f82ad32ff5ee"}]}}}
