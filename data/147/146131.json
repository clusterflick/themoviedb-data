Against a barren winter landscape, a figure approaches: it's a man, pulling a small sleigh on which another man sits, plucking a dead bird. They stop to trade places; the one now on the sleigh takes out his knitting. Accidents, misunderstandings, disagreements, and an outright fight await our absurd protagonists as their trip to nowhere continues, first with one pulling, then the other. What if they were to lose the sleigh? What rules of civilization and partnership would guide them then?","popularity":0.4093,"poster_path":"/mrNVoikbiZiItJvNbXsbuzrMIQN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1962-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mammals","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":41,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Mamíferos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henryk Kluba","original_name":"Henryk Kluba","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/5MVGXCzFl7mg9CVxwMMvHkEJIUL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Man in the snow","credit_id":"52fe4b749251416c751035af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michał Żołnierkiewicz","original_name":"Michał Żołnierkiewicz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/j37wODWV29cuiNjbuRp6GkqFU6e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Man in the snow","credit_id":"52fe4b749251416c751035b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Voytek Frykowski","original_name":"Voytek Frykowski","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/3AJ4Vp6JEsBjPKQeKGOsf8ncz9r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Man in the snow (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4b749251416c751035b7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Polanski","original_name":"Roman Polanski","popularity":1.4257,"profile_path":"/5Kks5RMO2az5YOcFJjYXiDt4qH1.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b749251416c751035ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Kondratiuk","original_name":"Andrzej Kondratiuk","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/iYm6qbEbovpQrLP99733EWslaRY.jpg","credit_id":"5960ddcbc3a3680d590923ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Polanski","original_name":"Roman Polanski","popularity":1.4257,"profile_path":"/5Kks5RMO2az5YOcFJjYXiDt4qH1.jpg","credit_id":"5960ddd192514179040232c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54077,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Janina Niedźwiecka","original_name":"Janina Niedźwiecka","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/c3JP7q4e1hndlbQc3otbLFpmOz6.jpg","credit_id":"5960dde99251410bfa0c0646","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7096,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Halina Prugar-Ketling","original_name":"Halina Prugar-Ketling","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/Aw8bijPfx2bSIP7mXZXWufi2n5i.jpg","credit_id":"5960ddf392514179040232e2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Kostenko","original_name":"Andrzej Kostenko","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/onIjyT3LtlOvOyzpxAhlt6wtBDh.jpg","credit_id":"5d6704d212c60400116f30df","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Komeda","original_name":"Krzysztof Komeda","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d670acf4539d000115407dd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0056521","wikidata_id":"Q2036485","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xr01nimylU61k4avp0QukvWghHQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/17YOrYLpT4PF8daBe82sFNFWnt9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mrNVoikbiZiItJvNbXsbuzrMIQN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3661,"name":"sleigh"},{"id":10794,"name":"snow"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":210710,"name":"absurdist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
