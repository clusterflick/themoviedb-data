The pieces of text which I've used are as follows: ‘the universally gladdening light … As inmost soul … it is breathed by stars … by stone … by suckling plant … multiform beast … and by (you). I turn aside to Holy Night … I seek to blend with ashes. Night opens in us … infinite eyes … blessed love.’” -SB","popularity":0.0622,"poster_path":"/44ZEsFbhiSfTLKGMw8uzOXnMg2m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From: First Hymn to the Night – Novalis","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"First Hymn to the Night – Novalis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b8b9251416c751065e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0280676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/44ZEsFbhiSfTLKGMw8uzOXnMg2m.jpg","vote_average":6.722,"vote_count":6,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cpKTXERXISKJVIMx3W6bDnrRmyr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":764},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bT06kAapIydF3K1P5b2GUt4dMjZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":764},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1932,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ab3ctWDQ954KQ0QttG59y1ryVmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1288}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
