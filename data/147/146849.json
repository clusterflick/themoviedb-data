Venturing beyond the frontiers of most mountain films, Solitaire is backcountry skiing forged in the tradition of Western cinema. Born in the spires of Argentina’s legendary Las Lenas, a lonely two-year journey begins through an abandoned world, wandering the length of a continent from Peru’s Cordillera Blanca to Chilean Patagonia. Lost in the winds of snowbound badlands and the blizzards of primordial forests; seen from a horse’s saddle and a paraglider’s wings; ridden on ski and board and telemark...Solitaire fuses western-inspired tales of backcountry gambles into landscapes never before visited on film.","popularity":0.1039,"poster_path":"/fcmthwcV3TBYnxlUdeqv3H4Wdla.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19469,"logo_path":"/9J7UPjnJ0AanK0BJLYKmikrVUS1.png","name":"Sweetgrass Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From these most inhospitable of lands, a handful of drifters emerge","title":"Solitaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JP Auclair","original_name":"JP Auclair","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/2fxJUdNAyEVOi0cA8Ac83hkuJeh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b929251416c75107425","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Waggoner","original_name":"Nick Waggoner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6b8b910e0a262452003cc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fcmthwcV3TBYnxlUdeqv3H4Wdla.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
