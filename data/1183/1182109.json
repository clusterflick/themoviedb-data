If you have the Blu-ray, you will have seen the Making of documentary which mainly focuses on the work we did in Sweden. This month’s IC release tells “the rest of the story” – the long journey from the initial idea to edit in March 2020 to November 2020, when the final mixes were signed off, and everything in between – which includes me catching Coronavirus!  The documentary is around 70 minutes long, and you’ll see me doing some of the lyric rewrites, adding overdubs and chopping and editing this thing!”","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transatlantic: The Making of Breath of Life (Abridged Version)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neal Morse","original_name":"Neal Morse","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/w9kHIOGQ307DFsIj99iP30TcmaF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650db688d34eb30100e4220a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Inner Circle Fan Club","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
