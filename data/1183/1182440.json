Mary tells him that her daughter has adopted a child, and they intend to baptize him. The priest, delighted, agrees to baptize the child until he discovers the sexual orientation of the child's mother: that she is a lesbian. From that moment on, the pastor will refuse to officiate the baptism and instead begins a discussion with his parishioner.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/nUIZDT7ZPAGrmj9SIKuUDeQE3Es.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hail Mary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4286594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Dolors Carvajal","original_name":"María Dolors Carvajal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"650edd27f29d6600ff3bb304","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4286595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josep Cambray Vila","original_name":"Josep Cambray Vila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"650edd3be8d0b4010ce2fb13","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4286593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc M Díaz","original_name":"Marc M Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650edcdb6f53e10aac2a44ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4286593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc M Díaz","original_name":"Marc M Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650edd6ba9117f00e191a6ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nUIZDT7ZPAGrmj9SIKuUDeQE3Es.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhPtkRoysdzddZSdm5nmpxaQ7MC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Tels Quels concours du court métrage LGBT+","release_date":"2023-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
