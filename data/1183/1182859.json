Dubbed \"The People's Poet\" by fellow poets, he won the Governor General's Literary Award in 1975. Burned out by personal crises, Acorn moved back to Charlottetown in 1981. This film, directed by a P.E.I. filmmaker, brings out Acorn's wit, love of nature, unorthodox political views, and sometimes infuriating personal contradictions.","popularity":0.1829,"poster_path":"/FZmKkikB3QnSVgw9QXqH27WAjT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Love and Anger: Milton Acorn - Poet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Acorn","original_name":"Milton Acorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65105814e8d0b400eb2faeae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Gobeil","original_name":"Charlotte Gobeil","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65105829e8d0b400adbcab99","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"65105846a9117f011b2099b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"65105853e8d0b4014e0e554b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"6510585e344a8e00ac1e7876","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846976,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Cowling","original_name":"Barry Cowling","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65105875344a8e00ac1e7883","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arthur McKay","original_name":"Arthur McKay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65105894344a8e00e2ad5669","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arthur McKay","original_name":"Arthur McKay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651058a56f53e10aa4c9ebc8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727741,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Les Halman","original_name":"Les Halman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651058b56f53e10aa7af2570","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2254436,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sean Whalen","original_name":"Sean Whalen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651058ce344a8e00e2ad5686","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3896217,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Tittle","original_name":"Steve Tittle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651058de3a4a1200c5aa4465","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068485,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kent Nason","original_name":"Kent Nason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fujgwp9srNvqZJn0FR9V7hkjrHo.jpg","credit_id":"67981c560a30d6d059242f51","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226815","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gs9IQ5Vg7UvldorPzBCvZ1shzGF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/FZmKkikB3QnSVgw9QXqH27WAjT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
