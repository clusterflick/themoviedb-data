Lucio is a very bright, calm, and cheerful person, always seeing the good in everything. Raven is his opposite. Not a single week goes by without some drama or another at their house. After a few unsuccessful suicide attempts, Raven has been prescribed daily medication to help him become more emotionally stable. The memory of being a highly successful and sought-after stage actor, as well as being loved by a very handsome and wealthy man who played such a supportive part in their relationship, is still very strong for Raven. As for Lucio, everything is going well; he has a good job which sometimes keeps him very busy, but it provides a generous and steady income for his relationship in which he plays such a significant role. However, when Raven turns 45, something will happen, something to explode their superficially maintained relationship. What will happen, and who will survive the blast?","popularity":0.101,"poster_path":"/y8ymddrVtjELgFZQXGW76BXkNW9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Azazel Against It","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Cantu","original_name":"Ernesto Cantu","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65104899e1faed00e3f629ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Major","original_name":"Bella Major","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6510489f26dac100eb1a3674","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4288350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Rivera","original_name":"Paulo Rivera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/aV0N5JuwwGGeUH5vrUG7if0p2Ie.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"651048ad6f53e10aa5d34367","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3053801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Tidy","original_name":"Edward Tidy","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"651048b46f53e10aa7af1ea1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Roy","original_name":"Oliver Roy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"651048d9344a8e00c59e9030","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Mackie","original_name":"Doug Mackie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"651048e1a3e4ba0138191f9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Everatt","original_name":"Tom Everatt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"651048f5e1faed00c616a0e6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3037479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Cathcart","original_name":"Gregory Cathcart","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"651048fea3e4ba00fe31c40a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciara Pouncett","original_name":"Ciara Pouncett","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65104906344a8e00ac1e7171","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lex Melony","original_name":"Lex Melony","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651047703a4a12011cf375f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12715246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5IjUOd6mXFm89x8VmsO6YbZYtcj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uatDbN8HoBsdGh2VRCVKZOFJWZT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y8ymddrVtjELgFZQXGW76BXkNW9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
