He discovers that the target’s daughter, Nonie Darwish now lives in Los Angeles and decides to write to her without telling her about his role in the case. Thus begins Geizi’s reexamination of the first targeted assassination that Israel conducted. As he reunites with his partners in the operation, he uncovers new and unsettling information and decides to take action – to reveal to Nonie all he knows about her father's death, hoping it will ease his troubled conscience.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":"/eZTiGMvtFXbXv66OGIfelYYArh4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Telling Nonie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"نوني، عيوني","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5189272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nonie Darwish","original_name":"Nonie Darwish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"678cab335add61273d651539","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uriel Sinai","original_name":"Uriel Sinai","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65101b7526dac1010c757d58","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paz Schwartz","original_name":"Paz Schwartz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65101b64e8d0b400eb2f91d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uriel Sinai","original_name":"Uriel Sinai","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65101bbde8d0b400adbc8e40","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paz Schwartz","original_name":"Paz Schwartz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65101ba56f53e10aa5d32dfb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4030123,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Inbal Levi","original_name":"Inbal Levi","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65103d06e8d0b4014e0e49bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noa Lahav","original_name":"Noa Lahav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65103dbc3a4a120139561140","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288269,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tamara Maimon","original_name":"Tamara Maimon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65103c26a3e4ba00c495b6c8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4030118,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Orly Atlas-Katz","original_name":"Orly Atlas-Katz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/kE2rz1jrDIsnYBJ2To5NKXpZ4A6.jpg","credit_id":"65103c456f53e10aa7af19c1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sagi Bornstein","original_name":"Sagi Bornstein","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65103c03a3e4ba00c495b6a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288287,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Omri Kronland","original_name":"Omri Kronland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65103df726dac100eb1a321b","department":"Production","job":"Development Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Osnat Saraga","original_name":"Osnat Saraga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65103cc0a3e4ba00c495b730","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jdhd8fX4M1i7llF26hFWjIj39Dd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yxisaHSE2l6avp9XH6lAlTJDQoB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1680,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eZTiGMvtFXbXv66OGIfelYYArh4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rPxFPY3zkn6vkJlkq8FvhLRhA8Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1829}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
