The narrative is interwoven with axioms from Heraclitus and accompanies a series of images of instruments of measurement and representation of light and time, and others including the melting of a glacier and the incorrupt body of St Bernadette of Lourdes. The title is a direct reference to Lucretius Latin poem De Rerum Natura: on the nature of things.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Short Study on the Nature of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4284910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Montaron","original_name":"Laurent Montaron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650d7fc644ea54013b7fa5ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
