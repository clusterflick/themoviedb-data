The British artist invites the observer to take a visual stroll through his paintings and explore the dimensions of time and space. In communicating a new sense of the spacetime continuum, he injects the medium of photography with entirely new and living components. His sensuous theatre sets make us hear music with our eyes and see colours with our ears. The documentary filmmaker Gero von Böhm paints a memorable portrait of a fascinating artist, whose work allows all of us to see the magic in the small and seemingly insignificant details of everyday life.","popularity":0.1763,"poster_path":"/9b3qFW1XhuzRpptg1t1fJD9ePME.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Hockney: Pleasures of the Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Hurd-Wood","original_name":"Philip Hurd-Wood","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"651067cf3a4a1200ff4f046f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gero von Boehm","original_name":"Gero von Boehm","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651067f5a3e4ba00c495cb0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29281234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9b3qFW1XhuzRpptg1t1fJD9ePME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
