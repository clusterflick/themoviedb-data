This is the story of a man who spoke out as a progressive voice in the Anglican Church, a polarizing force at the University of Oxford, and as a tireless campaigner for animal rights, on a range of issues from fox hunting and seal clubbing, to vivisection. Today, Andrew considers himself a failure. But despite the immense price he has paid for confronting the cruelty of animal exploitation, Andrew has also had an enormous and, until now, largely unheralded impact on the modern animal movement.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/NkgvX0NFsYz7oKA0NcoSe6OEpD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The life and struggles of controversial animal rights pioneer and maverick theologian Andrew Linzey.","title":"The Animal Thing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4284987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Linzey","original_name":"Adam Linzey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650d8e94d34eb300e371e52c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/NkgvX0NFsYz7oKA0NcoSe6OEpD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
