It imagines a genetically advanced future humanoid who’s evolved to be a ‘natural born smoker’ – complete with enlarged nostrils and tapping finger - before reminding us that no such creature yet exists. While we expect smoking adverts to be disturbing, the titular character is disquieting in a refreshingly unusual sense.","popularity":0.4511,"poster_path":"/utGU2zFm8VE9zuicAcbkdTQzntn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spots Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smoker of the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Natural Born Smoker","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Myers","original_name":"Barry Myers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f0fbee1faed013a0a7802","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/utGU2zFm8VE9zuicAcbkdTQzntn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQA1agw3wKOhOLgvlWdvOFrPlq5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":311,"name":"human evolution"},{"id":4565,"name":"dystopia"},{"id":212516,"name":"dark future"},{"id":236189,"name":"future noir"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":319579,"name":"public information film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
