Lewie has lived all his life in the fishing village of Sambro, Nova Scotia.  The unlikely patriarch of a multi-million-dollar fishing dynasty, he's a man who tackles it all--fair weather or foul--with compassion, pragmatism, infectious humour and a healthy sense of life's absurdities. One Man's Paradise mixes sea-going adventure, humour and great humanity to tell the story of this extraordinary 'ordinary' man who has spent most of his life hunting the largest fish in the sea. The North Atlantic Ocean is harsh and unforgiving--not most peoples' idea of paradise. But seen through Lewie's eyes, it becomes a magical place where we catch a glimpse of what makes life worth living ... not just for him, but for all of us.","popularity":0.1296,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":209320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brett Films (Halifax)","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Man's Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Brett","original_name":"John Brett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f092ae8d0b400adbbff0b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Brett","original_name":"John Brett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f093ba3e4ba00c494feaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135591,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steven Naylor","original_name":"Steven Naylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f095ee1faed0100e856b8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Brett","original_name":"John Brett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f0919a3e4ba00c494fea0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Brett","original_name":"John Brett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f090be8d0b4014e0db14e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1098069,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allan Scarth","original_name":"Allan Scarth","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f0972f29d6600ff3bc447","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"650f094aa3e4ba00e1773eb8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
