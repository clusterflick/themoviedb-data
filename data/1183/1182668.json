Inspired by Rudolf Steiner, Dr. Jenny's penetrating observations of distinct types of patterns in nature led to these dramatic experiments animating inert substances with audible sound. This film focuses on the polarities of seemingly static structures which are actually dynamic flowing forms. A stunning array of images evolves before your eyes, as audible sound excites inert piles of lycopodium dust and kaolin paste into processes which mimic atomic, geologic, biological, solar and even galactic shapes and movements.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/mi0cRHJ8DFi1fE8ZiEHiw6NM3oq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209357,"logo_path":null,"name":"MACROmedia Publishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A visually exciting and fascinating portrayal of the interplay of vibration and form, energy and matter.","title":"Cymatic Soundscapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Volk","original_name":"Jeff Volk","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f8c8026dac1012d5accdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mi0cRHJ8DFi1fE8ZiEHiw6NM3oq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
