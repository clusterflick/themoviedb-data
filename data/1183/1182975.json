After they are caught playing with tarot cards by the nuns, Eden comes up with a plan to retrieve them from the chapel but Grace is hesitant. Through flashbacks of Grace's memories, the reason for their strained relationship is slowly revealed. Grace eventually reluctantly agrees to Eden's plan, but once they are in the chapel, she backs out â€” which starts a long overdue argument between the two of them.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vigil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2631098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avery Reyes","original_name":"Avery Reyes","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510938a3a4a1200ad9a0475","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Short Circuit 7","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
