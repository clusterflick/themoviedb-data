Bonhoeffer was a German Lutheran pastor, theologian and anti-Nazi dissident who was a key founding member of the Confessing Church movement. Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to the Nazi dictatorship, including vocal opposition to Hitler's genocidal persecution of the Jews. He was arrested in April 1943 by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Tegel prison for one and a half years. Later, he was transferred to Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. Bonhoeffer was accused of being associated with the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and was then quickly tried along with other accused plotters, including former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office). He was hanged on 9 April 1945, four weeks before the surrender of the Third Reich.","popularity":0.2001,"poster_path":"/b9SQAIGEcWcjOomh2vSS3QMt5M3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Puritan Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonhoeffer vs. The Third Reich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305183,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryan Holland (VI)","original_name":"Ryan Holland (VI)","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/o8Mu0mUrErrbZr2n4X1W0WncGS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer","credit_id":"651d7d7274507d00ac474d8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Attwood","original_name":"Zach Attwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eArYFl8193IqMSvqEnuvfkkhR2d.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ernst Tillich","credit_id":"651d7ecb967cc73425f25d99","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4305196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Bogdanec","original_name":"Carol Bogdanec","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Paula Bonhoeffer","credit_id":"651d825ac50ad2012c1b48cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bethany Brandt","original_name":"Bethany Brandt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oOWu0gJT9fMlNyuBiPDxUHxAlAQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Inge Karding","credit_id":"651d8432ea84c700aeebf64b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taye Cannon","original_name":"Taye Cannon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/jpXMKhMC4syNqL0l6XADRfQJxDI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Eberhard Bethge","credit_id":"651d85508c22c0012054bcaf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2994963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay E.
