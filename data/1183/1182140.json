They use diverse technologies to monitor their lands, and when necessary, force out illegal operations and actors. Most of this daily work, which involves lengthy hikes and patient observation, goes unseen.  This film depicts the process of the Indigenous Guard: its patrols, its watchful vigilance over the landscape, and its support of the community. Their work as guards helps ensure that destruction in the Amazon doesn’t advance, and that their community has the vital space it needs to live life on their own terms.","popularity":0.4919,"poster_path":"/z6d8cKZpAeCIjjAtS4LlAUb49pK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazon
