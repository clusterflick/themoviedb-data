It's been three years since the latter left for the USA and since then, he has severed ties with his family since he does not write and he does not call either. The young man is disturbed and he never stops wondering what happened to his father in this American adventure. Sometimes he wonders if his father hasn't forgotten him. But what hurts him most of all is that all the young people in the neighborhood are tempted, like his father, by an adventure in the USA, the country that took his father away from him.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Que mon père revienne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drissa Toure","original_name":"Drissa Toure","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650fb11109c24c00ad4e90ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29182208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
