As a cinematographer, he does not strive for personal style. Instead, he concentrates on fulfilling the potential of the film and realizing his director’s designs. He is a consummate team player. This documentary features interviews with Wong and five directors with whom he has worked – Patrick Tam, Ann Hui, Tony Au, Lee Chi-ngai and Shu Kei, tracing the paths on which they have travelled together.","popularity":0.2469,"poster_path":"/hImHhsdGhqg5MUMyb34RoCr4uWB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2010-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscape On the Other Side: Hong Kong Cinematographer Bill Wong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Wong Chung-Piu","original_name":"Bill Wong Chung-Piu","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/1Mbv42Rd8cfFWRkDPmIpTZukMos.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650ded8dd34eb3011dcbd274","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tam","original_name":"Patrick Tam Kar-Ming","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/7QdaxdLfd9jeuIHXXSDdAocqkyK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650dedc2f9253200c94a8eea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Hui","original_name":"Ann Hui","popularity":0.3997,"profile_path":"/3HPHP8G9QZOtYgDwo9zqCqJmZUl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650dedca93db9200fe6b95da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Au Ting-Ping","original_name":"Tony Au Ting-Ping","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/xh07Jzx3k0mJWEUhRz39vyFFEK0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650dedee4da3d4012cc18151","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554389,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Chi-Ngai","original_name":"李志毅","popularity":0.2093,"profile_path":"/gGQVr5Q2FJrDWjUdm2yzlfGsIPX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650dee09b5bc2100c9eb3d38","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554842,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shu Kei","original_name":"Shu Kei","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":"/8nYkhr7cELR6waMoGAyR5dInozS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650dee164da3d4012cc1815e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554842,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shu Kei","original_name":"Shu Kei","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":"/8nYkhr7cELR6waMoGAyR5dInozS.jpg","credit_id":"650deeaa3d745400ac9d44d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3263916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ying Wai Chan","original_name":"Ying Wai Chan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650deea04da3d4014d56bd83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hImHhsdGhqg5MUMyb34RoCr4uWB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
