The electoral victory of politician Giorgia Meloni of the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia party, whose flag bears the flame symbol in honor of Benito Mussolini, and her post-fascist government have given them a boost. A hundred years after the Duce seized power, the word fascist is becoming socially acceptable again. Among many young people in Italy, being far right is considered cool. The identitarian movement \"Fortress Europe\" attracts them in droves. Fascism nostalgists make pilgrimages to Mussolini's tomb and hold rallies. Right-wing rock concerts but also intellectual \"meetings for tradition and identity\" form the ideology. A constant support is the ultra-fan scene of the football clubs. The documentary illuminates the facets of neo-fascism in Italy, lets activists have their say, but also a journalist who has been writing about the neo-fascist scene for 20 years.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/5NuI7tfZ95Ohdnvxju0v6pvHlXF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89110,"logo_path":"/qLFHtDLgfkclvTtzXKu5sPHNywr.png","name":"ECO Media","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neo-fascism in Italy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Schwarzhemden im Aufwind - Wie Neofaschisten Italien infiltrieren","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Néofascistes italiens - L'extrême droite a le vent en poupe","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Sguardi sulla società - Neofascisti d'Italia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Neofaszyści we Włoszech","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Neofascismo en Italia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Arte Re: Italiens neue Faschisten - Mussolinis Erben im Aufwind","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Arte Regards: Néofascistes italiens","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Fiore","original_name":"Roberto Fiore","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"644059a5e24b9302fb9f4df7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuele Tesauro","original_name":"Emanuele Tesauro","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"644059b8180dea04fb2ac213","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Castellini","original_name":"Luca Castellini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"644059cdd7cd0604e6da87b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desideria Raggi","original_name":"Desideria Raggi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"644059e1d7cd060510da878c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Berizzi","original_name":"Paolo Berizzi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"64405a20e24b9304dd9f4e60","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1896655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carmen Butta","original_name":"Carmen Butta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6440588f04863802fb116294","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1896655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carmen Butta","original_name":"Carmen Butta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6440589e5c32470524e84ea9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Ehrmann","original_name":"Martin Ehrmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644058c1d768fe05598f8945","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999205,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piero Passano","original_name":"Piero Passano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644058d4e24b9305319f4dd5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019241,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucio D.
