The directors Park Chan-wook (Oldboy), Kim Jee-won (A Bittersweet Life), Bong Joon –ho (Memories of Murder), Ryoo Seung-wan (Crying Fist) and Kim Ki-duk (The Isle) subvert the codes of genre cinema, just as their American predecessors did in the 1970s. In violently evoking the atmosphere of political and cultural decay in a wounded, divided Korea, these young filmmakers experiment with new cinematographic and narrative forms which have begun to take the world by storm.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angry Young Men of Korean Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Montmayeur","original_name":"Yves Montmayeur","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644005eddd4716080d8142bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1073531","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
