She's frustrated, ranting about how her dad lets her do whatever she wants at his house. Bestfriends Dee Williams and India Summer are spending a bit of time catching up together. They're both a bit upset because it's Mother's Day and it seems as though their step-daughters, Scarlett Sage and Gia Derza, have forgotten all about it. The two girls both feel guilty but promise the mothers that they weren't forgotten. In fact, the girls just got back from picking up their gifts at the mall. Serene Siren is frustrated to learn that her stepdaughter Lily Larimar still hasn't cleaned her room like she asked her to. When Lily leaves, Serene tries to find ways to motivate her somewhat lazy stepdaughter, but something comes up on her phone that piques her interest.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9zOGGfndz5KKDkOJHhwlEBVTvBA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53532,"logo_path":"/1s5JV8QAG5zEkkHnGFiyZB9Kusi.png","name":"Girlsway Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Be Mad Mommy","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1564800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Phillips","original_name":"Lauren Phillips","popularity":24.588,"profile_path":"/2Ew2MJpszw7aUXqLmY2ztqYN4q4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd493dd4716075a812bb9","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2280685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luna Lain","original_name":"Luna Lain","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/uut16rUHE2hIx3WtzdhI6gK9qqS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd4e937b3a9046f43186f","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":150130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"India Summer","original_name":"India Summer","popularity":55.95,"profile_path":"/fsGgLRyMWL5M2pNrlQi0wVxrdMx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd49d7e403d04dc2591cc","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1947509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Williams","original_name":"Dee Williams","popularity":9.424,"profile_path":"/rACD3htvc2HZSquKCf2gvgnGQdY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd4a137b3a9046f43184b","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2066288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Derza","original_name":"Gia Derza","popularity":12.152,"profile_path":"/hSrFY88Oy1QP2GQdBOxaeJlLqwl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd4a9b0ba7e05271323a1","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2770761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Larimar","original_name":"Lily Larimar","popularity":9.129,"profile_path":"/lK9K3SuqoaPc6C4eMRsUaO7zUP5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd4c237b3a904ed431756","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2021830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serene Siren","original_name":"Serene Siren","popularity":9.806,"profile_path":"/QKHFazeLnHrjACj63UMCHRtnAM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"643fd4ceeb093202fb1e41eb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1252079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Calvert","original_name":"Casey Calvert","popularity":21.227,"profile_path":"/wwVjVX2Wer35rOVqC9L5cG1HJ3m.jpg","credit_id":"643fd47695665804b401e9a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1647480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bree Mills","original_name":"Bree Mills","popularity":2.24,"profile_path":"/ql5DBazbVozMqktpcFv7aby2I0F.jpg","credit_id":"643fd4db37b3a904454318e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":99141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Angel","original_name":"Joanna Angel","popularity":4.258,"profile_path":"/netbgjlyv2k290BbRjUpUDChtFy.jpg","credit_id":"643fd47db0ba7e04cf1326c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":236031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Cross","original_name":"Eli Cross","popularity":7.108,"profile_path":"/gvcuYeRMltvRa4mnxTbxkwBJPXq.jpg","credit_id":"643fd485b0ba7e02fc1324bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9zOGGfndz5KKDkOJHhwlEBVTvBA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
