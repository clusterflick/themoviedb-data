Celia defiantly shattered the conventions of gender, sexuality and moral code. The legacy of one of the greatest Yiddish poets has been buried by time and repression obscuring one central fact. Celia’s work expands not only what it means to be a sexual being and Jewish but to be utterly, shamelessly human.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/z9B3c0TykCNOfNumCnAnBrcjzij.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Off the Page","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z9B3c0TykCNOfNumCnAnBrcjzij.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
