The songs offer a fascinating glimpse into the history of Helsinki’s Jewish community. The repertoire includes operetta songs, ballads and couplets that portray Jewish life in a humorous way, including good times and bad.  Most of Weinstein’s songs were originally performed as part of Yiddish-language revues and musical plays in the 1920s and ‘30s, but songs from World War II to the early ‘60s are also included. Weinstein wrote his lyrics to popular tunes of the day as well as folk songs and klezmer melodies. New melodies have been written for some of the songs.  The musical director of the Helsinki Yiddish Cabaret concert is New York clarinettist Michael Winograd, who also did the arrangements.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pmTnaQMlGak1xCUmWWefUrar3MG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Helsinki Yiddish Cabaret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4020654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Aho","original_name":"Susan Aho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64416261e2bca804b542ddcf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4020655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari Kaasinen ja","original_name":"Mari Kaasinen ja","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64416270b3f6f5055a9d7519","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4020656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karoliina Kantelinen","original_name":"Karoliina Kantelinen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6441627de2bca802fc42dcc0","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmTnaQMlGak1xCUmWWefUrar3MG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
