Ten years after the law opening marriage to same-sex couples, and in the run-up to the World Day against LGBTphobia on May 17, it demonstrates the persistence of homophobia in France. It also questions the way the police and the justice system respond to these attacks. The voice of the film is provided by Eddy de Pretto, a singer committed against homophobia.","popularity":0.4465,"poster_path":"/r9zlDVFk5Y5QFAXlqS0mVoxR0rM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160393,"logo_path":"/bp6oiezKSY1kI7YO9B5ZmOBgHip.png","name":"Mediapart","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guet-apens,
