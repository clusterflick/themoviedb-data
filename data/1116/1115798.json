Resembling Patrick Watson’s Witness to History in its dramatization of the past, filmmaker Paul Morrison goes one step further by creating a behind-the-scenes world around the show; and in doing so, he offers up a clever satire, as timely as ever, on the medium’s exploitation of two men who are united through art, but divided over politics. For this short piece, Morrison assembled a wonderful cast, featuring Henry Goodman (this year’s Love Gets a Room), Michael Pennington, Louise Jameson (Doctor Who) and Alison Steadman (Life is Sweet).","popularity":0.5856,"poster_path":"/vDU8q6Xo8CyZUMUGecLdsGKta3P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146057,"logo_path":null,"name":"APT Film and Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Degas and Pissario Fall Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Pennington","original_name":"Michael Pennington","popularity":0.3925,"profile_path":"/vNhw2KX9qaNJCYMNEwkSeo3EWMY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Degas","credit_id":"64415c1afcec2e0491d8f6c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Goodman","original_name":"Henry Goodman","popularity":0.35,"profile_path":"/5GTCMmzXa68PmitzuEyEpvjUUxO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pissario","credit_id":"64415c2ad35dea0481fa670e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Steadman","original_name":"Alison Steadman","popularity":0.8739,"profile_path":"/BY0jL3IrAx7TA2OlQhY03ISk9i.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Emma Dumay","credit_id":"64415c41d35dea04adfa6a6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":179598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Jameson","original_name":"Louise Jameson","popularity":0.3783,"profile_path":"/4nWpcbj3DHVJwkz8KXxSUvAlfji.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"64415c5ab3f6f504c89d75ce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Wingfield","original_name":"Peter Wingfield","popularity":0.5901,"profile_path":"/kxOVLdHbceSstDglgUvQdQKbt6n.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Phillip","credit_id":"64415c74e2bca8046142d9c8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Morrison","original_name":"Paul Morrison","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64415ca3d35dea0481fa6733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109591","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vDU8q6Xo8CyZUMUGecLdsGKta3P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
