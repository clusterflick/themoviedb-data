To their credit the people win however, the fall out is unprecedented. The American people have now been sent back to Great Depression like times( living out of boxes Ect.) . Without the government being the ruling authority of the land, Organized crime fills those shoes. However, this is not the only change, all of America has migrated towards one part of the country creating one mega city which the mob bosses call \"Quad city\". The city got its name because each mob boss has a designated area that they rule over. Our Story picks up in 2025 where we follow Billy Badass as he tries to make a better life for himself. Unfortunately the only way he can do so is if he kills the other 3 mob bosses and takes their districts. Will Billy succeed in making a better life for himself or will he die trying.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballad of Billy Badass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3791002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
