Hernando is a man in his forties who is determined to find his aunt Graciela, the only living relative whose testimony will allow him to inherit a substantial amount of money. On the contrary Alejandra, Hernando's wife, thinks that no money should justify the risk of putting themselves in the midts of a 'red zone'. Blinded by his ambition, Hernando convinces his wife to keep on with their money quest. Both the couple and the girl end up being captured by members of a local guerrilla. Finally, the gruesome Colombian conflict will decide their destinies in a totally unexpected way.","popularity":0.2571,"poster_path":"/3Kz6xwzm7uICHnu01G99cubw6bQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heridas","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlon Moreno","original_name":"Marlon Moreno","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/kDoq3qs9V8CU7xbVTrvO4kUac6t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67a6480e1f6b3834ff2fe06e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Herrera","original_name":"Jorge Herrera","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/gKZQnmOH8NEqDiUKM7qrW5HinuB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67a648251f6b3834ff2fe085","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcela Agudelo","original_name":"Marcela Agudelo","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/yLFgxNbFLC91ZB1BBGgpw4m7qaX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67a64835df336f38ab85f687","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3429195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Germán Rojas","original_name":"Germán Rojas","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67a648bebf36040c5d860006","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Camila Escolar","original_name":"María Camila Escolar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67a64bcdf196a73ae76720ca","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Flores Prieto","original_name":"Roberto Flores Prieto","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6484e937d2e9b6066d60e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Franco","original_name":"Carlos Franco","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a648e4c1e5ed8bfc85ecf0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073686,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Cruz","original_name":"Carlos Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a64924937d2e9b6066d676","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María del Pilar Jimenez","original_name":"María del Pilar Jimenez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a64b21937d2e9b6066d73b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5472844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1051,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Kz6xwzm7uICHnu01G99cubw6bQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":316069,"name":"conflicto armado interno"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
