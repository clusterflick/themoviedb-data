Risking their lives, these courageous women smuggled gun powder out the munitions factory where they worked, with the goal of blowing up the gas chambers. The diary of Anna Wajcblum, one of the saboteurs whose sister was publicly hanged after being caught, forms the basis for the film. After the war, Anna became a social worker in Ottawa. Her diary highlights the bonds of friendship established between these women under the most horrific circumstances.","popularity":0.0438,"poster_path":"/wExX1fHj2fBIyiuPWXfzuuVpnhQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189842,"logo_path":null,"name":"KAN: Israeli Public Broadcasting","origin_country":""},{"id":142456,"logo_path":"/15k89jK3G1IOj784ILS70XVYnfx.png","name":"Doc.Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sabotage","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noa Aharoni","original_name":"Noa Aharoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644175f9fcec2e0439d8fa77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noa Aharoni","original_name":"Noa Aharoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b499c1f8cf4734519fc759","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21477914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1758,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wExX1fHj2fBIyiuPWXfzuuVpnhQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
