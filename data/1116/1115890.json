Elefsina’s archeological sites don’t come close to being as hauntingly beautiful as these dead ships. They stand majestically like memorial sculptures and bring a magnetism to the eye. In fact, these are the neglected refugees of Elefsina. For how did they end up there, anyway? What's their story? That's the story I want to know. Elefsina Notre Amour is a short sci-fi essay, a timeless archive, filmed on 16mm color Kodak.","popularity":0.3573,"poster_path":"/quLDt8PAYWnDJjsxKj5NGOSXvct.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elefsina Notre Amour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mahdi Fleifel","original_name":"Mahdi Fleifel","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":"/8EmgMMM0NuJT2dyIdlTchXQ7tnc.jpg","credit_id":"64417e38fcec2e0491d903af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1185,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/quLDt8PAYWnDJjsxKj5NGOSXvct.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
