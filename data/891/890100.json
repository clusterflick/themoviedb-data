State of Emergency wants to recreate this strange video-game reality. The film is an attempt to save a place in time: to describe it, and to remember it. Our current present — our own state of emergency, the Covid-19 pandemic — began more than a year ago, and no one knows how long it will last. The main markers of this new reality are isolation and distance. In the film, we see a virtual city has become like time itself, a labyrinth that is endless and uncertain. Meanwhile, lines from a diary collect the disparate thoughts accumulated over the course of a month.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":163267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chai Khana","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of emergency","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Detu Jintcharadze","original_name":"Detu Jintcharadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177cb1bb458b800932f5bb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariam Natroshvili","original_name":"Mariam Natroshvili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177cb0fe9da69002b9c945f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
