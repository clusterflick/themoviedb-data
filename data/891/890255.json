The television images, often recognizable from modern film classics, have been cut loose by him from the actual sequence of the original story and placed in a new, personal sequence. As a result, the storyline does not dominate (which in narrative films often gives the images their meaning/function), but the images stand more on their own as if they are treated as lemmas one by one. Details and film symbolism of the sampled images have been brought to the fore by stretching the time and reversing the sequences of the images. Despite the fact that each chapter 'written' by Breder has a clear beginning and end, a meaning is generated that stands on its own and lies outside a story or anecdote. The tension is heightened by repetitions, the complex structures in which the original is incorporated and the compelling soundtrack composed of film scores.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hJTNY2zy6WDpPiXgPwFtjdUKMuP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My TV Dictionary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Breder","original_name":"Hans Breder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gKKpdmu41VnDGnc9Hv61AQFzxyQ.jpg","credit_id":"61784c1df85958008e5827c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hJTNY2zy6WDpPiXgPwFtjdUKMuP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
