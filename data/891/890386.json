The surrounding air is dusty and smells of books. The sound of Philip Glass fills the headphones. His thoughts are floating around. He is thinking of the fabric of reality. What is the world made of? What was the beginning? Is it the mythological reality of Genesis on the first day of creation, or a second after the Big Bang? Stories of the world coming into being often start with mentions of light, with calling upon light – moving away from the void and from the past and getting ready to awakening and transformation. He is fantasizing about light and lightness. It is about origins of the beginning and the beginning of each day, about sun rays as pets.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clerk in The Meadow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabīne Šnē","original_name":"Sabīne Šnē","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6178c83ab458b8006a14eb04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
