Entertainment is evolving and so is the society we live in. Our taste in movies and TV shows reflects our current state of mind on a global scale. Why are vampires and witches such an enormous trend? This documentary explores an ever-growing hysteria focusing on the supernatural. This film features interviews with occultic experts, as well as high-ranking witches, druids and an interview with a former vampire. Former occultists share their testimonies, responding to the lure of Wicca by describing the devastating bondage in their own lives. They conclude with deliverance through the life-changing authority of the one True God. They compare the deceptive experiences in the occult with the Peace and Joy found in Jesus the Messiah, a showcase of His mercy and incomparable power.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3E0zt7dkl83JTpCRzIL45juFFcQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pop Culture Paganism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1096,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3E0zt7dkl83JTpCRzIL45juFFcQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":775}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
