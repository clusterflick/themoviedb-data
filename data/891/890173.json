Bennett and C. Mehrl (\"Lady C\") Bennett's courtship through mail-art in the late 1970's and early 1980s. Shot on 16mm film by John McClintock, the film is both a document of the DADA / Fluxus related underground mail-art movement of the period and a unique testament to the power of \"true love\".  The film features interviews with both artists as well as their Columbus, OH post-man, reenactments of collaborative poems by the couple, examples of their mail-art and footage from their July 4th, 1980 wedding in rural Mount Vernon, Ohio.  -John Also Bennett, December 2012","popularity":0.0559,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mail Art Romance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1858480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John M.
