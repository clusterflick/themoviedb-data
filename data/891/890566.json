The man is being interviewed by another man, with both roles played by the artist, Kuba Dorabialski. The interview is conducted in a fictional Pan-Slavic language devised from an ‘irrational’ mix of Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Serbo-Croat and Bulgarian. The conversation of the two men starts formally, but quickly devolves into a rumination on social responsibility, sincerity, and the limits of language. It ends in an ecstatic pseudo-mystical dance and an introduction to a pair of angels: representatives of 1917 and 1991; bookends of the Eastern European 20th century socialist project.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invocation Trilogy 1: Floor Dance of Lenin’s Resurrection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuba Dorabialski","original_name":"Kuba Dorabialski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61793348f859580043534be9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
