Today, many of these ancient traditions survive only in the mountains, where music and dancing still accompany people in joy and sorrow, just as they did a thousand years ago. After hearing a recording of a Tajik instrument called the maddoh many years ago, British musician Leo Abrahams was struck by its unusual beauty, and travelled to Tajikistan in an attempt to hear the music in person. In Rhythms of Lost Time, Leo travels the country and meets local residents, who introduce him to the hospitable and rich culture of Tajikistan. Together, they draw back the curtain on the challenges that traditional culture and the Tajik people have faced both in the past, and in the present day.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/ccLuFIKogFRFkZRObrpRY9YtLQ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TJ","name":"Tajikistan"}],"release_date":"2021-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tajik","iso_639_1":"tg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey through the most remote parts of Tajikistan - a young and little-known country which cradles the last embers of an ancient culture.","title":"Rhythms of Lost Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1539230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Abrahams","original_name":"Leo Abrahams","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6177d09d5294e700650c65b7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1849018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anisa Sabiri","original_name":"Anisa Sabiri","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/3I7pXN6wJUzHHsO9jpvkPfMQHmy.jpg","credit_id":"6177cff8e9da69008f88c8d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1849018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anisa Sabiri","original_name":"Anisa Sabiri","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/3I7pXN6wJUzHHsO9jpvkPfMQHmy.jpg","credit_id":"6177d07df2cf2500438331ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727812,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Smita Proto","original_name":"Smita Proto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177d01e71f09500291046d9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1998182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexey Venzos","original_name":"Alexey Venzos","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/xdzwlxfKcmD3PxI8XsJ9MNNDaXt.jpg","credit_id":"6177d05e5294e7002a4240d9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2227144,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Razvan Barseti","original_name":"Razvan Barseti","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177d02acf4b8b00623caaf3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ismail Nauzari-Zibai","original_name":"Ismail Nauzari-Zibai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177d007c2b9df00622174e1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Proto","original_name":"Joseph Proto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177d0139ee0ef002cf16b09","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15036218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ccLuFIKogFRFkZRObrpRY9YtLQ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tg","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tg","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tg","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
