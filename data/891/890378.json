Told through personal biography, the film searches for lost and split identity, using collective and personal archive materials and recent visits to Abkhazia; Finding abandoned summer house after 25 years in unrecognised territory offers a new perspective on roots. The house turns out to be a trap and a revelation; a “rite of passage” that opens the door to revisit the past.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Dziapshipa","original_name":"Anna Dziapshipa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6178c428a579f90090b8b748","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
