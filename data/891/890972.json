The work is part of an ongoing project addressing the intersectionality of responses to female characters in video games; formally speaking, the work is presented as an audio-visual poem, accompanied by voice over. According to Janković, this work is meant as a response to found footage material of the character Christie from the popular ﬁghting game series \"Dead or Alive\" (1996 – ongoing). Moreover, the examination of the role of female characters in \"Outsourcing (My Desires to Avatars)\" is part of a larger project titled \"The identity quest series,\" in which the artist addresses a multiplicity of responses to female video game characters, following engagement in interviews with queer people within the gaming industry and exploring their own views on gender in game design.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/fF1sP2SUHoHvoI7vy5eNnwRi8g2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outsourcing (My Desires to Avatars)","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Deborah Findlater","original_name":"Deborah Findlater","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"617a7b2afdc4fa0087677768","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Janković","original_name":"Jamie Janković","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617a798db458b80030559fc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Deborah Findlater","original_name":"Deborah Findlater","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617a7b21a097dc0065f8f5f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Deborah Findlater","original_name":"Deborah Findlater","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617a7b42e323f3002596b6c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Janković","original_name":"Jamie Janković","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617a7b49678259002ab72d03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fF1sP2SUHoHvoI7vy5eNnwRi8g2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milan Machinima Festival","release_date":"2021-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
