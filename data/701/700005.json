Sweeney cultivates a sense of ceremony in the game, showing each player arriving from different directions, to convene together. Subtitles are only provided for a few minutes, introducing us to the group’s conversation in their shared language. Sweeney creates a strong sense of the communication and conviviality, at play beyond words, through this omission, intimate close-ups of hands, and personal items – cards, keys, a bottle of cologne, and the tactility of analogue film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zC1V0rGSCIWRxNuRUdopDJmqtBi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds of a Feather","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nora Sweeney","original_name":"Nora Sweeney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaef93b0b731600244014f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zC1V0rGSCIWRxNuRUdopDJmqtBi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy","release_date":"2020-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
