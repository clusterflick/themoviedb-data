It focuses on three interwoven stories about senior dogs.  Thereâ€™s Chaser, the smartest dog in the world.  Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary, a retirement home for dogs in Tennessee.  And famed photographer, Jane Sobel Klonsky, who has devoted much of her talents towards capturing the bond between elderly dogs and their owners.  Unlike most animal documentaries, our goal is to highlight the positive.  No abuse will be shown in SENIORS.  This film will celebrate senior dogs and many of the seniors who love them.  It will show how vibrant they are, and how much they can offer to the world.  This will be the animal welfare film everyone can watch, leaving viewers grinning from ear-to-ear, and showing how old dogs really can teach us new tricks.","popularity":0.1264,"poster_path":"/bPeBeojU2WgSv441KeCYOSiQtru.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An old dog can teach you new tricks!","title":"Seniors: A Dogumentary","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"5f3f43eb904f6d0037a1fe56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10941616","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.652,"height":1178,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bPeBeojU2WgSv441KeCYOSiQtru.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
