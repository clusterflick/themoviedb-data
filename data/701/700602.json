Lucas Belvaux (Triton) is a creature of the sea and does not know the use of his legs, while Ines De Medeiros (Syrène) has already been on land for some time and is starting to get used to the upright position. Lou Castel (Vent) comes from the air and in his wanderings comes across the group of Sirens and Sirens who have become terrestrial. He is a 15th century fresco painter who goes from place to place through the centuries for his work, destined not to die and to always ask.","popularity":0.1902,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1997-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorrisi asmatici: fiori del destino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Castel","original_name":"Lou Castel","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/nfSbW6awANxaRI769Bo2ZLDb22P.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vent","credit_id":"6626ee2ae54d5d0165ee2b88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Belvaux","original_name":"Lucas Belvaux","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/qwUz2r8RPRjWPwwvHIc9RN1t30V.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Triton","credit_id":"6626ee3f62f335014bd815e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inês de Medeiros","original_name":"Inês de Medeiros","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/2DW8dVS1j4VRDgoIJzglFKHKCFz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Syrène","credit_id":"6626ee5daf9590014a67889d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"5eb149798cfcc70025accc12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"5eb1499e00fb6b001ee9de84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
