Maratha emperor Shivaji. Major Subhanrao Malusare, a direct descendant of Shivaji’s legendary lieutenant Tanaji Malusare, continues a proud family tradition by winning the Victoria Cross as an Allied officer fighting against Italian fascists in WW2. When he dies, his wife Savitri (Uma) vows that their son will never join the army. However, during the India-China conflict (1962), when her son’s friend is killed, she enjoins her son to fight for the nation even though the boy’s death would mean the end of the ancient clan. The film updated the rousing sentimentalism associated with Shivaji historicals into the present via songs such as He bharatiyano aika balidan katha veeranchi.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/g82YUcMc2D1p7h30knWrzfqlXCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panchdeep Chitra","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shevatcha Malusara","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":630098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramesh Deo","original_name":"Ramesh Deo","popularity":0.209,"profile_path":"/vM54BWGGeVY4OA4bY0A5Px06yw5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb1dc1e0b7316001c42d595","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shrikant Moghe","original_name":"Shrikant Moghe","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb1dc448cfcc70020ad3fab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashok Kumar","original_name":"Ashok Kumar","popularity":0.4169,"profile_path":"/qgGxN6haBTelGteikmDrGFixadV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb1dc57f74f5f001e953d16","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chandrakant Gokhale","original_name":"Chandrakant Gokhale","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb1dc69edeb43001cca612d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sachin Pilgaonkar","original_name":"Sachin Pilgaonkar","popularity":0.7531,"profile_path":"/2zXmcePsbfwgxrzhuXne44rFPnv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb1dc78f74f5f001f952d54","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2626884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhu Apte","original_name":"Madhu Apte","popularity":0.2858,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb1dc848cfcc7001ead3dae","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4258338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sumati Gupte-Joglekar","original_name":"Sumati Gupte-Joglekar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd54bd6a222700e0f0c45f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4260330,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Madhusudhan Kalelkar","original_name":"Madhusudhan Kalelkar","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd54d5db4ed610363d9d65","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4258336,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bal Joglekar","original_name":"Bal Joglekar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd54e62dffd800adb628ca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4259988,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Madhukar Deshpande","original_name":"Madhukar Deshpande","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd54fcefea7a011ab6943c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694764,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bal Korde","original_name":"Bal Korde","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd5570db4ed6104307bec3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832599,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"D.N.
