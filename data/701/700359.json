After studying art history under Rudolf Wittkower and Meyer Schapiro at Columbia University, Judd launched his career as a painter but was soon drawn to creating three dimensional structures. Made with common materials such as plywood, metal and Plexiglass, Judd’s sculptures confront the ideas of space, object and tangible art. Judd discusses his projects, intentions and future plans in his SoHo studio and later, his Marfa home.\r 1972 / 33 min. / color\r Directed by Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gY7UJx23ZrRH4bFCqd4r6EaFcNC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Artist's Studio: Donald Judd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gY7UJx23ZrRH4bFCqd4r6EaFcNC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
