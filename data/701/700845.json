Many died of drowning or starvation and thirst. Others were lost at sea, or robbed and killed by pirates. More than 30 years later, no major film or television program has told their stories. Bolinao 52 presents this long-silenced voice, an unspoken legacy of the Vietnam War. Filmmaker Duc Nguyen, also a boat refugee, retraces the odyssey of Bolinao 52 – a vessel adrift on the sea for 37 days—and a survivor Tung Trinh as she returns to her past to tell her story.","popularity":0.1108,"poster_path":"/o8LCB2ooiHqVKqDNssxJM7IHRjH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133355,"logo_path":null,"name":"KTEH","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":76564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Center for Asian American Media Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolinao 52","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duc Nguyen","original_name":"Duc Nguyen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb20fadf74f5f001d956a9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duc Nguyen","original_name":"Duc Nguyen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb20fc1bf0f63001f7fc183","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duc Nguyen","original_name":"Duc Nguyen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb20fe8f74f5f001f9561bb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627065,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"T.
