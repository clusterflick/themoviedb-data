Although briefly finding refuge in France, where he changed his name to Leo Maillet, his stay was cut short by Germany's invasion of Paris. Flucht traces Maillet's escape from the Gestapo and the French police, using Maillet's \"Entre chien et loup\" series of paintings as the framework for the film. Accompanied by Maillet's son Daniel, Peter Nestler revisits the late artist's hiding places and depicts a hauntingly beautiful portrait of an outstanding artist on the run.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/uk8XCzrUiSKpNt8HGVYEmXzU2al.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"5eb16c3ecaab6d0023daf036","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0370571","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uk8XCzrUiSKpNt8HGVYEmXzU2al.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
