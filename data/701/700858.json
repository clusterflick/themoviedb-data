Based upon the film footage of socialist Czechoslovakia a question is posited here regarding the further development of post-communist countries. The Communist Manifesto and the concepts of Karel Honzík, who in the early ’60s developed in his literary work the idea of a perfect communist society as the inevitable goal of cosmic matter, serve as a reflective bridge for considerations directed towards liberal capitalist societies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vgxR5dQWgEw7w7KG0ak5uctktbr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Socio-fiction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2618362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zbyněk Baladrán","original_name":"Zbyněk Baladrán","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb218caf74f5f001d957387","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vgxR5dQWgEw7w7KG0ak5uctktbr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
