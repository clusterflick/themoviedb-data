Recalling the tableu film-making of Peter Greenaway and the lyrical disjunction of Harold Pinter, The Animals Drums is one of the first significant British feature-length poetry-films of the 21st century. London disappears under the ground of the filmâ€™s ambiguous protagonist, who is half victim, half perpetrator. Gently mad, positively lost, we follow our host through the bounds of a changing, money-washed capital city.  Fusing documentary technique, montage and theatrical set pieces, the film features appearances from authors like Iain Sinclair and Stewart Home, alongside actors like Edie Deffebach and Lotje Sodderland, The Animal Drums is unique representation of modern London in old England.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/A9miNPueEpZFvUfGcIkAYCIZ2YR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Animal Drums","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2626847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven J.
