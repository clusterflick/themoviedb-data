Now declassified and open for public tours, the bunker was covertly maintained for 30 years in a state of readiness beneath the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Heath's video focuses on the eerie spaces of the vacant shelter and its remarkable blast doors which were engineered by the Mosler Vault Company whose bank vaults famously survived the atomic blast at Hiroshima.","popularity":0.3542,"poster_path":"/3empUd6VitX0KrBSZz0NDWtkIPF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There is Nothing Underneath the West Virginia Wing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Heath","original_name":"Frank Heath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb1ae715b2f47001e824e05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3empUd6VitX0KrBSZz0NDWtkIPF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1953,"name":"vault"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Simone Subal Gallery","release_date":"2018-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Screen Slate","release_date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
