Both images are processed through the Cox Box. The loop of the jumping boy had developed, over time, a network of miniscule cracks in the emulsion which were further emphasised by the increased contrast of the processing and the slow motion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zQpb1S6q8VLPf1PedIAWa5TcvIr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jumpcut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2617176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Andrews","original_name":"Ian Andrews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaf3e3ecdbaff001ab24d71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2617176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Andrews","original_name":"Ian Andrews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaf3e4fbf0f63001e7d1517","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQpb1S6q8VLPf1PedIAWa5TcvIr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
