According to all around them, their love is improper and inconvenient, as our heroes are past 70. Elsa is recently widowed and should be in mourning, even for the husband she never loved. But Elsa and Leonid not only do not hide their love, they’re also going to get married and go travelling to find their own land — Elsa’s Land. Their love story sounds particularly up-to-date as it refers to the elder audience who took the biggest hit of the global pandemic. It encourages them to live and love no matter what.","popularity":0.2656,"poster_path":"/qgO0A2KczO7VFrmP7hdwWmj1dZA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104513,"logo_path":"/y0yCNHomvkswL0q2cIiNrM6wmiC.png","name":"Sputnik Vostok
