A loose adaptation of Johann Wolfgang von Goethes epistolary novel 'The Sorrows of Young Werther', the opera is conducted by Germanys Cornelius Meister. It tells the story of the impossible union of poet Werther to Charlotte, a woman of duty already promised to a wealthy businessman. Goethes drama is echoed in Massenets score by emotionally wide-ranging vocal parts written on a grand scale. Juan Diego Flórez is undisputedly one of the best belcanto tenors of our times and embodies a tortured and nuanced Werther. 'Its not a profane appearance of any singer it is an epiphany!' gushes the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in a rave review. At Flórezs side, Franco-British mezzo-soprano Anna Stéphany sang her role début as Charlotte. The one-room staging by Tatjana Gürbaca cleverly makes the social stranglehold of oppression tangible.","popularity":0.1513,"poster_path":"/a7WcHoNmvqXceXm4oqwKWEkbeqU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Massenet: Werther","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":268115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Diego Flórez","original_name":"Juan Diego Flórez","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/5C27Cvb0Pvv1Nm8bmKy4T8SWzWI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Werther","credit_id":"5f5f4b6e688cd00038fc8036","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Stéphany","original_name":"Anna Stéphany","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"5f5f4b75fd7aa40039e898e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audun Iversen","original_name":"Audun Iversen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uCtJDK83nAqN4FL7jHG5VlrPBrW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"5f5f4b7cd8cc4a0039f25e78","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélissa Petit","original_name":"Mélissa Petit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5f5f4b84fd7aa40039e898f6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatjana Gürbaca","original_name":"Tatjana Gürbaca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f4b913123450036611536","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577319,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cornelius Meister","original_name":"Cornelius Meister","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717d2596fb09e394c02b174","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","original_name":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/sZcfT3pqAqibYjnYOjD841vXjEk.jpg","credit_id":"6717d3ab65418f2b86bed2d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926506,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Edouard Blau","original_name":"Edouard Blau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717d3cc65418f2b86bed2f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926508,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Milliet","original_name":"Paul Milliet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717d3e265418f2b86bed320","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926509,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Georges Hartmann","original_name":"Georges Hartmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717d3f56fb09e394c02b1ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jules Massenet","original_name":"Jules Massenet","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/fMB6VUi0gIcQEu3WBoP7G8rQMCD.jpg","credit_id":"6717d59ddcb7ff811e477cbe","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1384,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7WcHoNmvqXceXm4oqwKWEkbeqU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":923}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jules Massenet: Werther - with Juan Diego Flórez from the Opernhaus Zürich - on DVD & Blu-ray","key":"9HmUoevWhuU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-25T10:26:35.000Z","id":"6717d53a55ecf7a940f7a7b1"}]}}}
