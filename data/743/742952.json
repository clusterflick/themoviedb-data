In this experimental film, the difference between homemade video and official historical record is considered. Northern Indigenous women hunting is at the heart of this personal found footage film in which the filmmaker describes the enigmatic events that led to saving an important piece of family history from being lost forever.","popularity":0.2506,"poster_path":"/bzXOCU90LZy01io9d7FNkIz0AES.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regent Park Film
