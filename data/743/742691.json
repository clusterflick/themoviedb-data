Anna Artemyeva, a correspondent for Novaya Gazeta, spent a month at Yavlinsky's headquarters, accompanying him on his election trips. Much that the presidential candidate warned about then is coming true: the pension reform, the economic crisis, the change in the basic law, the irremovability of power ... In the 2018 elections, 77% of voters voted for Putin. For Yavlinsky - 1%. The film tells about the doomed attempt of a decent person to warn his country and fight for it in modern political realities.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Novaya Gazeta","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Artemyeva","original_name":"Анна Артемьева","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5JG9eAik4EJ6e7rlwVRYnUC9hq1.jpg","credit_id":"633eed7d90ea4b0091a97c04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2046325,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marina Makarova","original_name":"Marina Makarova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/imvQCo82KS14rlF3kUNNKwvZLi.jpg","credit_id":"5f5f5408312345003962dc90","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Sakharnov","original_name":"Kirill Sakharnov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lTGG3h2UQgTSYgmkxBKhCFKBUqr.jpg","credit_id":"5f5f53fd93388b00395ad611","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2777311,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Belyaev","original_name":"Vladimir Belyaev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f5417688cd00038fce847","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
