This film explores the transnational nature of governmental control over reproductive systems, and how this oppression manifests in our bodies and perceptions of self. I use the structure of my mother tongue, Korean, and my second language, English, to contemplate ruptures, repetition of time, and violence against women. An untold history resurfaces in the present, and re-orients us towards the future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7zxunlKV5tJoMCbOy8Uv4xLESQd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born, Unborn and Born Again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeon Kyu-ri","original_name":"Jeon Kyu-ri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f0184688cd0003af9e881","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7zxunlKV5tJoMCbOy8Uv4xLESQd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3rlfxHb1sGdDTkkoaiaL5npPCBU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Women's Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
