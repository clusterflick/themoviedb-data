The success was unmistakably due in great part to the presence of Erwin Schrott—already celebrated for his performance as a seductive, witty, and diabolical Mephistopheles in Gounod’s Faust. The masterfully subtle Charles Castronovo incarnates the disillusioned philosopher Faust, who makes a deal with the devil. Philipp Himmelmann’s staging combines simple elements (a stage curtain made of silvery filaments and a giant protean skull) to incredible effect to tell the story of Goethe’s Faust.","popularity":0.1217,"poster_path":"/mC3K50uE6Ryy8gaypH9dXr9xAOL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mefistofele","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Schrott","original_name":"Erwin Schrott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9UXpnvki0EHDGR5XtWWQvcgDra2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f7ede3f7e1d0036912d3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Castronovo","original_name":"Charles Castronovo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/kH3RqNqHPkwywWxysQLxw2Y3Vsb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f7ee63f7e1d0036912d48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Joy Blue","original_name":"Angel Joy Blue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f7eeefd7aa40039e97f62","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Penda","original_name":"Alex Penda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f7f038b959e0034b0134b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jana Kurucová","original_name":"Jana Kurucová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f7f0bbdc34c0039f562ae","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Himmelmann","original_name":"Philipp Himmelmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f7f193123450036619c45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428664,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan Soltesz","original_name":"Stefan Soltesz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f7f32156cc70036d9c004","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mC3K50uE6Ryy8gaypH9dXr9xAOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
