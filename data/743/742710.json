The economical use of a small instrumental ensemble over Latin vocal lines creates space for sublime surprises: more than abrupt mood changes or an unexpected fortissimo, we become attuned to the slightest dissonance, the delicate softness of instruments in unison, the briefest moments of silence. After three centuries, the drama of the work hits just as potently in the 21st century.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zqumoMpFKTlDz16YN92On15CLGf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trois histoires sacrées","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Weynants","original_name":"Caroline Weynants","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f66e193388b00395b178e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violaine Le Chenadec","original_name":"Violaine Le Chenadec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f66eb8b959e0034afa982","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davy Cornillot","original_name":"Davy Cornillot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f66f5fd7aa40038e44668","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucile Richardot","original_name":"Lucile Richardot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f6700fd7aa40038e44694","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Fa","original_name":"Judith Fa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5f67093f7e1d003690c88c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Huguet","original_name":"Vincent Huguet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f6719fd7aa4003ae10e97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sébastien Daucé","original_name":"Sébastien Daucé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f6727bdc34c0037ecc4de","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zqumoMpFKTlDz16YN92On15CLGf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
