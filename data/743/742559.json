Following the footsteps of Céline - a local foreigner who has lived in Portugal for 20 years - we are introduced to Ivone Días and Marta Miranda, two female singers from different generations who fight for the survival of their art and their community. Their common language is Fado, a traditional style of music that talks about the daily struggle of living. With the lyrics of fado songs taking us through the story, the film explores the relationship between fado singers and the ever-changing world around them.","popularity":0.0594,"poster_path":"/xHfqBDwXlQCc0e3f01micD9YonL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charneca Bubble","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence - Voices of Lisbon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judit Kamár","original_name":"Judit Kamár","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ef3f3312345003660bdf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Céline Coste Carlisle","original_name":"Céline Coste Carlisle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ef406edeb4300344c7c0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394666,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gábor Halász","original_name":"Gábor Halász","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b0c5bb1057003d9784ab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1313299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mari Miklós","original_name":"Mari Miklós","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b0cfea39490042287b7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882769,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paula Miranda","original_name":"Paula Miranda","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b0d9fb3f610040c7cfcf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961741,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Györgyi Rétfalvi","original_name":"Györgyi Rétfalvi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b0e3907f26003f5a36e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354824,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frigyes Wahl","original_name":"Frigyes Wahl","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b0efbb1057003f96ef90","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13670944","wikidata_id":"Q113486726","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xHfqBDwXlQCc0e3f01micD9YonL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"In-Edit Brasil Festival","release_date":"2020-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Intangible Heritage Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
