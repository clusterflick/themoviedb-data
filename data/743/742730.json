This film traces the origins of the Lebanese conflict, the perception of a society that goes to war while singing. A unique document on the Lebanese civil war. Beyond the religious war, the painting of a social and political reality that has not changed much, more than four decades later.","popularity":0.0484,"poster_path":"/zSDyi2KJM9FtG4U01fkJvuhgFy4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"1975-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lebanon in a Whirlwind","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jocelyne Saab","original_name":"Jocelyne Saab","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/3q5sBq6SVcemvaG4jMD6yTnK8X8.jpg","credit_id":"5f5f7361fd7aa40039e96062","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Stocklin","original_name":"Jörg Stocklin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f73728b959e0033ad9e74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0170146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pFGEr4Dtgo8FrTNGzftlu67jA21.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zSDyi2KJM9FtG4U01fkJvuhgFy4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1333},{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1101,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nANBZdavtOqPy7cW8KVxJV4CTL4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":796}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
