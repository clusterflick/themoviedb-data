Told in five interwoven stories; each situation presents a person, or persons in a delicate moment: fragile, playful, terrified, contemplated, confused, curious…  We are all very much alike in these moments - alerting us to question our own responsibility and responses.  Inspired by Carl Sandburg’s chilling poem of the same name.","popularity":0.1355,"poster_path":"/dHP8124ilc2Ayg4QTiG6wpaKr7D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF |
