All of our country’s biggest public health challenges—from COVID-19 to the opioid crisis to gun violence to lack of insurance—collide in emergency departments. Nearly half of all medical care in the U.S. is delivered in ERs and nurses are on the frontlines, addressing our physical and emotional needs before sending us back out into the world. In Case of Emergency follows emergency nurses across the U.S, shedding light on their efforts to help break a sometimes-vicious cycle for patients under their care.","popularity":0.0966,"poster_path":"/OP5MKFWTNckRZzpYaa8Ykc8Td5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Case of Emergency","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2782423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathlyn Robinson","original_name":"Cathlyn Robinson","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/7L9hcknjEfKLHtOBiHDutYcsBfE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f63dedcaf3da60035242b45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2782424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galina Chavez","original_name":"Galina Chavez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yv9FrAjcrJD0zp1zdUzSPNsIiJp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f63dee5e33f83003cf25bb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2782425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Hanks","original_name":"Jennifer Hanks","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/8b3fBCol1p31Go1SVB17tE7Bsmb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f63deed87f3f2003a82d727","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2782426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheryl Hurst","original_name":"Sheryl Hurst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rkNnYwgVX9eofZyI0t6R5KgXh9E.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f63defadbcade003619b75e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2782427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabih Saad","original_name":"Rabih Saad","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wcyEvS5xTjCm57mK4tACX7lUTR7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f63df016a2227003a81b37f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1321652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolyn Jones","original_name":"Carolyn Jones","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/4gtbV5UbfyZ5wZuibhhzLDWPP4W.jpg","credit_id":"5f5d89fe7d41aa0036ea15e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1321652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolyn Jones","original_name":"Carolyn Jones","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/4gtbV5UbfyZ5wZuibhhzLDWPP4W.jpg","credit_id":"603a984b071650005067c451","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12784352","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sjV4gVcpeUUMhfXikpVPCG9tjaI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1472}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1044,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OP5MKFWTNckRZzpYaa8Ykc8Td5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5UH6StrC0VUVBqkNs0Ip03P3zSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"HIFF2020","release_date":"2020-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"In Case of Emergency\" Official Theatrical Trailer","key":"lnWE8Xi_D5Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-23T21:24:02.000Z","id":"6039d4920f2ae10068fed922"}]}}}
