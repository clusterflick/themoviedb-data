Children study in it, to whom life has left almost no chance. Their parents are most often drug addicts and alcoholics. In their 10-15 years, these children have seen many terrible things. Fighting with a tough bureaucratic system, Sanyok builds special, trusting relationships with them. So close that sometimes it seems like he is one of them. The fates of the guys develop in different ways, but even if they manage to save the life of at least one, Sanya will consider that he did not live his life in vain.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pJSaDVSGhqTHyCHKK0RiAqNGu71.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Fox","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Specials","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Spetsy","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440238,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yury Geytsel","original_name":"Yury Geytsel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f035c156cc70038dd2556","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darya Blagikh","original_name":"Darya Blagikh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f03a1d8cc4a0038ecc108","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2776996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Dranitsyna","original_name":"Anna Dranitsyna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f034e2b93200038e463fe","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2776996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Dranitsyna","original_name":"Anna Dranitsyna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f033b312345003961e43e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2776996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Dranitsyna","original_name":"Anna Dranitsyna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f0354d8cc4a0037e99a91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2777000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxim Pravdin","original_name":"Maxim Pravdin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5f03737d41aa0036f00e43","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/pJSaDVSGhqTHyCHKK0RiAqNGu71.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
