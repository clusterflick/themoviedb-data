But 200,000 of them decided to attempt the adventure of independent Algeria. Over the following decades, political developments would push many of these pieds-noirs into exile towards France. But some never left. Germaine, Adrien, Cécile, Guy, Jean-Paul, Marie-France, Denis and Félix, Algerians of European origin, are among them. Some have Algerian nationality, others do not. Some speak Arabic, others do not. They are the last witnesses to the little-known history of these Europeans who remained out of loyalty to an ideal, a taste for adventure and an unconditional love for a land where they were born, despite all the ups and downs that the free Algeria in full construction had to go through.","popularity":0.3517,"poster_path":"/nwRTxMRDWRfe43GkKKRlYMyYG4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177260,"logo_path":"/2ykbjXBEqbCjUMnXTWzbAwGbeB3.png","name":"Aber
