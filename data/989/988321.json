This is our pick as the ‘most bang for yer buck’ motorsport review of the year. With over seven and a half hours of entertainment across two discs, this is a review that will take more than one sitting, which is great when there’s nothing on the tele and you’re craving the warm days of summer, the screech of tyres, the roar of the exhaust and racing so close you wouldn’t get a postage stamp between the bumpers. With highlights of every race, all shot in HD, and the usual expert commentary and analysis this is simply a must-have for any tintop fan. Or any fan of proper foot-to-the-floor, white knuckle racing for that matter.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":468,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2018 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
