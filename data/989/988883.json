Поэма казанского огня","overview":"The employees of Prometheus were known as brilliant engineers capable of solving problems of a cosmic scale in the truest sense of the word — they, among other things, developed light-and-life devices for the interior design of spacecraft. The ideologist of the team Bulat Galeev was in correspondence with the classics of experimental art: Nicolas Schaeffer, Frank Malina, Yanis Xenakis, Lev Theremin, and although in Soviet times the bureau could not fully participate in the international art process, today many European institutions work with its archives. Didar Orazov's film, which includes digitized archival materials and new interviews with eyewitnesses of the heyday of Prometheus, is an attempt to touch an original phenomenon that the entire Soviet (and not only) intellectual world watched with awe in the second half of the XX century, to tell about what was behind the inspired experiments, about sincere love towards the future and endless curiosity.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8Ddm2wzbK2Jb64wRZysh9rQgYTy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prometheus.
