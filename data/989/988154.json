He celebrates it at home with those closest to him, who have always judged him for his passion for dancing.  When blowing out the candles on the cake, Miguel will wish for absolute solitude, the disappearance of each and every one of his relatives, in order to seek his happiness by doing what he is truly passionate about.  Incredibly, his wish will come true and he will be able to get rid of that mask that he has been wearing for so long.  Being thus alone, isolated and lonely.  A loneliness accompanied by music and tears, this time, caused by happiness.","popularity":0.0587,"poster_path":"/A5zF0U9pQ0Vob9wh0XbqEVm1MD6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CATHARSIS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3589936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicente
