The result? Every year we're left amazed by how every single one of the 30 races throughout the season is packed with close racing which puts championships with much, much bigger team budgets to shame. With more manufacturer-backed teams this season than at any point since the end of the old Super Touring regs this is the best bang-for-your-buck entertainment in motorsport today. 2017 was no exception to the rule: how can you ask for more than going into the last round with the overall champion still to be decided? Would it be Ash Sutton (in only his second year), or could Colin Turkington overhaul the points deficit?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":473,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2017 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
