Every ten years, they hold the Great Ritual. This film focuses on the Great Ritual in 1986. It tries to convey the Saisiat people’s affection for and belief in the legendary little people. At the same time, the film brings into light Saisiat people’s ambivalence towards tourist invasion, and their dilemma of being caught between tradition and modernization. Structured by the Pasta’ay songs’ movements, the film breaks down to 15 chapters. It carefully juxtaposes the visual with the aural elements, which are conveyed in the conceptual dichotomy between “the real” and “the artificial.”","popularity":0.1189,"poster_path":"/h4L6PmlXEBcL9UfdwUtvRwdlrIq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs of Pasta'ay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Tai-Li","original_name":"Hu Tai-Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sHbKZtuCYoEIHaugLEo3O39JD0d.jpg","credit_id":"62aa7728907f2614f76fea3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daw-ming Lee","original_name":"Daw-ming Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66438dbc8c0ffa838abaa228","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daw-ming Lee","original_name":"Daw-ming Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66438dcaa98ba5ed4534d635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"66438dd7e336c993f32a5933","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h4L6PmlXEBcL9UfdwUtvRwdlrIq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
