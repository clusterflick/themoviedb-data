It's here that Cheryl meets the farm's magnificent horse - named after the eponymous steed from her favourite book. With the help of the family's freespirited son, Carey (Chris Hunter), Cheryl learns to face up to her fear of horses and race once again. But just as she starts to rebuild her life, the corrupt Mayor (Peter Jason) conspires to take the farm away from her new family. Now it's up to Cheryl - and Black Beauty - to save those she has come to love.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The legend continues","title":"Black Beauty The Legend Continues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
