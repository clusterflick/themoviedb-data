Back in 1995, he terrorised communities along the north Wales coastline, killing four men and allegedly attacking many more. By day he was a well-respected shopkeeper and cinema owner in Kinmel Bay, and by night he was a sadistic killer who seemed to target gay men.  In this special edition of Dark Land, former chief constable Jackie Roberts returns to re-examine the hunt for the man who would go down in history as Wales’s worst serial killer.  Moore is revealed as a man with a violent secret life, hiding in plain sight. Beneath the façade of a respectable businessman was a mind warped by a dysfunctional upbringing; a man who seized upon a climate of gay prejudice to embark upon a 20-year spree of savage attacks, confident his victims wouldn’t feel able to come forward to complain.  The ultimate question is, could Moore have been stopped before he went on to kill and kill again?","popularity":0.1914,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75884,"logo_path":"/2aaOxLblyFhf0a8C4fkgaYWqjIo.png","name":"Monster Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Land: The Hunt for Wales' Worst Serial Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4351837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Roberts","original_name":"Jackie Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654294dfa58902010703e3ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Moore","original_name":"Peter Moore","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"6542951541a56100fe6de3e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2938400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Rourke","original_name":"James Rourke","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6542958db09bde00e50e1f56","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1138030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Howard","original_name":"David Howard","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654296413e01ea00ade3d9e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640794,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oliver Baker","original_name":"Oliver Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654295eca5890200c91a110e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499478,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Madoc Roberts","original_name":"Madoc Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65429601a5890200c91a1112","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rik Hall","original_name":"Rik Hall","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65429619a5890200c91a1117","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1138030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Howard","original_name":"David Howard","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654296676beaea00ac1e3457","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vSF3YITsnd38ooAgpNscud0NkCn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"},{"id":189402,"name":"crime investigation"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dark Land: The Hunt for Wales Worst Serial Killer - BBC Documentary","key":"nKt9djVFwM8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-07T10:17:09.000Z","id":"654295463e01ea013a8dfc10"}]}}}
