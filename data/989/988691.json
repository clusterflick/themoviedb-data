Asakichi was fascinated by the voice of Oyasu, who sounded exactly like his wife Ochiyo, who had died three years earlier. Asakichi told Oyasu that Ochiyo had fled with him to his home town of Omigawa just before he was deposed by the samurai Shingo Inaba, but that he had put her through a lot of hardship to make her die. Oyasu's husband Tokujiro was a palace carpenter in Edo, but his skills were damaged and he came to take a cure. Asakichi heard about Oyasu's story and offered him money, and Tokujiro's arm was almost completely healed by Oyasu's nursing care.","popularity":0.229,"poster_path":"/ebYjmp4afUJZIIwUSKwN2CcpfT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1955-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ootone no Taiketsu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"大利根の対決","type":"Native Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shōgo Shimada","original_name":"島田正吾","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/nIg2gdgyBPPQhaHkjs5iIhNiKq0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62fbba237eb5f2007ea52730","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryūtarō Tatsumi","original_name":"辰巳柳太郎","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":"/e1PDJVOoPPPq0zLHnoHoP5P13Hb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62fbba32a22d3e0091975c22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1502215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kogiku Hanayagi","original_name":"花柳小菊","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/aHGE7udyCJxZMB0Mc9xI5sfEq9F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62fbba40a22d3e007def34a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenjirō Ishiyama","original_name":"石山健二郎","popularity":0.2673,"profile_path":"/6Qc64jqkcRY1rQ7e8yRwhIFF0nB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62fbba501750510084a42aed","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taizō Fuyushima","original_name":"冬島泰三","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fa35a91dbc88007c8b5b5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisuke Itō","original_name":"伊藤大輔","popularity":0.2862,"profile_path":"/cx7M1NXgGeIiF44uEZ7Dqfp4fTC.jpg","credit_id":"62fbba662dffd8007daee15a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18609,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masaru Satō","original_name":"佐藤勝","popularity":0.5181,"profile_path":"/rprvOr48BOrvaGnFifV5DoVJci8.jpg","credit_id":"67c02bbcc93271491f359f0b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ebYjmp4afUJZIIwUSKwN2CcpfT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1955-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
