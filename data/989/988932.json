Also an indie musician with his bands Railroad Jerk (Matador Records), White Hassle (Glacial Pace Records), and his solo project, he starts his career in New York City and falls deeply in love with it, intoxicated by its never-ending inspirations and possibilities. He’s recorded the city as well as the ups and downs of his personal life for years through his art and music, which are featured seamlessly throughout episodes.  This award winning short series documents his creative journey from being seven-years-old drawing pictures to a successful working artist, and all the stages in between.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":"/trkuRIyzhhL5KuaZs0l392k7ZPh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fourwind Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-06","revenue":500,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A successful piece of art is the tension between the force of nature and your own will as an artist.","title":"Marcellus Hall an Artist in New York City","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Marcellus Hall un Artista en Nueva York","type":"Español"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcellus Hall","original_name":"Marcellus Hall","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/4PBbzYBNWoB2gYXVL6gN2ugX3hl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b0c0b977b1fb0062a563ad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1955108,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Justin Joseph Hall","original_name":"Justin Joseph Hall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/iCXz9168QINqRWD88zkSmCCaOFu.jpg","credit_id":"62b0c0c7f5f1c50061e5e2fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1955108,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Justin Joseph Hall","original_name":"Justin Joseph Hall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/iCXz9168QINqRWD88zkSmCCaOFu.jpg","credit_id":"62b0c0d36beaea0092f03e8a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1955108,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Justin Joseph Hall","original_name":"Justin Joseph Hall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/iCXz9168QINqRWD88zkSmCCaOFu.jpg","credit_id":"62b0c0e172c13e008c5feab8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595799,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Davi","original_name":"Laura Davi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0c0f03cd12c005203bf57","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2390949,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josh Heilbronner","original_name":"Josh Heilbronner","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/5N2sGgdesnTEHCqWgSjBh9bhPRZ.jpg","credit_id":"62b0c116f1b571006124118e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15482456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2fa3KYdbVBKGwX62rPOsO1l7o4q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/trkuRIyzhhL5KuaZs0l392k7ZPh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pUOy076QNIWhXyj4rfUwIozHQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Lake County Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
