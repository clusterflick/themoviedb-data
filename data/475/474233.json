Typical of early film pioneers, he was basically a showman and businessman, but one with a genuine passion for his subject and for recording life without exoticism or condescension. (One intertitle even sarcastically noted: “The Chinese are fond of tender young bamboo shoots, while the Americans, as usual, prefer the kind of fruits and vegetables that grow in cans.”) He subsequently moved to Japan, where he made the documentary Beautiful Japan, which even included material on minorities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o7U6COjcGaxWB2MyQsAVUjke56J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2010-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Brodsky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chin-feng Liao","original_name":"Chin-feng Liao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"641f1a9cc2f44b00a0fadef8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chin-feng Liao","original_name":"Chin-feng Liao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59af2bc8925141076505dc32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1143,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o7U6COjcGaxWB2MyQsAVUjke56J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":762}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
