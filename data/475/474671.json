For these people the “huts” are the perfect setting in which to hide behind the memory of a social status that the crisis of recent years has undermined. A family gets into debt to go on a seaside vacation and to look well-off among the bathers, three women sunbathe in order to feel as if they are still young and to become the stars of the summer, while on the same beach a barman thinks about earning as much money as possible to get through the winter. Everyone is waiting for the night of August 15 to play a leading role in the summer Vanity Fair and to keep on pretending that the economic crisis doesn’t exist.","popularity":0.325,"poster_path":"/n0Rd98UkKAWcsBtHGLsUcTTnJTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94662,"logo_path":"/m8431npr3t3JFaRZFxUOaE9HKVF.png","name":"Indyca","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":47815,"logo_path":"/i083ezPVOG73vFgpE4KkZBuS4KH.png","name":"I Wonder Pictures","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":121324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Onirica","origin_country":""},{"id":68848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenit Arti Audiovisive","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":121325,"logo_path":"/a25PvxuxN6mGwaRTy8tusucyfTn.png","name":"Inthelfilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Winter","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Buon inverno","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Totaro","original_name":"Giovanni Totaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b2fea5c3a3682d87053d22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Totaro","original_name":"Giovanni Totaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c35cacc0e0a265a727c0764","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936450,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrea Maguolo","original_name":"Andrea Maguolo","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3dec39ede1b041ebeb8ebf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210532,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giorgio Giampà","original_name":"Giorgio Giampà","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/x8HqCQXUMyqhUHtxEw9ZWljZk73.jpg","credit_id":"5d3dec4554f6eb001401d888","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2373137,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesca Portalupi","original_name":"Francesca Portalupi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3dec5221621b132aed570a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2254995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Catania","original_name":"Simone Catania","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3dec6121621b4d6bf0204a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1469906,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paolo Ferrari","original_name":"Paolo Ferrari","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcb6ee8e263bb00136f5da6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2373141,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nunzio Gringeri","original_name":"Nunzio Gringeri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcb6ef579a1c30017438447","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7209594","wikidata_id":"Q48814361","facebook_id":"HappyWinter.Film","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/n0Rd98UkKAWcsBtHGLsUcTTnJTu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":966,"name":"beach"},{"id":131,"name":"italy"},{"id":629,"name":"sicily, italy"},{"id":14714,"name":"summer vacation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Mostra del cinema di Venezia 2017","release_date":"2017-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"N-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2018 IFF Kino pavasaris","release_date":"2018-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS (P.O.V.)","release_date":"2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
