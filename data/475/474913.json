She assembles a patchwork of scenes around discrepancies between democratic rhetoric and the reality of racial exclusion, mingling a child's diary entries, stills and home movies, printed texts, street interviews with people attempting to define the meaning of the American flag, and a medley of physical routines in which idiosyncratic dance movements collide with stylized variations on saluting. \"Flag\" flickers with the uncertainties of memory, the evocation of a child's credulous view of equality tempered by an adult knowledge of social hierarchy and oppression. -- Paul Arthur","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Gibson","original_name":"Linda Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b4743bc3a3682a1a0000b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
