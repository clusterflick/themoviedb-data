She was willing to work and slave, if need be, to keep her baby brother, affectionately termed \"The Lump,\" from being sent to the poor house. So she did housework and prepared breakfasts for John Ruffin, an attorney, and Hon. Gedge-Tompkins. John Ruffin's sister, Lady Osterly, has separated from her husband, and he holds their child. When Lady Osterly calls on Ruffin she is struck with the remarkable resemblance Polly bears to her own child. Ruffin and Lady Osterly formulate a plan to come into possession of her daughter, by using Polly as a substitute.","popularity":0.4127,"poster_path":"/7SRvs6xLGgKLLYZFBFT4GpvRk8A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polly Redhead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Hall","original_name":"Ella Hall","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/67A99kOrIVe7CaP7JqxmfWi7qFj.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Polly Redhead","credit_id":"59ad8c57c3a3682c7c04b792","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Astor","original_name":"Gertrude Astor","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/jjIoqFS6mmfZFlhX8pcBhPVzIBJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lady Caroline","credit_id":"59ad8c61925141072f048139","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Duke of Osterley","credit_id":"59ad8c83c3a3682c0a04769a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1378005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Lederer","original_name":"Gretchen Lederer","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/8UZKLwtV5vcC0EBZYVFHRAIHzJD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lady Osterley","credit_id":"59ad8c8f9251410707046a49","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1329604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Wright","original_name":"Helen Wright","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/nNZ8BKDZHdg47DefXffbxXWMjrq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Brown","credit_id":"59ad8c9cc3a3682c0a0476aa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Emmons","original_name":"Louise Emmons","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/fAwxoUe9voAmcWivc8z647nRGcw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Meekin","credit_id":"59ad8cbcc3a3682cc8047c40","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2317657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Webb","original_name":"George Webb","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/6LBbIGJGPZbA8nCW0LNvGRem7zV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"John Ruffin","credit_id":"5ce34dcb9251412cfabe68af","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Conway","original_name":"Jack Conway","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/eMA6PQ0OEnAZM9wZjkflrAO3rkL.jpg","credit_id":"59ad8cd5c3a3682c0a0476cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elliott J.
