As a man of colour and strong supporter of equality, Lumumba chose to speak out against his high-profile boss. What followed was a media storm and an on-air showdown with McGuire which painted Lumumba as an overly PC, hyper-sensitive villain. Through exclusive access to Lumumba, his friends and family, AFL legends Mick Malthouse, former Collingwood Captain Nick Maxwell and sports journalists, Fair Game uncovers the personal and professional journey of a man who at the top of his game, dared to hold a mirror to a nation that didn't like what it saw.","popularity":0.3804,"poster_path":"/26H3vHSFdBYUtyQIExfrL34jIJk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94549,"logo_path":"/cw41bmA1NpxfLyRHMDHbc9bJdmL.png","name":"Common Room Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":11840,"logo_path":"/8oyCRYf6ezxB5h8HJIPVG8JjzgL.png","name":"Film Victoria","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":34936,"logo_path":"/tWQ2ThZbnpwRsNYKOay3MMF94iC.png","name":"JOTZ Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":45531,"logo_path":"/aQ7chdTN42fz0qtmih3yYnDWp4F.png","name":"SBS","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fair Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heritier Lumumba","original_name":"Heritier Lumumba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59aeadc7925141072305366f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Maxwell","original_name":"Nick Maxwell","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59aeade7c3a3682cc8055b0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Malthouse","original_name":"Mick Malthouse","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59aeae0a925141072f055e90","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Robinson","original_name":"Mark Robinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59aeb104c3a3682c220523b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1882557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey Holmes","original_name":"Tracey Holmes","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/nzcwxiTQchpORglhLjGYxbQFaqf.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59aeb141925141076505794f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1452818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Daniels","original_name":"Jeff Daniels","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59aeaf3492514107af055487","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1452818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Daniels","original_name":"Jeff Daniels","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59aeaf4292514107650577a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Zubrycki","original_name":"Tom Zubrycki","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/nPPW0pRmG7ryvsTW7Hsu324UiqE.jpg","credit_id":"59aeaf81c3a3682c7c05a791","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1452818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Daniels","original_name":"Jeff Daniels","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59aeaf8dc3a3682c0a055586","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882554,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tony Stevens","original_name":"Tony Stevens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59aeafe6925141072f056013","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92739,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dale Cornelius","original_name":"Dale Cornelius","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/wkmZzezqMS5wnnjsJdCwYE7Tg5x.jpg","credit_id":"59aeb003c3a3682bf004e6d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4893748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":868,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/26H3vHSFdBYUtyQIExfrL34jIJk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":579}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":193761,"name":"australian rules football"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
