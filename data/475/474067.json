The filmed images are predominantly houses: houses seen in passing along the horizontal; houses reflecting sky and trees in their windows; houses partially hidden by trees or the shadows they cast; houses and office towers simultaneously pictured in stages of demolition and construction. The images dissolve in and out of the flickering light and dark (sunlight and shadow and the emulsion of the film itself). The site of the self is home. A house is a construct and, per Heidegger, language is the house of being.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/vs3R3BUFuOo976XYii74v1GwOvk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tending Towards the Horizontal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1815202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Sternberg","original_name":"Barbara Sternberg","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/9GzMVZrcMUHdr7PookJHUHpX03w.jpg","credit_id":"59add4fcc3a3682c22047e6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0203981","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/11403Zw6i21ICzsVcLZeaFwdWwQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vs3R3BUFuOo976XYii74v1GwOvk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
