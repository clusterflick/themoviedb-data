Without the luxury of social media or even email, the women hand-wrote letters to all their past guests, inviting them to come enjoy the beautiful autumn scenery—with a clambake and some local entertainment thrown in. Director Andrea Meyerson takes viewers on a fascinating 30-year journey, through archival footage and photos, interviews with celebrities and founders, and current events and performances, offering a historical—and hysterical—look at what a handful of innovative women can accomplish.","popularity":0.1854,"poster_path":"/zt61h9OZiCopDdOOTq2mrGLm6a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reflecting on 30 Years of Women's Week in Provincetown","title":"Clambake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":173106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Clinton","original_name":"Kate Clinton","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59b60343c3a3682b3d008892","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":483631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Westenhoefer","original_name":"Suzanne Westenhoefer","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6650f43d202de17a6e7d45a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1226535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Kirson","original_name":"Jessica Kirson","popularity":0.228,"profile_path":"/Aqg5oGF1nPNZbfo9sLAxvXTXg9y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59b60361c3a3682a840088d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Williams","original_name":"Karen Williams","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59b6040cc3a3682b3d0089ee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vickie Shaw","original_name":"Vickie Shaw","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59b6042a9251417cb1008af0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Gonzalez","original_name":"Mimi Gonzalez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59b604569251417ce20086d0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kelly Bertone Pro","original_name":"Kelly Bertone Pro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b427339251415efc002632","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":438724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Meyerson","original_name":"Andrea Meyerson","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/irS1FHnYXHtJecTliYBNEblQE50.jpg","credit_id":"59b42704c3a3684c1300244e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5144260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xdaqxuvOwsfvCcKl4iHpAasD4ON.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zt61h9OZiCopDdOOTq2mrGLm6a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Provincetown Film Festival","release_date":"2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Long Beach QFilm Festival: first release of final cut","release_date":"2015-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
