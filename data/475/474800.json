The musical begins with the story of Georges and his model and lover Dot. As Georges struggles to find his artistic voice, he becomes more and more distant from the one woman who truly sees him for who he really is. A century later, Georges and Dot's descendants, themselves struggling artists, grapple with the same issues of artistic ingenuity, and a public that just doesn't understand. Through melodic and heartbreaking music, poetic lyrics, and quick, jaunty wit, Sunday In the Park With George reveals universal truths about the nature of art, love, and passion, with the breadth and depth of art's most enduring masterpieces.  Filmed live at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in 2013 and broadcast on Mezzo.","popularity":0.9978,"poster_path":"/wR21VGHlDCg31tquffVc2uYCj3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25564,"logo_path":"/hOMyGLs7mSWoDzVkGDYgK0BdVo6.png","name":"Mezzo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday
