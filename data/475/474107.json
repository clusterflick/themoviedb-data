Sam, the sexy young woman who owns the joint, does not have much else in the world and a guest is exciting. But with an ex Special Forces turned policeman brother constantly controlling her and her place, she is a serious obstacle in Mike's search, until she becomes a welcome and dangerous distraction. As their plans escalate and their world narrows, a shattering moment of violence will forever change their futures and reveal the truth behind Mike's arrival and Sam's motives.","popularity":0.4541,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Room 105","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Abrahams","original_name":"Jon Abrahams","popularity":0.7117,"profile_path":"/1gQkeDCmoJ3gjq7VbwvlYKKTKTz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"59ae275492514107af04e3dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Robinson","original_name":"John Robinson","popularity":0.494,"profile_path":"/qoNT5AaBO3JRMzySItJB8AVGSkj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"59ae27bf925141077e04ebb5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":966053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Nicholson","original_name":"Lorraine Nicholson","popularity":0.1993,"profile_path":"/2Qi2L3JFvx873XAXyftn4z3WhAU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5b0ef3c3925141276d001a87","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Mulvihill","original_name":"Patrick Mulvihill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae2777c3a3682c0a04e40c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luke Keen","original_name":"Luke Keen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae278cc3a3682c2204b676","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3106316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
