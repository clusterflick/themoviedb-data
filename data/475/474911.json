The conference brought together an array of dynamic scholars, activists and cultural workers including Essex Hemphill, Kobena Mercer, Barbara Smith, Urvashi Vaid and Jacqui Alexander to interrogate the economic, political and social situations of diasporic lesbians, gay men, bisexual and transgendered peoples. The video brings together the highlights of the conference and draws connections between popular culture and contemporary black gay media production. The participants discuss various topics: Black and queer identity, the shortcomings of Black nationalism, and homophobia in Black communities. Drawing upon works such as Isaac Julien's \"The Attendant\" and Jocelyn Taylor's \"Bodily Functions\", this documentary illuminates the importance of this historic conference for Black lesbians and gays.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":"/dXKCjoAN4z3Bw6obHn2hqMmkomK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Nations/Queer Nations?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jocelyn Taylor","original_name":"Jocelyn Taylor","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/cw0UXSrawwIUV5AodwkSSwgTbxG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c9a8b7b0ba7e006ea44ac8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Julien","original_name":"Isaac Julien","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/3I1Su7TgaUYy1tecYUHDqTrzR2F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Panelist","credit_id":"60c9a8c76c0b3600415bad5d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1868197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shari Frilot","original_name":"Shari Frilot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b472de92514106050007a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7603780","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dXKCjoAN4z3Bw6obHn2hqMmkomK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1560},{"aspect_ratio":0.688,"height":1328,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6RGZ97YpCtsVaUUv9g45ZHdZS7D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":913}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195624,"name":"black lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Nations/Queer Nations? - Trailer - TWN","key":"9NU9Rv12Fjo","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-12-15T16:37:24.000Z","id":"60c9a97217c44300297c3d97"}]}}}
