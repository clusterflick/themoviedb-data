Mortars and rocket propelled grenades rained onto the city, killing indiscriminately, every day. Amongst the madness, two United Nations personnel: a British military officer and another Brit working for the UN Fire Department, decided it would be fun to persuade a global rock star, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, to come and play a gig to the population. Scream for Me Sarajevo brings that story, in all its madness, to the big screen. A story of musicians who risked their lives to play a gig to people who risked their lives to live them.","popularity":0.6866,"poster_path":"/vA1ekBwl2eFmvcWyMJ7Q8s4u6gN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prime Time
