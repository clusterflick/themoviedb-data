Time passes and the director, now in her thirties, seeks out colleagues from that time when those moments began to feel meaningless.

The film follows moments where past passion and present life intersect, reflecting on memories of activism and what came after.​","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"To a Waverer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Da-young","original_name":"Kang Da-young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a4636e2a02919a7617d393","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Bo-mi","original_name":"Kim Bo-mi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a4637f91b0bb72b4ca7888","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Sol-ji","original_name":"Park Sol-ji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a46391c7bfdc7faf17d3ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Eun-kyung","original_name":"Lee Eun-kyung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a463a028e88f65f0fe5e85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Su-bin","original_name":"임수빈","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a463a7aa65d7824a44b85e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Su-bin","original_name":"임수빈","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46312f5360ff3106dee75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Su-bin","original_name":"임수빈","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4631d2abb3b7ac358d8fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Su-bin","original_name":"임수빈","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4632742288f197b17d38f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Su-bin","original_name":"임수빈","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46333e4ad98eb4dca77e2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kil Min-seo","original_name":"Kil Min-seo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4634cc7bfdc7faf17d3ef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
