Sahrawis have been sending to Europe their children for decades, to show the world the injustice they suffer. A 2700 km long mined wall across the desert, and there's no mention of it even in UN resolutions on Western Sahara. This former spanish colony, just in front of Canary Islands, is occupied by Morocco since 1975. In 2011 I spent 5 weeks in the Sahrawi refugee camps near Tindouf, outer south-west of Algeria. This is where the Sahrawi's escape from their war-devastated land stopped, though none of them imagined they would stay there so long. When I met Salka, her foster italian mother Carmen and her mother Aisha, I had finally found what I had been looking for: state of rest began to take shape. Neither Salka nor I were born when it all began. Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco and plundered by many others for over 40 years","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vvO1JkxTHQeGH5IDI75EdDDxaGS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of rest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Maurici","original_name":"Claudio Maurici","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4911dcc11dd66a358db33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33054522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vvO1JkxTHQeGH5IDI75EdDDxaGS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":293194,"name":"youth"},{"id":356810,"name":"sahrawi refugee camps"},{"id":356812,"name":"vacations in peace"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
