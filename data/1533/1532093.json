Portugal is drenched in sunshine—but Ines and João, like vampires, seek refuge in the shadows at a country villa. Their conversations suddenly bring up the story of Baron Gilles de Rais, a possible prototype of the fabled Bluebeard, sentenced to death for the murder of more than 140 children. But was he indeed the killer? Inesh and João decide to stage a trial for the aristocrat.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/1OEtOLpnHK0wy7VsQaJqH7H82og.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44106,"logo_path":"/v4Wwng5Bgmp5HqgYIJXJLpChS7k.png","name":"Leopardo Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Massacre of Gilles de Rais","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Arrais","original_name":"João Arrais","popularity":0.8056,"profile_path":"/nv3k6nWz35k0P6NB8XDAUqqQXEJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68a352622dea0b12ebe95154","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3101721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inês Pires Tavares","original_name":"Inês Pires Tavares","popularity":0.5201,"profile_path":"/c6NnD9Wv1SLD9cNUVbv3YFYi9qT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68a3526aec51f3f47061c7aa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2523161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Branco","original_name":"Juan Branco","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352af9c2b385bf60c0728","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2523161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Branco","original_name":"Juan Branco","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352b42dea0b12ebe95166","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5268,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paulo Branco","original_name":"Paulo Branco","popularity":0.4984,"profile_path":"/fts6IfqRE5xZuZB3iN6yeKNzfhd.jpg","credit_id":"68a352bfa2a9611afb632cfb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682255,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edmundo Díaz Sotelo","original_name":"Edmundo Díaz Sotelo","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352c8c2da87c934ed2062","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2832523,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tiago Augusto","original_name":"Tiago Augusto","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352d38a8341483161c8ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367207,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paulo MilHomens","original_name":"Paulo MilHomens","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352db90e1f7636818e106","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865221,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pedro Góis","original_name":"Pedro Góis","popularity":0.2341,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352e6bdbb85ca8b18d2e2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paulo Lima","original_name":"Paulo Lima","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a352f2263944502002d9db","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37007132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/1OEtOLpnHK0wy7VsQaJqH7H82og.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival of Films Regained GES-2","release_date":"2025-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
