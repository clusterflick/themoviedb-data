The documentary looks at what artificial organs currently in development, the problems they aim to solve, and the challenges that arise if they go wrong. The story follows Nicklas, who needs a new meniscus that has already been printed but which he cannot yet access, driving the narrative. Secondary stories Willem Johan Kolff, the father of modern dialysis, and interviews with 30 industry and academic experts for this ~1-hour documentary. It explores issues like the shortage of stem cells, the complexities of vascularisation, and integrating man-made organs with the human body. Along the way, we examine common challenges shared by different artificial organs. By the end, you'll have the knowledge to outline your own roadmap for understanding and contributing to the field.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4IKOYkelRBEX5IL9v6n5z98frIm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artificial Organs: From Innovation to Industry - part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35636097","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":777,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4IKOYkelRBEX5IL9v6n5z98frIm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":582}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
