In the quiet of his backyard, he chooses to spend the last day before the world transforms beyond recognition alongside his mother. There, he witnesses the signs — the unrest of animals, the uprising of plants — while confronting the imminence of loss: not only the loss of a future he once imagined, but also the fragile bond that ties him to this woman and to this place. Guided by poetry, Late on the Planet is a meditation on the weight we give to the idea of finitude and on our precarious relationship with the more-than-human world. Inspired by the novel of the same name by Leonardo Piana.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":271633,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Veneta","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In their backyard, a mother and her son share the final day on Earth.
