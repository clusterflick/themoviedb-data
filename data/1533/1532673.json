Her only warning of its approach is a faint hum detected by her cochlear implant. Clinging to the hope that her missing family will return, she refuses to leave her fortified home, even as the military prepares to destroy the entire area.\r When two mysterious intruders arrive claiming they can destroy the creature using a bomb “fueled by Hell,” Sami’s world begins to unravel. Childhood trauma resurfaces, memories shift, and her grip on reality weakens. In a climactic confrontation, Sami deploys the bomb and wakes in a hospital to a reunion with her long-lost family. But as buried truths surface, she realizes the reunion isn’t real.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/Z9SC4KiyVkoFz66minanrBNo5Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes The Only Way Out is Through the Dark","title":"The Womb","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1285,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Z9SC4KiyVkoFz66minanrBNo5Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
