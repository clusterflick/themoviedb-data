Students, alumni, and faculty present eleven shorts exploring everyday images across film, photography, painting, games, animation, and advertising through contemplative, critical, and satirical approaches. From supercut aesthetics to structural compositions and essayistic narration, each work examines how images generate meaning. While functioning independently, these shorts intersect within a shared framework, offering new perspectives on viewing moving images.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60264,"logo_path":"/dufUwEz5RcpEDe8UZtyXcFE5Yxa.png","name":"Korea National University of Arts","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Fragments Across the Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Si-won","original_name":"Kim Si-won","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4692741fb1467befe5c5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Se-arm","original_name":"Park Se-arm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46941205825cdaf44b850","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chung Ji-won","original_name":"Chung Ji-won","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46956d7d276b009fe5ca4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Yun-seo","original_name":"Kim Yun-seo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4696f50616173d2fe5d06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Da-young","original_name":"Kang Da-young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46984e52be272a558d959","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Min-a","original_name":"Kim Min-a","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a469994a808d2c7344b8ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4408633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Young-hae","original_name":"장영해","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a469c9c86b194177ca77db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Seung-Jin","original_name":"Lee Seung-Jin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46a2ae130480e60fe5c97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"An Hyun-jung","original_name":"An Hyun-jung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46a3f58c0bf151dca77ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4541745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HwiHwi","original_name":"HwiHwi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46a4bb6f5818ece44b920","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Chae-lin","original_name":"Lee Chae-lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a46a75edcebf687d6ded6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9706,"name":"anthology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
