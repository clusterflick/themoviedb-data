In it film maker and playwright Carmel Winters joins their dog pack in re-imagining the death of their mother and their dog not as the end, but as the beginning of new ways of seeing and being with each other, through death and beyond.  The film maker shot the film every day for three years, returning to the same landmarks time and time again as a kind of pilgrimage in pack mind. This footage was contracted to a 27 min swoop through liminal time, in which eternity seems to pass through now as this queer and quirky family ingeniously use the arts of performance, playwriting and film to sniff out meaning – and humour – in loss.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/5aXUM3WrofeHa1UUIhj7nzS2SO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Loss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1107513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmel Winters","original_name":"Carmel Winters","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a335e9d12985d8fd870a00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5aXUM3WrofeHa1UUIhj7nzS2SO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
