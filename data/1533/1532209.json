The Primitchibu World is not so much a narrative film as a performance and mood piece, inspired and driven by the music of singer-songwriter, performer, and essayist Takeshi Shirai, a.k.a. Primitchibu (the moniker is a play on words on 'primitive' and the Japanese for 'private parts'). There is a premise: a girl who sells flowers to passersby in the streets meets a boy who believes that war will break out if he traverses a shopping arcade and emerges at the other end.  - Tom Mes http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/the-primitchibu-world/","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oL6TWzPnlbv5bkG9L2jawWxhtXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Primitchibu World - Purimichibu na Sekai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2317438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kasumi Hiraoka","original_name":"Kasumi Hiraoka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a382f6c9de62e3e5f67014","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":760,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/oL6TWzPnlbv5bkG9L2jawWxhtXI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"『プリミ恥部な世界』予告編 \"THE PRIMITCHIBU WORLD-ALL FILM VERSION-\" official trailer","key":"XSfPpcrshIE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2010-10-05T03:48:41.000Z","id":"68a382b9c1fa67a973a20262"}]}}}
