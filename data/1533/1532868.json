The 11-minute black-and-white film follows Charlie, a mischievous chimpanzee, as he learns an important lesson about bicycle safety. On his way to school, Charlie repeatedly ignores traffic rulesâ€”riding on the sidewalk, failing to signal, disobeying pedestrian crossings, and even giving his chimpanzee girlfriend a ride. After a conversation with a policeman, Charlie understands the importance of following safety regulations. On his next trip, he becomes a model cyclist, demonstrating responsible riding behavior. The film uses humor and engaging storytelling to teach young viewers about road safety.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkey Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
