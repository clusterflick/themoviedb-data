Crafted through an innovative amalgamation of scenes from the iconic video game Grand Theft Auto V and Connolly’s original animations, this piece diverges from the game’s central narrative of property theft, violence and mayhem. Instead, it delves into the stark realities of everyday life for its characters, navigating through themes of homelessness, illness, loss, patriarchal control, and a pervasive sense of powerlessness. These narratives unfold against the backdrop of Los Angeles’ neon-lit streets, which, despite their brilliance, echo the desolation of a faded dream.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Descent into Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265398,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jacky Connolly","original_name":"Jacky Connolly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a52819925acb319425eee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrlrsiJSnkeVl5x1LkRfdH1IBdy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Whitney Biennial","release_date":"2022-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
