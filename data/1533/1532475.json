The film follows the monks and nuns through intimate, observational storytelling as they navigate postwar devastation—working towards peace, even in the face of grave personal loss. Poetic imagery and an hypnotic score accompany \"Mar Musa\" emerging as a profound metaphor for Syria itself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9uOzjbfkMgZZP8gl2eAzSYV9YcZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Mar Musa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Schahab Kermani","original_name":"Schahab Kermani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a459a1a152f9f3529f60b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Schahab Kermani","original_name":"Schahab Kermani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a459bc1f003e4b1dfe5bf4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Schahab Kermani","original_name":"Schahab Kermani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a459cd61507d74cada58fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markéta Poldednová","original_name":"Markéta Poldednová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a459de720735113a17d41a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9uOzjbfkMgZZP8gl2eAzSYV9YcZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
