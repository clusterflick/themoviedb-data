A fire has been raging inside Dewi, too. Born to a young single mother on Indonesian soil, Dewi was adopted by white American parents as an infant, renamed “Amy,” and raised in white suburbia in the U.S.— a story her parents framed as a simple, happy story. But Dewi is noticing the cracks in their narrative. She realizes she is not, never has been, the daughter they see.  Driven by a deep sense of loss of her culture, family, and land, Dewi discovers and reclaims her birth name, builds community with other transracial adoptees, and begins excavating stories from her Native Bornean ancestry. It pushes her relationship with her 83-year-old adoptive mother to the brink.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Not Amy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","original_name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a4a0fc3b2f57dcfc3e8113","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Good Feather","original_name":"Doug Good Feather","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a4a10874b6374dc1834576","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Rush","original_name":"Gene Rush","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a4a11f96b1e52396a81137","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Woo Ae Yi","original_name":"Woo Ae Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a4a12d4ada12cb3fd547a7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","original_name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4a098b69b64981ca8112d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","original_name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4a0acd77b8aaf0525eb30","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","original_name":"Dewi Sungai Marquis-Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4a0be20b6ea12fe3e813e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5635963,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jason Houston","original_name":"Jason Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4a0e0b579937917fd215e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32194956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Colorado Dragon Boat Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
