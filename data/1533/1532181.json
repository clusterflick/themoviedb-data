Steve Dahl, a popular Chicago rock radio DJ, led an anti disco crusade throughout the late 1970's. His movement was intended to purge disco culture from the mainstream media. Dahl's anti homosexual messages made it clear that disco, a rapidly growing and transgressive art form, was threatening to Dahl's mostly straight and white audience. On July 12, Dahl blew up thousands of disco records on the Comiskey Park outfield during the intermission of a Chicago White Sox double header. A riot ensued after the explosion, causing the White Sox to forfeit the second game. This was only the second forfeit in MLB history. And yet, Dahl's anti-disco efforts were a success, and helped lead to the demise of disco. Disco Demolition Night can be seen as a precursor to the conservative backlash of the 80's.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disco Inferno: The Homophobic Roots of Disco Demolition Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6340672","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
