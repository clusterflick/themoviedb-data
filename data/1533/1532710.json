Among the dead was Joaquin “Guac” Oliver. Joaquin’s father - and now activist - Manuel Oliver transforms his grief into a joyous celebration of life and advocacy. From pepperoni bacon pizza to air guitar solos, Oliver paints a vivid portrait of a vibrant life cut short. Guac: A Portrait of Love, Joy & Tragedy doesn’t just tell one family’s story - it speaks to anyone who has loved, lost or dreamed of making a difference. Shot in front of a live audience at the world-famous Public Theatre in New York City, Guac: A Portrait of Love, Joy & Tragedy brings out the inner activist in all of us.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guac: A Portrait of Love, Joy & Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Bickerton","original_name":"Mike Bickerton","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a4d5ac85f96f14cd5dcfa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
