Amanda, a young woman drained after a reckless night, faces the cruel aftermath of a careless lover. Ana, a middle-aged secretary, endures the suffocating weight of workplace harassment hidden behind corporate emails. Alicia, a teenager trapped between schoolwork and online prostitution, drifts through chats that reveal the absurdity of adult hypocrisy. Through contradictory inner monologues that clash with their outward actions, the film exposes the fragile, bitterly ironic subtext of contemporary female lives in Latin America.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7TOTvqflA7RqXvKixnL7VL1DNzH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265407,"logo_path":null,"name":"MER","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Three women, three screens, one cruel inner voice","title":"Subtext","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5507494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mahiara Sáenz","original_name":"Mahiara Sáenz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a5470c7eef5f4afebcb386","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5507494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mahiara Sáenz","original_name":"Mahiara Sáenz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a5471f069561184025ed4e","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5507494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mahiara Sáenz","original_name":"Mahiara Sáenz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a5472e4b7bd93a01fd2460","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2806,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7TOTvqflA7RqXvKixnL7VL1DNzH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1984},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2806,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5UMQI6P3lgSQkmEzFqXi2kRzM1B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2806,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9JWrn5l20GKnkEY1JrIVuTO7jwW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":4553,"name":"black humor"},{"id":293749,"name":"social critique"},{"id":300184,"name":"irony"},{"id":301767,"name":"digital era"},{"id":304348,"name":"internal monologue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
