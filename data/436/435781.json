In hurrying and neglecting an infection on my right thumb, I had to film more or less with one hand and then spend two days in hospital. I can only think that the making of this little film reflects all the difficulties previously faced by Yann himself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foryannfromrose","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1286993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rose Lowder","original_name":"Rose Lowder","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/iRDL93tiLU9Sp5SANiMG8wGug6.jpg","credit_id":"587f97bfc3a36854fe000c0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12324822","wikidata_id":"Q59639766","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Light Cone","release_date":"2015-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
