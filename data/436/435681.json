Fischer described his journey in a book, Hobalala, but committed suicide one week before it was published. By taking up Marc Fischer's quest, following his steps one by one, thanks to all the clues he left us, we pursue João Gilberto to understand the history, the very soul and essence of Bossa Nova. But who can tell whether we will meet him or not?","popularity":0.4348,"poster_path":"/b7OFigj5bHCLdbNqNvm92VXqaBs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges
