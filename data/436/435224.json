It concentrates on describing and attempting to explain the origins of the policy of “terror” instigated by Stalin as leader of the USSR.  There are interviews with surviving family members and experts all of whom attempt some sort of personality “analysis” of the dictator to explain his behaviour and policies. Another question that is examined is, given his record of “terror”, why was he so popular? Why did so many Russians mourn his death in 1953?  This could be an overview and introduction to a study of both Stalin and USSR in the post revolution period.","popularity":0.5259,"poster_path":"/bBfBWg3hOkC1deR86lSYHRhMBuo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/cey5EAFwOb7AfDOsQ4p4q5MixzX.png","name":"BBC Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"an intimate portrait of the greatest monster of the 20th century","title":"Stalin: Inside the Terror","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kira Alliluyeva","original_name":"Kira Alliluyeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"587bc14a9251413ecb0118f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kira Alliluyeva","original_name":"Kira Alliluyeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Polina Molotov","credit_id":"587bc16392514141430067ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siân Phillips","original_name":"Siân Phillips","popularity":0.4169,"profile_path":"/k2OIQZUWLTlZYfHjpS5X8csYbSY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"587bc17e92514141430067bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Service","original_name":"Robert Service","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"587bc1ac9251413e920117d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1583773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Shekhovtsov","original_name":"Сергей Шеховцов","popularity":0.2678,"profile_path":"/toig1WMkEPqcroxj0fgWqQjqCbR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vorosthlov","credit_id":"587bc1d4c3a36847e8012bdd","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0429121","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bBfBWg3hOkC1deR86lSYHRhMBuo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6539,"name":"joseph stalin"},{"id":231752,"name":"russian leaders"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
