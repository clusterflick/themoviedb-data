Here the 82nd US airborne were, as elsewhere, denied coup de main attacks to seize the bridges by the air commanders. While the Grave Bridge was captured, confusion in US orders meant that the barely defended bridge in Nijmegen was only attacked when the Germans had taken the opportunity to reinforce the garrison. The resulting battle to regain control of the situation is an epic of Anglo-American military history. This programme tells the story of the amazing courage of the American and British soldiers who won this battle against desperate odds.","popularity":0.4145,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72143,"logo_path":null,"name":"BHTV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Market Garden: Nijmegen","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"OP Market Garden - Nijmegen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Hook","original_name":"Jo Hook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"587f8ab1c3a3682ea200bb53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Greenacre","original_name":"John Greenacre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"587f8aca92514138fe00bf3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Peters","original_name":"Mike Peters","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"587f8ae292514138ef00bcb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"587f8af592514138f300b4e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"587f8b1492514138fe00bfb2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hone","original_name":"Richard Hone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"587f8b2992514138f500b9a8","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4595,"name":"us army"},{"id":193900,"name":"arnhem"},{"id":222687,"name":"german army"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
