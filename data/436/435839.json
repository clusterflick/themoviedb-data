The first of several expensive costume dramas upon which the director established his international reputation, the film stars Elisa Cegani as Marcella, a model in the dress shop owned by enterprising Umberto Melnati. To improve his business, the owner instructs his models to dress up as society ladies and attend all the best parties. And that's how humble little Marcella comes to be mistaken for the popular Duchess of Parma -- and by extension, how our heroine wins the love of football hero Gino Vanni (Antonio Centa). A little wanting in the way of plot or logic, La Constessa di Parma is at least consistently good to look at.","popularity":0.1459,"poster_path":"/dzbgiROqwbTavI7CiGC8W1KbCwX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Industrie Cinematografiche Italiane (ICI)","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Duchess of Parma","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Cegani","original_name":"Elisa Cegani","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/msaJ0GvlHSBiUvmI0sHh0x48e26.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marcella","credit_id":"5a75649e0e0a266439030d78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Centa","original_name":"Antonio Centa","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/eKDbGjxlzDkynn8QFWSkygWRiUJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gino Vanni","credit_id":"5a7564be0e0a26642d031463","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umberto Melnati","original_name":"Umberto Melnati","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/rFdVE4KywrqAD4QWoCRTs2qxoxS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carrani","credit_id":"5a7564cac3a3685a1b02d835","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550292,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Gino Carlo Sensani","original_name":"Gino Carlo Sensani","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d136b666ae4d008c91c8f5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Blasetti","original_name":"Alessandro Blasetti","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":"/kCfrlaYan7qJfYg4PPNZeAxtXs4.jpg","credit_id":"59db2810925141252c0549bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0028740","wikidata_id":"Q3688869","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dzbgiROqwbTavI7CiGC8W1KbCwX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
