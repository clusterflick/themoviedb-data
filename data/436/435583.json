His struggles with everyday life, his past, even the question of 'the existence of a higher power', have led him to evaluate his own life. An assessment, that ultimately drives him to leave work and success behind, and set out on a quest in search of his happiness. But Dante soon learns that it's not that simple, for after a series of painfully humorous attempts fail to provide an answer, Dante sinks even deeper. It is not until he encounters Cynthia, a spiritual guide of sorts, that he uncovers the underlying truth and finally arrives at an answer that surprises even him.","popularity":2.0265,"poster_path":"/3ghtmg3THEVcXEyBXQCqLOS5A0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes your eyes don't see what your heart already knows.","title":"Calling It Quits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Boutsikaris","original_name":"Dennis Boutsikaris","popularity":0.6635,"profile_path":"/eholEaSnVKzse1l7ph6hDsfTTi7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dante","credit_id":"587e4223c3a36847e80279e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Hecht","original_name":"Jessica Hecht","popularity":1.2044,"profile_path":"/5JVd1ZLnhdZVFInDy8Zut9M1M5C.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Cynthia","credit_id":"67fbab11765c5222f3991dd2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Clohessy","original_name":"Robert Clohessy","popularity":0.643,"profile_path":"/lhNUk6PF0mNhgbvTDxXfIy4uhRe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"587e42439251413f3302646c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Bonan","original_name":"Marc Bonan","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Young Dante","credit_id":"587e4219c3a3684a9e023b7b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Aberdeen","original_name":"Robert Aberdeen","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/6yr4Xy4iYRynHK2qHccNwPfYAIu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gastroenterologist","credit_id":"587e41fdc3a3684a6502759b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1740595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Berndt","original_name":"Julie Berndt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xSG9bvyrJTvirF6Xk2CV0b4i1Vk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Deborah","credit_id":"587e4205c3a36847e80279d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty Blake","original_name":"Matty Blake","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":"/dl8Dyx3iSpgspdlP4xMS3KHTBN9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cal","credit_id":"587e420f9251413eec0249eb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":205701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Bush","original_name":"Kristen Bush","popularity":0.3388,"profile_path":"/49E7PbR3KOdjXnHZ2TIlSMnY74j.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Young Alba","credit_id":"587e422d925141410101a257","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1232484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orlagh Cassidy","original_name":"Orlagh Cassidy","popularity":0.2446,"profile_path":"/oF0M60D6X9JUwrMIAEzB13oorbL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marcy -
