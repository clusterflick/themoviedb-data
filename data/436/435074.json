But Also..., for the country back in 1971. Rob Brydon narrates this very special programme as Pete and Dud fans, friends and colleagues watch these newly discovered clips in the studio for the very first time. The programme includes contributions from Not Only... But Also... producer Dick Clement, Pete and Dud collaborator Barry Humphries, and long-time fans Richard Ayoade, Josie Lawrence, Will Sharpe and Ronnie Wood as they enjoy the sketches and reflect on the career of one of Britain's best-loved comedy partnerships.","popularity":1.2625,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Cook and Dudley Moore: The Missing Sketches","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Cook","original_name":"Peter Cook","popularity":0.4443,"profile_path":"/wytpiTl3Wgr3T2kdMgcP88WIbLu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"587aaa049251413f1b0081d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dudley Moore","original_name":"Dudley Moore","popularity":1.3228,"profile_path":"/8xLueKMu5tpBmLNzZ73eWBNHycW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"587aaa129251413f460077c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Brydon","original_name":"Rob Brydon","popularity":1.0649,"profile_path":"/xoKLZVwzaUgTUEvPX4vymXpC1fU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"587aaa1ec3a3684a9e007829","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Humphries","original_name":"Barry Humphries","popularity":0.7506,"profile_path":"/gtOAbs8ZFJiDDRPPock1qmP4V18.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587aaa28c3a3684a65007f60","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Clement","original_name":"Dick Clement","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/aTg0CgC98AtByASkrxuJs2FlT28.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587ab173c3a368494c00762f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ayoade","original_name":"Richard Ayoade","popularity":1.9539,"profile_path":"/qHKoy9kP4bsv4G9EkvU4FMUmYkS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587aaa329251413f33007e5d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Wood","original_name":"Ronnie Wood","popularity":0.3169,"profile_path":"/x9cPzzqEOLIuvwsqfqoDTdXeeny.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587aaa3dc3a368494c0072b7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Shearer","original_name":"Harry Shearer","popularity":0.6304,"profile_path":"/7PnGZGVKJNDTUv3DkbaMEnCseT0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587acb0b9251413f1b0097b8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":157758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josie Lawrence","original_name":"Josie Lawrence","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/nJCPwGpzaJlet1tzXAujjDYCMdK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587aaa4cc3a36849ff007451","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Sharpe","original_name":"Will Sharpe","popularity":2.872,"profile_path":"/1pzdCm3m1kWn7YLTMbVvwT5O4jZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587aaa559251413f1b0081f8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Fiddy","original_name":"Dick Fiddy","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587aaa7f9251413f1b008212","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Dean","original_name":"Richard Dean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587acae2c3a3684a650094b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6674126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Channel 4","release_date":"2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
