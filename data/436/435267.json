While her diary tells the story of Anne's life, the story of her death reveals the atrocities encountered by millions of Jews during the Holocaust. In a solemn remembrance of the horrors that Anne Frank and these millions of others suffered during the dark days of World War II, National Geographic Channel (NGC) takes viewers inside the concentration camps in a two-hour special. In keeping with NGC's tradition of unparalleled storytelling, Anne Frank's Holocaust incorporates new findings and rarely seen photographs to reintroduce the story of the massacre of Jews in one of the most comprehensive documentaries on the subject to date.","popularity":2.2057,"poster_path":"/xlZ3jaErwUn8IwscMwDK8Te2rmw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anne Frank's Holocaust","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26162,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Frank","original_name":"Anne Frank","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/5ex70IPbbsMwSEqWmRPB7Zn9ZU5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"writer","credit_id":"615db01e944a57002700ef3a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4798956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k76ibggHbHkHfgRsD5V9FIAkYD4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2TUufsfDvvDySqFyFd2uxPrz6y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1068},{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xlZ3jaErwUn8IwscMwDK8Te2rmw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
