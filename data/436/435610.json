At nearly the same time, a very plain looking lower middle class woman simply faints and suffers brain death. The beautiful womans brain is fine, so, doctors merely transplant her brain into plain Jane. Problems ensue when plain Janes husband continues to believe she is still his wife. She has no memory of him, and goes to live with the beautiful womans husband. She doesn't mix well with her new socialite friends and family. Mirrors are emotional battlefields as well.","popularity":3.0039,"poster_path":"/fdoWDvB04ouJrfuKPY4AOtvIwd4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88832,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBS Broadcast
