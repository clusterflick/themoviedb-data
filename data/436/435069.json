He is at once admired, respected and envied by the other animals. However, Hedgehog’s unwavering devotion to his home annoys and mystifies a quartet of insatiable beasts: a cunning fox, an angry wolf, a gluttonous bear and a muddy boar. Together, the haughty brutes march off towards Hedgehog’s home to see just what is so precious about this “castle, shiny and huge.” What they find amazes them and sparks a tense and prickly standoff.","popularity":0.3096,"poster_path":"/AqoaLTJKCTv3oUvNJYJUCzs96L4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonobostudio","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF
