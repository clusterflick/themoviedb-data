Social and architectural constructions are fragmented and dashing past. Cityscapes attempts to make archived recordings from the Austrian Film Museum legible along these lines.

Cityscapes is a search along the tracks of these images.","popularity":0.194,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cityscapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michaela Grill","original_name":"Michaela Grill","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587ba9aec3a36846c300deac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Siewert","original_name":"Martin Siewert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587ba9bb9251413f1b0114e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6709590","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
