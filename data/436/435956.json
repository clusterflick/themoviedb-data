The crew travels from town to town filming bands performing in houses that're about to be demolished or burned to the ground. In one day they document the house, the bands, and the demolition, then put it together in a 50-minute movie and move on to the next town. Extras include an extended slide show of stills of the day's bands as well as stills of the destruction and film production.","popularity":0.5007,"poster_path":"/6IDZ4a6i8nkNw6cxkRRLFU4UUTK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burn to  Shine - Vol. 3: Portland, OR 06.15.2005","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":586998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Brownstein","original_name":"Carrie Brownstein","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/3sjiZL9K8TwbL6BO5rWVhkeafbx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586e05c3a36805e886a6fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corin Tucker","original_name":"Corin Tucker","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/5bwdtjM5qlnzEKISksDkSLOkrHw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586e439251415e346a21e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2234639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Weiss","original_name":"Janet Weiss","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/tjbenNSgxfk96YzVECCwn5Ju0sP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586e4bc3a36872908b0e2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Meloy","original_name":"Colin Meloy","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/lNNaQMLtzDt9YJ7gHGviiDhpsPe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586e5292514116fc5a7ecb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Funk","original_name":"Chris Funk","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586ea60e0a26185ac8dc18","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1194154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Conlee","original_name":"Jenny Conlee","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/6P2CymYe5b647bUV1LP5uYNsFeq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586ec792514135b051e897","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Query","original_name":"Nate Query","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586ee7c3a368302887b4ab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Moen","original_name":"John Moen","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586ef6c3a368424686f9cd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1412068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Ditto","original_name":"Beth Ditto","popularity":0.1382,"profile_path":"/s5RYh8y0Cig3GVvyCis6tX0I7aH.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586f130e0a26185ac8dce0","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Green","original_name":"Christoph Green","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c586f3f0e0a2601d6d4a6cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1091,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6IDZ4a6i8nkNw6cxkRRLFU4UUTK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
