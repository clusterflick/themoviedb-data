Itâ€™s midwinter during the trailblazing 1888-89 tour (17 months and a staggering 107 matches) that left a black jersey and silver fern legacy. In a changing room that resembles a casualty ward, Warbrick draws breath and leads a stirring haka. Made by brothers Pere and Meihana Durie, Warbrick inspired the All Blacks the day before a 33-6 demolition of Australia in 2009.","popularity":0.4351,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warbrick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Tuteao","original_name":"Calvin Tuteao","popularity":0.1992,"profile_path":"/3GVIQySK1HOf8CZ824W30AEN4gY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Joe Warbrick","credit_id":"587cfcc6c3a3684a4a01d2ce","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Durie","original_name":"Pere Durie","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587cfce49251413ecb01bf99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meihana Durie","original_name":"Meihana Durie","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587cfcf2925141414300ef5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"},{"id":2659,"name":"maori"},{"id":7912,"name":"rugby"},{"id":227589,"name":"all blacks"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
