Her cinematic universe has influenced entire generations. As a young woman, she brought the international art world to the sleepy town of Konstanz. It all began on the shores of Lake Constance where Ulrike Ottinger was born and where she still often spends time. Filmmaker Brigitte Kramer chose to begin her film at Lake Constance since she too shares Ottinger’s birthplace and a great love of these waters. This is also where the filmmaker’s own artistic development began, not least as a result of her encounter with Ottinger and her work. Other fellow travellers and friends appearing in this film include art historian Katharina Sykora, collector and curator Ingvild Goetz, film historian Ulrich Gregor, philosopher Bernd Scherer and actor Irm Hermann. Using this common ground as a starting point for an exploration of Ottinger’s substantial oeuvre, this documentary provides a keen insight into the artist’s life and work.","popularity":0.2536,"poster_path":"/g3KpgIGWwvcEI79SQpj0b2ArWH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulrike Ottinger: Nomad from the Lake","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"587c4622925141410100a9d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1739687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingvild Goetz","original_name":"Ingvild Goetz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"587c462b925141414300a2fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"587c4632c3a36846c3012240","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Mattes","original_name":"Eva Mattes","popularity":0.407,"profile_path":"/63ET2xZ3ezbDGKwXxz2eqwX0pxB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"587c4638c3a368494c013e38","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigitte Kramer","original_name":"Brigitte Kramer","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587c4665925141414300a315","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2187165","wikidata_id":"Q23930833","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/g3KpgIGWwvcEI79SQpj0b2ArWH8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1254}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
