Along the way he witnesses the effects of severe drought. The next day, in the St. George Tabernacle, he receives inspiration that by paying tithing, the \"windows of heaven\" will open, pouring out blessings. He promises the people that they can plant crops and rain will come, then continues to preach tithing as he returns home where he awaits favorable weather reports from St. George.","popularity":0.1314,"poster_path":"/7OOTWN9w8toZ0MN1he7HcS0l9Sq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brigham Young University","origin_country":""},{"id":46433,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Windows of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis L.
