The worst part is that this violation of human rights is protected by the Spanish Ministry of Interior itself, which hinders any effective action by the prosecution. For this reason, the civil society plays a fundamental role in revealing the facts. This is where the figure of collective complaints (DESC Observatory and the association Coordinadora de Barrios) steps in.","popularity":0.2694,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Observatori DESC","origin_country":""},{"id":85504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metromuster","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tarajal: Desmontando la impunidad en la frontera sur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Tarajal: Dismantling Impunity on the Southern Border","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Tarajal: Deconstructing Impunity at the Southern Border","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Tarajal Desmuntant La Impunitat a La Frontera Sud","type":"catalan title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Artigas","original_name":"Xavier Artigas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587ac4a4c3a3684a4a009439","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xapo Ortega","original_name":"Xapo Ortega","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587ac4bac3a3684a4a009451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Artigas","original_name":"Xavier Artigas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587ac5d29251413eec0087dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xapo Ortega","original_name":"Xapo Ortega","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587ac5e59251413f33008f16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Serra","original_name":"Marc Serra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587bce0cc3a36846c300f2fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":972,"name":"refugee"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":2173,"name":"illegal immigration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
