In this dream-like aquatic world between Germany and Poland, sea eagles breed so close to one another that one could be excused for considering it a colony. The first wolf pack in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania settled here years ago in the Oder Delta. Huge herds of wild horses cross the vast plains, while bison roam the forests of the Polish side.  This film tells the dramatic story of a lonely bison bull that found its way across the border into Germany and reveals intimate insights into the domestic life of the beaver. The absolute highlight has to be the 200 sea eagles that came to the Anklamer Stadtbruch during the summer. A natural spectacle that one can only experience in the Oder-Delta.","popularity":0.1787,"poster_path":"/yhT8wtJ1DOQXPqlKLBNJIJ8pYbh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR
