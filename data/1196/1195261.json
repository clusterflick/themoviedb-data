The story follows the experiences of a black queer person living in Bahia, Brazil, as they navigate their passions, personal conflicts, and growth. The film challenges the conventional notion of love, suggesting that to un-love, one must first love. It explores the idea that there is more love in DesAmor (un-love) than in traditional love, and that self-love is a crucial aspect of this process. The protagonist's journey is one of self-discovery, as they learn to prioritize their own needs and desires, even when it means letting go of romantic relationships that no longer serve them. Through the ups and downs of their personal journey, they come to understand that true love begins with loving oneself.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/iNTUpGTk7KYVlD2hOvemxPrjYo3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DesAmor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Ayres","original_name":"Douglas Ayres","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6536db814083b300c3c94794","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaci Conceição","original_name":"Joaci Conceição","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6536db8794631800e38256e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macário","original_name":"Macário","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6536db9085b10500c7bd206a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isa Oliveira","original_name":"Isa Oliveira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6536dba185b105010199e2a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Thomaz","original_name":"Jon Thomaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6536dba994631800c6b54eca","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macário","original_name":"Macário","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536db4c1f748b00ae128e20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macário","original_name":"Macário","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536db4394631800e38256cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Quésia Pacheco","original_name":"Quésia Pacheco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536db57ae3668010b9b701d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27629116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/iNTUpGTk7KYVlD2hOvemxPrjYo3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
