At age 15, he is involved in a local youth program aimed at both healing generational trauma and combating the lure of gang violence. While his survival depends on street smarts, his loving single mother (Carla Vila) uses tough love to keep him on the right path. A heartfelt debut from director Junior Gonzalez, THESE DAYS is a thoughtful, moving docudrama portrait of a vibrant Long Island community, as seen through the eyes of a promising young artist.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/2mKEQ8jvFQKxeLYgd7zEoSvOfil.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"These Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4336213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Mayorga Reyes","original_name":"Billy Mayorga Reyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"6536f528c50ad2012df45c8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1655400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Vila","original_name":"Carla Vila","popularity":0.192,"profile_path":"/amY9drkYuaGFD0vgpVonpqv7wld.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alma","credit_id":"6536f5d6f495ee00ad09ffc5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4336212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Gonzalez Jr.","original_name":"Edward Gonzalez Jr.","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536f51085b105011e252c31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078837,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Junior Gonzalez","original_name":"Junior Gonzalez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536f5eeae366800c91073e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11416126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1676,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2mKEQ8jvFQKxeLYgd7zEoSvOfil.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1113}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
