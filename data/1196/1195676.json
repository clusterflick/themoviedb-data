This attack left 1300 killed and 6000 injured. The film addresses the social and psychological impacts of war on the people of Gaza through the testimony of Dr. Eyad Sarraj, a psychotherapist. Dr. Eyad discusses the short and long term impact of war on the people, especially the children. This film shares some of the individual stories that were not covered by the mainstream media.  Asma Beseiso, a 25-year-old Jordanian filmmaker, could not believe what she saw on the news. Media coverage only told a small part of the story of what was happening in Gaza. Beseiso left Amman in February 2009 and headed to her parents’ hometown in Gaza a month after the Israeli bombardment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am Ghazzah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4337491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asma Beseiso","original_name":"Asma Beseiso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6537e9897fcab3010b009789","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
