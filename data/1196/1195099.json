She experienced the Second World War in Indonesia, was imprisoned in camps and left for the Netherlands after the war. Now she returns, perhaps for the last time, to the place where she grew up.  The young documentary maker Twan Spierts accompanied Joty to that historic place, where the first step was taken towards the independence of the Dutch East Indies. The documentary was previously broadcast on Omroep West.","popularity":0.2136,"poster_path":"/zgdCX3f1txmugsHLOqOUi6OtYea.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to Linggajati","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4335320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joty ter Kulve","original_name":"Joty ter Kulve","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3gpqM0qKi4vlX7pMoKV7REuhNQr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"653682588cfcc7014c8eab1b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Twan Spierts","original_name":"Twan Spierts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536827d2b2108011de05c4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/xfqGlOEFLJIPc7iaImsZXLZxCUN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/zgdCX3f1txmugsHLOqOUi6OtYea.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7348,"name":"indonesia"},{"id":214892,"name":"dutch east indies"},{"id":324151,"name":"linggarjati"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Back to Linggajati (English version) - documentary about Dutch history in Indonesia - Joty ter Kulve","key":"328vqH3kVgA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-12-21T22:05:46.000Z","id":"6536833491f0ea00fe1afd9d"}]}}}
