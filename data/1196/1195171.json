The revised storyline makes little sense, and there is a surprising amount of violence and sexual innuendo. However, the singers are superb, both vocally and in regard to their stage presence and acting, the orchestra plays beautifully, the chorus is wonderful, and the set is as clever as it is strange. It's definitely not for purists, or for someone new to this particular opera. But for someone who's seen Die Entfuhrung before, and is familiar enough with the original story to not miss it, watching Belmonte, Constanze, Blonde, Pedrillo, and Osmin embark on an entirely new adventure -- and push the boundaries of good taste -- is rather enjoyable.","popularity":0.1187,"poster_path":"/lEdevUZhPG3AU0yxTSnrMPz4ezl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2006-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Abduction from the Seraglio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Aikin","original_name":"Laura Aikin","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/62JXMsWISMD9YYbEglEn3lPGhDU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Konstanze","credit_id":"6536b41eabdafc014e7e8a4e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Castronovo","original_name":"Charles Castronovo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/kH3RqNqHPkwywWxysQLxw2Y3Vsb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Belmonte","credit_id":"6536b48542d83700ace23e9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3903532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Farcas","original_name":"Valentina Farcas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Blonde","credit_id":"6536b49cabdafc00acf8b912","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Hawlata","original_name":"Franz Hawlata","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Osmin","credit_id":"6536b4c14bc38b00acd4606a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Kerschbaum","original_name":"Dieter Kerschbaum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pedrillo","credit_id":"6536b4ce8cfcc7012b40c6c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivor Bolton","original_name":"Ivor Bolton","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/bdkL76voeiJzIMky1cEQWs8Klwp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6536b4f142d83700eac6dfb5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"6536b50d8cfcc7012b40c6d4","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3649855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomáš Šimerda","original_name":"Tomáš Šimerda","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536b539abdafc00acf8b941","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004402,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gottfried Pilz","original_name":"Gottfried Pilz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536b58b8cfcc700e96b3f25","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Herheim","original_name":"Stefan Herheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536b55dc14fee0100ea3e35","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l5En1BbsHbPqtp7I1OUEmkZzDdv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lEdevUZhPG3AU0yxTSnrMPz4ezl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
