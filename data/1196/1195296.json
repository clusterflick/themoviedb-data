Scattered moments from their everyday experiences in the outside world dissolve when everyone meets again in the safety of their chosen family. Scripted scenes merged with the authentic and lived experiences of the characters show how the ballroom culture intertwines with their lives & vice versa. The ballroom culture, which originated in the US in the late 1960s out of oppression and discrimination of African American and Latinx trans women, has always served as a space for freedom of self-expression and liberation for marginalized and queer people. The culture is still very much vibrant and alive today, in New York, Paris or all around the world. All of the dance, fashion, body & performance categories stem out of issues that queer, trans & BIPOC minorities had to face in the past and sadly a lot of them are still persistent in our societies even today - especially in the context of this region.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kQHSplSbINZE0nMSndiDBGaOR1j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Velvet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4336162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivana Hucikova","original_name":"Ivana Hucikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536ec504083b300ab9e5230","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3089367,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Igor Smitka","original_name":"Igor Smitka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536ec5e946318013ad6f9c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4336162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivana Hucikova","original_name":"Ivana Hucikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536ec8f946318011d095657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3089367,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Igor Smitka","original_name":"Igor Smitka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536ec981f748b00e2224432","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29078837","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kQHSplSbINZE0nMSndiDBGaOR1j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
