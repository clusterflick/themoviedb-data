Having recently buried his mother and now living alone on a violent, drug-infested block in Nashville, Tennessee, he forges an unlikely friendship with his next-door neighbor Eddie Cox, a blue-collar retiree and neighborhood busybody who couldn't be more different. In this cinéma-vérité exploration of blindness, fortitude, and friendship, Chuck reflects on wide-ranging subjects such as queer history, literature, and his own life, while struggling to face a very delicate surgery and its aftermath.","popularity":0.1761,"poster_path":"/s4LniAKmGZtSWuaBMG7vml6JyFn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Look Like Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4336549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Cox","original_name":"Eddie Cox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65374e50ae366800ada763c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4336550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Guy","original_name":"Chuck Guy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65374e5785b10500ae60d2c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Swafford","original_name":"Jeff Swafford","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65374e60ae366800ea9c260e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Moore","original_name":"Drew Moore","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/lovZsvnY7YjUMsIfHBba4dZ6sF9.jpg","credit_id":"65374e3aae366800ea9c25ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1938144,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Newberry","original_name":"James Newberry","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/9YWTOBrZH14EKyuiLodxqqDfN4K.jpg","credit_id":"6577d5e620ecaf00c699a5ae","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8819176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s4LniAKmGZtSWuaBMG7vml6JyFn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
