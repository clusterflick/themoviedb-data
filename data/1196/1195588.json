Tired, penniless, with a failing budget, he returns above all to rediscover part of what he suffers from having lost: the feelings, the enthusiasm, the memories of youth. Instead he finds many people willing to remain silent and some friends who escape him, like Mambretti. He finds, above all, a mysterious hint of death. In fact, he learns that five years earlier a friend of his, Count Luigi Ambrosi, was killed with a singular system. A cyanide egg. The investigations and the trial recognized a certain \"Panozzo\", administrator of Count Ambrosi, as the perpetrator of the crime, but the wife of the killed man continues to maintain that an innocent man was convicted.","popularity":0.1085,"poster_path":"/9Vf6aYAiCKSGysOvX51yBvRawYd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80445,"logo_path":null,"name":"SOAT","origin_country":""},{"id":28711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palumbo Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1975-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Curious Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Ferzetti","original_name":"Gabriele Ferzetti","popularity":0.6192,"profile_path":"/usiGcuBhMrSK8VnMHFKV6zDFrhj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Moriondo","credit_id":"6537a9ad94631800ad947116","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rada Rassimov","original_name":"Rada Rassimov","popularity":0.5321,"profile_path":"/xJhnSHn2vKp0MJ2KZaihrgqq0Mc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Contessa Lucia","credit_id":"6537a9bff495ee00c5164d4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaia Germani","original_name":"Gaia Germani","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/oKVjefi4g7nYQaSppHFxvwRtORo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Silvia","credit_id":"6537a9cf41aac400e040247f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4337015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Colombo","original_name":"Roberto Colombo","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Commissario","credit_id":"6537a9e7ae3668012c6697b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Fisichella","original_name":"Enzo Fisichella","popularity":0.2887,"profile_path":"/7f8A4VV75Gqfwg0IRilAfQMZcJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Borelli","credit_id":"6537a9ff41aac4011a7cc859","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":532144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tino Scotti","original_name":"Tino Scotti","popularity":0.2347,"profile_path":"/rtIRJ5pPJEpD7lvb6Ii81ORzcvL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mambretti","credit_id":"6537aa1941aac400c33221a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Mirani","original_name":"Massimo Mirani","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/n83yAFMp5039oiZkY3bWN3kI0ee.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Walter","credit_id":"6537aa2c7fcab3012c22f014","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":382758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezio Sancrotti","original_name":"Ezio Sancrotti","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/bADIbEJUxOuGdoVm9XkZ5jdLcSs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cavallotti","credit_id":"6537aa3b1f748b01048e9712","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dino B.
