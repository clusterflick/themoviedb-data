It also includes personal documents that belonged to the artist’s mother, her calendars and journals from the 70s, and an account of her death in 2011, which is the central piece and backbone of this work. Comprised of a fiction book, a video and a performance, it explores the intersections between literature and the visual arts. Between word and image, archive and fabulation, it reconfigures memories by using a nonlinear perception of time.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/y1ZLQAl2pyRi0YqZzkRfw2tOobB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water is a Time Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aline Motta","original_name":"Aline Motta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65388e24ae3668014da65008","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wK4ud7gzNbJXesaRbbT7u8ZzivT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":978,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1ZLQAl2pyRi0YqZzkRfw2tOobB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":652}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
