He then makes a play for the widow, who rebuffs him. To escape his arduous pursuit, she takes her little daughter on a trip but dies in an auto accident. The daughter is rescued but disappears. Her grandparents spend years looking for her, as does the executor who killed her father--if she's found she'll inherit the estate and he won't get a penny. He aims to see that she's never found, and if she is he plans to see that she doesn't live long enough to make a claim to the estate.","popularity":0.2964,"poster_path":"/aSUqXZEK6hVapqPVKep6pDy02pB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Midnight Alarm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1271535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Calhoun","original_name":"Alice Calhoun","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/sk6xhqK93Tynypj4yV09fCRBkn6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sparkle","credit_id":"6536be0891f0ea00ac5e3e90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1271535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Calhoun","original_name":"Alice Calhoun","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/sk6xhqK93Tynypj4yV09fCRBkn6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Thornton","credit_id":"6536be15c14fee011de8db87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percy Marmont","original_name":"Percy Marmont","popularity":0.2246,"profile_path":"/dCBC7q462B5aY64G8wlGlSSZYMd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Captain Harry Westmore","credit_id":"6536bec991f0ea00fe1b12f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cullen Landis","original_name":"Cullen Landis","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/zxYStYMxWtkGNWzfF9JPtMNMhtn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chaser","credit_id":"6536beda42d83700c940252f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Kilgour","original_name":"Joseph Kilgour","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/sBezq0JDRm4n3m5PxW54tDDEN2y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Silas Carrington","credit_id":"6536bef4abdafc014e7e8dd1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxine Elliott Hicks","original_name":"Maxine Elliott Hicks","popularity":0.121,"profile_path":"/bsx6w2p37aun27zIFbWY6lboMcb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aggie","credit_id":"6536bf0c8cfcc7012b40c9dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George C.
