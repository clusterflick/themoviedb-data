We follow her home on a pilgrimage, first to see her ambitious, academic boyfriend, Keith (Michael Sutherland), and then to the apartment lousy with ghosts where her older brother, Daniel (Kai Issey) is locked in an uneasy truce with their overbearing mother, Marcy (Rachel Marcus). Young Sophie and her brother grew up in a household run by vaudevillian actors who tended to believe that all problems could be remedied by a tangerine or a bowl of consecrated chicken soup. The two siblings could not find a better match than one another to share their woes, their spiritual and social alienation, their cross-bearing egotism and their insufferable superiority complexes. But Daniel, a bit older and wiser, has been in this game a few extra years, while Sophie is still just a grasshopper.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way of Glass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2339733","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
