In real-time digitizing sessions, people watch their own histories as they are being preserved, and reveal a look into queer life in the Bible Belt since the 1980s. ThisÂ film takes a road trip through the past into the present, and gives us a glimpse of what an ever-expanding queer archive looks like in the future.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tDrVTj2sbCqHHGdwPRI6kaBvlOV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Roaming Center for Magnetic Alternatives","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311929,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kendell Harbin","original_name":"Kendell Harbin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d91f99c5339eabc6365716","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brydie O'Connor","original_name":"Brydie O'Connor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91ef9ab259e03a7c6a7d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brydie O'Connor","original_name":"Brydie O'Connor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f00ab259e03a7c6a7d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brydie O'Connor","original_name":"Brydie O'Connor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f060af62258a93651c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Weiner","original_name":"Sean Weiner","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f223572af5bcc088331","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Weiner","original_name":"Sean Weiner","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f2ec5339eabc63656f4","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311929,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kendell Harbin","original_name":"Kendell Harbin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f363572af5bcc08833b","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444754,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martha Gregory","original_name":"Martha Gregory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f4bab259e03a7c6a7fb","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405910,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sarah Simka Jaffe","original_name":"Sarah Simka Jaffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f555f58e32f7e088c18","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Taul Katz","original_name":"Taul Katz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f673572af5bcc088342","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2751567,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arno Mokros","original_name":"Arno Mokros","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d91f79e1e3cdcbf9c6a768","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tDrVTj2sbCqHHGdwPRI6kaBvlOV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
