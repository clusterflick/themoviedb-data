Surrounded by concrete walls and barbed wire, from the outside it appears more like a prison than an asylum center. Here, up to 300 people at a time are waiting for their asylum decision. Their future depends on how the authorities judge their case. The film takes an in-depth look at this time of uncertainty. It lets the waiting people have their say and gives insight into this dreary and yet hopeful transitional phase with an uncertain outcome.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5312094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Jäggi","original_name":"Simon Jäggi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9440c1bb4b5c58bc6a53b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5312094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Jäggi","original_name":"Simon Jäggi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9442b5f58e32f7e089032","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5312094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Jäggi","original_name":"Simon Jäggi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9443ae1e3cdcbf9c6ad8e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
