The island is under the commandment of a local god called the \" Marshal Tie Jia,\" a frog deity. This deity originated from a temple on Wu-Yi Mountain in China, which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution when the deity migrated to Matsu. In Hsu's work, the island is used as a stage. Employing the cinematographic device of the \"green screen\" - a generic background replaced in the post-production process with any other background image - Hsu places a fictional version of the original tiny temple on the island, which has long since been replaced by a dilapidated bunker.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dqzuUGgcoMIWTydhynRSDSUrPEr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marshal Tie Jia – Turtle Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chia-Wei Hsu","original_name":"Chia-Wei Hsu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9da3db3b4f801040e8b08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqzuUGgcoMIWTydhynRSDSUrPEr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
