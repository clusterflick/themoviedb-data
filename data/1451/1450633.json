Her parents didn't like the fact that the one thing she loves is something far more challenging to accept in their religion. As her parents started disagreeing with her passion, she felt more trapped, as if her wings were being held, like she was being confined in a cage. Farasha is standing between a thin line on whether to keep going or stop since she doesn't have the right to live as per her choice. Farasha developed a disorder involving behavioral challenges that could harm her self-image. While battling her condition, Farasha tries to find her freedom to flight or fight in a situation where it was never an option.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wr25uGz79Vx0nhnUIUMCB3aF4DQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farasha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Ragudos","original_name":"Hannah Ragudos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9c4813d25468231d4b6a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wr25uGz79Vx0nhnUIUMCB3aF4DQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
