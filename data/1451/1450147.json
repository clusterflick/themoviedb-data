Is it possible to get to the source of the things we consume? In 2008, we came up with the idea to follow the reverse journey of a product. Our case was a tiny plastic electronic product, a pedometer. The sort of anonymous clutter that everyday life is full of. Something that just is. We wanted to follow the pedometer from the store in Stockholm where it was bought to the factory in China where it was manufactured. But how? We started by googling the word “logistics”. Four years later we found ourselves on the largest container ship in the world on our way from Sweden to China. We had started the journey by truck to Middle Sweden, then by freight train to the port of Gothenburg, and after four weeks at sea, we filmed from a truck again, this time from the port of Shenzhen to a factory in Bao´an.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":"/c20vlGw0ialotASdDkzliSLBsrO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tracking the global flow of products","title":"Logistics - 72 Minute Cut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1881539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erika Magnusson","original_name":"Erika Magnusson","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d86dbe814f677063f1574e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Andersson","original_name":"Daniel Andersson","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d86ddaebc30a0b480173a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A8BF8jgIF1QvNvjy5MKHjPoYlSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1362}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1063,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c20vlGw0ialotASdDkzliSLBsrO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
