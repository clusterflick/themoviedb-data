Seemingly 47,000 individual trees, it is unified by a single, immense root system, making it a ‘forest of one.’ Believed to be between 16,000 and 80,000 years old, Pando is the largest and heaviest known organism on land. Pando's invisible root system is a guiding metaphor that emphasizes the interconnectedness between humans and non-human beings, as well as the notion of Oneness described by many spiritual traditions.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Big Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5313660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sobia Ahmad","original_name":"Sobia Ahmad","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67da22a283d5f32a576c9ee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5313663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benny Shaffer","original_name":"Benny Shaffer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67da22beb05c8a380fa1e3d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
