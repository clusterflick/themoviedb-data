Six voices that have been silenced for years. ‘Polish Film About Abortion’ is not just a record of experiences – it is a cry that cannot be silenced. Pamela Porwen, known for her uncompromising activist photography, this time gives space to the protagonists, whose lives have become entangled in politics. In a raw, almost intimate form, the film interweaves the narratives of people from different backgrounds – a transgender man, a victim of sexual violence, an activist convicted of helping someone have an abortion – to create a brutally real picture of a reality in which decisions about one’s own body are a luxury available to few. There are no aesthetic filters or glamorous shots here – instead, there are emotions so thick you could cut them with a knife. Silence is no longer an option. This is a film that shocks, teases, opens your eyes, and doesn’t let you forget.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/q4tiuX95cj64UAyke31Z9C5SBMA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2025-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polish Film About Abortion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5314170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiktor Dynarski","original_name":"Wiktor Dynarski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67da6ff11741ed1f01a1f3c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Ratajczak","original_name":"Anna Ratajczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67da7019b05c8a380fa1ee76","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justyna Wydrzyńska","original_name":"Justyna Wydrzyńska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67da70292bea975f8da6d287","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarzyna Bierzanowska","original_name":"Katarzyna Bierzanowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67da70362bea975f8da6d291","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Parniewska","original_name":"Joanna Parniewska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67da704a1741ed1f01a1f402","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nastya Podorozhnya","original_name":"Nastya Podorozhnya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67da70651741ed1f01a1f41a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Porwen","original_name":"Pamela Porwen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67da6fbde8302533206ca9a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Porwen","original_name":"Pamela Porwen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67da6fc7b05c8a380fa1ee4d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Porwen","original_name":"Pamela Porwen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67da6fd11741ed1f01a1f3b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/q4tiuX95cj64UAyke31Z9C5SBMA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LGBT+ Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LGBT+ Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
