Many consider the Dutch willingness to transport themselves on a two wheeler as a something genetic inherited. In Together we cycle we have uncovered that it's a bit more complicated than that. Dutch cycling culture is the result of a social en spatial proces which was for the most un-intentional and mostly the result of other goals in public space like livability and safety for children. Dutch cycling culture therefor is not static. So, what will the future bring? This is the central question in the third part of the sequel which started out in 2017 with Why we cycle.  In the film When we cycle we will take a look into the great unknown. What are the different developments in society and what might be the role of the bike in these possible futures? Does the fast efficient cyclist get priority or are other scenarios conceivable? And how will that effect the city of the future?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When We Cycle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
