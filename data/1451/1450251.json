When her card is declined multiple times, her former college professor/mentor embarrassingly steps up to pay for them. The only thing the professor asks in return is that May share the ice cream (Peanut Butter Swirl) with her. The two then sit in the store's parking lot, eating ice cream (and having some whiskey) in the professor's SUV, and -- slowly -- the full truth of May's story comes out.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":"/yTtPjekBQbFhWx9S0xjGQAbr3I8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Alone during a crisis at Christmas, an ex-college student has ice cream and whiskey with her former professor.","title":"Peanut Butter Swirl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5327577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Driscoll","original_name":"Claire Driscoll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"May","credit_id":"67e2ef3c16a3c5c224f075c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5327579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Brock","original_name":"Lee Brock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Professor Bailey","credit_id":"67e2ef5da63bcc4997dc8576","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5327594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirae Ryu","original_name":"Mirae Ryu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Cashier","credit_id":"67e2f11aeba79f6ff7f09f1e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5327582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Feazel","original_name":"Emily Feazel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e2ef9516a3c5c224f075d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5327577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Driscoll","original_name":"Claire Driscoll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e2efa67b7313b5aef077d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802630,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William R.
