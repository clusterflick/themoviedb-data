It’s a tale of forgiveness, both on a national and personal level. The film seeks answers to what it means to be human and what our purpose here is. Based on Antti Tuuri’s novel Rauta-antura (The Iron Boot), the film offers a historically accurate portrayal. It follows the journey of a few individuals, told from their perspective, as they travel there and back.","popularity":0.1706,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146089,"logo_path":"/xfAG7NtOmk3wsssVB7ErT21dvRc.png","name":"Backmann & Hoderoff","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Lapland War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aku Louhimies","original_name":"Aku Louhimies","popularity":0.2419,"profile_path":"/5B7gYl40cURlqc4EkG0wgf1eplm.jpg","credit_id":"67d96e5c6a7b980436c6b8e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antti Tuuri","original_name":"Antti Tuuri","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d96e665f58e32f7e089e41","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antti Tuuri","original_name":"Antti Tuuri","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d96e816a7b980436c6b906","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aku Louhimies","original_name":"Aku Louhimies","popularity":0.2419,"profile_path":"/5B7gYl40cURlqc4EkG0wgf1eplm.jpg","credit_id":"67d96e8c0af62258a9365fc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Alén","original_name":"Andrei Alén","popularity":0.2094,"profile_path":"/ygt8hCr6K5jjwQBVUR0pe3JCDsj.jpg","credit_id":"67d96e98c0566a100a0891cd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aku Louhimies","original_name":"Aku Louhimies","popularity":0.2419,"profile_path":"/5B7gYl40cURlqc4EkG0wgf1eplm.jpg","credit_id":"67d96ea16a7b980436c6b926","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4415785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kiira Tiainen","original_name":"Kiira Tiainen","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d96eab0af62258a9365fd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937445,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mikko Tenhunen","original_name":"Mikko Tenhunen","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d96eb60af62258a9365fe6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":348731,"name":"lapland war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
