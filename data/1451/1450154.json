Near Coober Pedy is divided into three parts: \"Heat Waves\": camera fades combined with the heat flickers of the horizon; \"Horizon Play\": compositions of the horizon line within the frame; \"Fields of Vision\": a view from a moving vehicle exploring the tendencies of the flat landscape, revolving around a point on which the eye is fixed. The camera systematically scans the plain, which gets closer and closer, disappearing into the horizon.
