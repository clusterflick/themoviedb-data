Brian Bo, Bergur, Karsten and Jesper are all inmates in State Prison Vridsl√∏selille. They have each had their own criminal careers, but they have in common singing in the prison choir. Meeting with the charismatic choir director Louise Adrian, \"the bad boys with the soft voices\" are inspired to write their own songs. They become Fangekoret. Through the lyrics, they tell about their destinies, innermost thoughts and dreams. Fangekoret is a breather in an otherwise harsh and closed world. Even after their release, most prisoners continue in the choir, bravely singing their personal stories at concerts across the country. The music shows new paths and awakens the desire to give up the criminal career, but it is a long and tough process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prisoners' Choir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33452941","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
