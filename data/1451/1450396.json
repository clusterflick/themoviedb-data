However, before long, Kota disappears. When Yoshito finally manages to find him, he discovers that Kota has become disillusioned with reality and cryptically expresses his desire to “go somewhere else, anywhere but here.” Yoshito resonates with his words, and as their bond deepens, they delve further into Yoshito’s field of expertise—pessimism.  Together, they embark on an unusual cohabitation, finding a peculiar sense of enjoyment in their shared pessimism. But eventually, the worst tragedy imaginable befalls each of them.","popularity":0.4717,"poster_path":"/ApbexDOQiuvKYeaKOTggm0igEx1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Douse Shinunara, Paris de Shinou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amane Okayama","original_name":"岡山天音","popularity":0.5495,"profile_path":"/9lNQ9QZcgl81ydJ84veiJl4wK31.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67d9458d6a7b980436c6afac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2375373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yurito Mori","original_name":"Yurito Mori","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67d94597bb433951a73661c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eri Murakawa","original_name":"村川絵梨","popularity":0.5061,"profile_path":"/fqpRcXNCl27W9l9y4y2xyF4nFpv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67d9459fc24529be9208872d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozuno Nakamura","original_name":"中村織央","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/pXmHVdMhyP801KhvMofOxz2zN3h.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d945a81bb4b5c58bc6a54b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reiko Kataoka","original_name":"片岡礼子","popularity":0.6359,"profile_path":"/8V8JFYx0wFm8NCiAczX8t2RdXW0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67d945b0c24529be92088732","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3033164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oideyasu Oda","original_name":"おいでやす小田","popularity":0.1712,"profile_path":"/ohm5dxBGDuqCxnCuAeecTMJqqCO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67d945b6c24529be9208873d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5312101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuuchami","original_name":"Yuuchami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67d945c55f58e32f7e0890ab","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/ApbexDOQiuvKYeaKOTggm0igEx1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
