They follow their normal routines, similar yet different in many ways. Olive is an easygoing and less driven girl who hides her personality insecurities with her clothing. At the same time, Clementine is an ambitious and anxious girl who takes a lot of medication and stays busy to distract herself from all her anxieties. The two oddly find each other and can't shake the feeling from when they first spotted one another. When they continue to see each other, they realize there must be something between them.","popularity":0.9654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Oranges, Pears, And Buttons","title":"Girl/Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Troyer","original_name":"Claire Troyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Olive","credit_id":"67d8e59a5f58e32f7e087ffb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Coumounduros","original_name":"Zoe Coumounduros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Clementine","credit_id":"67d8e5b9e1e3cdcbf9c69d78","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roxanne Wilfert","original_name":"Roxanne Wilfert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d8e5cb0af62258a9364d6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roxanne Wilfert","original_name":"Roxanne Wilfert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d8e5dd5f58e32f7e08800b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roxanne Wilfert","original_name":"Roxanne Wilfert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d8e5eb6a7b980436c6a249","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roxanne Wilfert","original_name":"Roxanne Wilfert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d8e5f8c0566a100a087d28","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roxanne Wilfert","original_name":"Roxanne Wilfert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d8e6090af62258a9364d95","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197474,"name":"bonding"},{"id":251386,"name":"girlfriends"},{"id":315419,"name":"unique connection"},{"id":346871,"name":"lgbtq"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
