No outsider has ever remembered the truth, and over time, the townspeople have stopped trying to tell the world.  But when journalist Ruth stumbles into Windyville on a cross-country road trip, she, too, learns the town’s secret. Unlike those before her, she refuses to let it slip away. As she fights to hold onto what she’s discovered, one question remains: will she be the first to break free… or will she forget, just like everyone else?","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":256694,"logo_path":null,"name":"VAYLL","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"What would you do if you knew the exact date and time you were going to die?","title":"Windyville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5313428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Dale Barker","original_name":"Dusty Dale Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cary","credit_id":"67d9f9bb51163350da914453","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wyatt Earp","original_name":"Wyatt Earp","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/hqyq9AsDIj1Ej9t5UT7Bof3i5e4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ray","credit_id":"67d9f9c651163350da91445f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Alsaleh","original_name":"Ali Alsaleh","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"John","credit_id":"67d9f9d2fb3ecf08b2ddb364","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Wolfe","original_name":"Ashley Wolfe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1oEqbZ6lE43ubN9ktwWrIRLKFTa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"67d9f9de51163350da914482","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5313430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skylar Spisak","original_name":"Skylar Spisak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"67d9f9ead2bbe0f926064be2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5313428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Dale Barker","original_name":"Dusty Dale Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9f9abd2bbe0f926064bb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27954640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
