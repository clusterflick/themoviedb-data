The animals in the forest like her, because she has never caused anyone suffering. But she has a small mistake: sometimes greed overcomes her - so also on a Christmas evening. She wants more gifts than she deserves, so Santa decides not to give her a gift at all this year. The witch chases after Santa's balloon to tear him a gift. But she does not succeed, instead her witch broom breaks during the wild hunt.  Sadly, the witch sneaks home. Unhappy and lonely, she sits in her gloomy witch apartment and is ashamed of her greedy behavior. Suddenly Santa is standing in front of her. He is not evil, but gives her a new witch broom and a red witch cat.  So it happens that Hex' and Santa celebrate Christmas together and make music deep into the night.","popularity":0.1732,"poster_path":"/nibg4b978oyh5dqhjwGwxnuKt6H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78931,"logo_path":null,"name":"UAP Video GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1994-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Weihnachtsmärchen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Un Conte de Noël","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","title":"Božić male vještice","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Hexe und der Weihnachtsmann - Ein Weihnachtsmärchen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Stützner","original_name":"Lutz Stützner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dac330e54e922d726cbc3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandor Jesse","original_name":"Sandor Jesse","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dac340c536af65bba6d08a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314577,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Heike Baumann","original_name":"Heike Baumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dac46f83d5f32a576cb250","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642467,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Oszkár Hernádi","original_name":"Oszkár Hernádi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dac484c536af65bba6d119","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dejan Rakas","original_name":"Dejan Rakas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dac49f1741ed1f01a20430","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Stützner","original_name":"Lutz Stützner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dac4b3e8302533206cb245","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1145485","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nibg4b978oyh5dqhjwGwxnuKt6H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":624}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":616,"name":"witch"},{"id":1991,"name":"santa claus"},{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
