It looks south west across Grosvenor Place. The southern wing of St George's Hospital (today the Lanesborough Hotel) can be seen on the right of the picture. The road stretching away in the centre of the picture is Grosvenor Crescent.  The busy two way horsedrawn traffic movement is seen on what would today be Grosvenor Place and Apsley Way (the road layout now is different to 1896). The approximate camera position would be today on Apsley Way, just east of the Royal Artillery Memorial. Not to be confused with another Hyde Park Corner film by British Path√© made in the same year but with a different view. (That film looks north towards the triumphal arch at the corner of Hyde Park next to Apsley House.)","popularity":0.3483,"poster_path":"/w0jlyhlaIrnDvAM06foPSdOqY27.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1896-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyde Park Corner","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w0jlyhlaIrnDvAM06foPSdOqY27.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207928,"name":"19th century"},{"id":282996,"name":"street"},{"id":305021,"name":"1890s"},{"id":330504,"name":"horse-drawn"},{"id":334475,"name":"actuality"},{"id":334791,"name":"lanesborough hotel"},{"id":334792,"name":"st george's hospital"},{"id":334909,"name":"grosvenor place"},{"id":334910,"name":"london transport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1896-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
