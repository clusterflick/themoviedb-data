They enter a flat and open the ice-box, from which they steal a large cheese. They are caught as they attempt to escape and brought before court, where the judge decides that the cheese should be divided equally. The court clerk, attracted by the aroma and his appetite, eats part of the cheese and passes around the remainder. The moral brought out by this cartoon is that it is expensive to quarrel.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cats at Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Terry","original_name":"Paul Terry","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/9nUH3iMaImOynJyXfo11Hp8b4q4.jpg","credit_id":"6691c213b71c4fbbeb02385e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0402898","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
