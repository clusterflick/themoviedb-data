Since 1987, Ohio has had breed specific laws embedded in their ordinance that declares Pit Bulls inherently vicious, and places them in the same category with dogs that have actually bitten or attacked another person or animal. Thousands of innocent dogs are killed every year from the houses of perfectly healthy family pets due to this law. The question remains, 'Do we have a dangerous dog breed problem, or just dangerous laws targeting dogs?'","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/38eL3r1xBCXJJ5NvrDtrwuI5ubp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary film about putting an end to Breed Discrimination","title":"Guilty Til Proven Innocent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2413560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/38eL3r1xBCXJJ5NvrDtrwuI5ubp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1992}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
