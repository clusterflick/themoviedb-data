Two women, physically apart but emotionally connected, express their melancholy through a traditional Ukrainian song. The animation, inspired by Ukrainian folk art, vividly portrays their struggles. As the ancient melody unfolds, it serves as a universal language, bridging the gap between the characters. The animation transitions between the women's worlds - Ukrainian and Latvian village women, emphasizing the universal nature of human emotions.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/qdNa2IY1jFFIzj21Tv2vul9dVor.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalyna Malyna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauline Zapolska","original_name":"Pauline Zapolska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6693d149bc8de03b5fa7bcd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32909084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qdNa2IY1jFFIzj21Tv2vul9dVor.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian Edition","release_date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Linoleum International Contemporary Animation and Media Art Festival","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Edition","release_date":"2024-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2023-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
