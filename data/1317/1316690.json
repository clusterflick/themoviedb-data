Then, another exchange program begins.  The name of their partner school is Romana Drama School.  It is a newly established school that was founded five years ago. With the rumors of them snatching up excellent students from exchange programs, they possess a shady history.  The play Romana has chosen is Oscar Wilde's \"Salome\", which was once banned due to its content being deemed radical and degenerate.  To play Salome, one must steal others' brilliance and be a pure egoist with infinite desires.  Appearing before the bewildered Stella is none other than Mikoto Aragami,  her old rival from her time in Munich, Germany...  \"Stella Takachiho. I will steal everything from you, and play Salome.\"","popularity":0.441,"poster_path":"/iysUAg7tZRv9IMsi5QkT4NjzS7v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42196,"logo_path":"/nQNmHvcmaT0zk1Rf0TYtLYO5MpI.png","name":"Bushiroad","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2024-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revue
