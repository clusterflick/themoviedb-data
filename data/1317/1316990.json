When a gentlemanly neighbor makes romantic advances to her, she wishes her husband dead. Sooner than she hoped, her wish comes true—when her husband dies in a mining accident.  When Charles Holroyd's body is brought home from the mine, and his wife and mother must wash him and lay him out for his funeral, we see for the first time the other side of the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Holroyd—now, when it's too late.","popularity":0.9859,"poster_path":"/xezhP4m9iLblOb3E9uaZxdGMYUm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39477,"logo_path":"/hfXGuDnuVFOYJVfw83fJvGUtt5O.png","name":"KQED","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"},{"id":233891,"logo_path":null,"name":"Long Wharf Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4830028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emery Battis","original_name":"Emery Battis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rigley","credit_id":"6694624b75e62792205f378c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Castang","original_name":"Veronica Castang","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"6694625ea20579b520a7c161","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Converse","original_name":"Frank Converse","popularity":0.4375,"profile_path":"/26AEW0IXkiGVzjsptaO8WywP7LQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Blackmore","credit_id":"6694626d73ff6d6eddf48374","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1833242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Ebert","original_name":"Joyce Ebert","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Holroyd","credit_id":"6694627dff028427d76b1f56","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Fitzgerald","original_name":"Geraldine Fitzgerald","popularity":0.515,"profile_path":"/jLpd1AxJIAYHE41kIJjXKAK5Vnn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"6694629fb914b04a4f5f3828","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4830030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicky Geyer","original_name":"Vicky Geyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Minnie Holroyd","credit_id":"669462aabbaaff2abb97a471","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Maxwell","original_name":"Roberta Maxwell","popularity":0.3297,"profile_path":"/ejMmpGmtr2FbLWdSZqhMzXKJ0bG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Clara","credit_id":"669462b9d77d4269c85f378f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3171132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Ousey","original_name":"Timothy Ousey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jack Holroyd","credit_id":"669462c9bf77fdbffc97a464","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Robbins","original_name":"Rex Robbins","popularity":0.2865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Holroyd","credit_id":"669462de0053f970c8896bcf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1672217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Swetland","original_name":"William Swetland","popularity":0.2218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mine manager","credit_id":"669462ee12dcaa9c4465d978","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arvin Brown","original_name":"Arvin Brown","popularity":0.2552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6694621527501d1f22ba9616","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John J.
