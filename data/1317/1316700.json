By day, he works as a construction worker in Windsor, Ontario, and by night, he makes films. His latest project involves chronicling the rise and fall of the Hi Ho Restaurants, founded by his grandfather Amie Fortin. Marshall's uncles, initially supportive, begin to resist as he delves into the darker aspects of their family history. With his project unravelling, Marshall finds solace in visits with his grandmother. Filmmaker Matt Gallagher documents this journey, blurring the line between truth and fiction.","popularity":0.123,"poster_path":"/khndaAHDvE7jtmZWWfdCscF6tkY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75168,"logo_path":"/7QhlWdkgNchV1XK194QTbFNGy6v.png","name":"TVO","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One man's search for the half-truth.","title":"The Rise and Fall of the Grumpy Burger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4828559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Sfalcin","original_name":"Marshall Sfalcin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66934bcd5f6b453812ad40d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4828560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Sfalcin","original_name":"Christian Sfalcin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66934bd85bd53f9c7ce4f99d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4828561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Wells","original_name":"Phillip Wells","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66934be0cf9c76ec79b2ab28","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Gallagher","original_name":"Matt Gallagher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66934c398a130e8d7c13335e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498513,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Hector","original_name":"Nick Hector","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/gtgBIbIU01FfEduOI0y1TRlnLN2.jpg","credit_id":"66934d1682223ab808e4f8cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Gallagher","original_name":"Matt Gallagher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66934ce5420d8f11f07e314a","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4828573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Friedman","original_name":"Steve Friedman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66934e92defb3af6fb1e64b0","department":"Production","job":"Accountant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4828569,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Bonini","original_name":"Michael Bonini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66934d57f1ce3b5bb2b2a830","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543537,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Allcock","original_name":"Michael Allcock","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/jp8ysC8pFxfc59ivdlrZlXQQsiA.jpg","credit_id":"66935b6e7308b50d9c9c5ff3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1541911","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1053,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/khndaAHDvE7jtmZWWfdCscF6tkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":["Nudity"],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Rise and Fall of the Grumpy Burger","key":"46844748","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-08-02T21:50:34.000Z","id":"66934b66b0543f9df488cba0"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Rise and Fall of the Grumpy Burger","key":"06N3LfOvteM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-06-14T19:28:10.000Z","id":"66934b88d5fcee4c767e2d11"}]}}}
