Survival is a daily and all-consuming struggle that is thinly forged from an inclement sea and pushed to the edge of the land by merciless feudal landowners. But it is Morag's passionate relationship with John Tullock, who is unwittingly pledged to marry Sinéad, that threatens to tear the community apart.","popularity":1.2688,"poster_path":"/uqnmeDidqTYW9V2vnCJ8XlTsLW6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":738,"logo_path":"/bLBdowsgMoipjXLi9QpdcZOvPhG.png","name":"Myriad Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":101380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galleon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Storm Witch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gemma Arterton","original_name":"Gemma Arterton","popularity":3.9862,"profile_path":"/Alfm28oyHNiYweNCUaMmrVjVMAT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Morag","credit_id":"66915638e985c04865ee4b06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1125581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloe Pirrie","original_name":"Chloe Pirrie","popularity":0.5262,"profile_path":"/t5pUoG5kDk8F0uNQ1reMD8Cd4V0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sinéad","credit_id":"6691565e82dd04ebac2cdcf7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Martin","original_name":"Stuart Martin","popularity":0.757,"profile_path":"/qSM4nGc1FyxygdG9YyU4uritqn2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Tullock","credit_id":"66915689e9ce95b94706b5e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Dickie","original_name":"Kate Dickie","popularity":0.6524,"profile_path":"/mlFYUmZycpRa7TGgDTfP0xanE1Q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6691569d8a77a1a8714cfc71","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Cree","original_name":"Steven Cree","popularity":0.4749,"profile_path":"/oH9uSQMJPdFHeVggqvMwheW7nZl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"669156c19e53b99a32cace70","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin McKidd","original_name":"Kevin McKidd","popularity":1.0195,"profile_path":"/KtmEKOSehmQ35JfGjEjpqlypbP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"669156d1b0cd83641b23a168","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wallace","original_name":"Michael Wallace","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/v9kSDNmdrqocYNsngm98jdgCE5r.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fergus Rendell","credit_id":"66915762c5f850f19180992d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Blair","original_name":"David Blair","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66915c0e82a6c1d6d623a093","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tristan de Vere Cole","original_name":"Tristan de Vere Cole","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66915c1c4ecdc2aefeee4a91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673959,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alice de Sousa","original_name":"Alice de Sousa","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66915cc9158a4bc768811e1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61075,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kirk D'Amico","original_name":"Kirk D'Amico","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66915cdcbf0d539d59d9a1ce","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1874644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andres Jauernick","original_name":"Andres Jauernick","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66915cefa8e53f1ac89e2708","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Blair","original_name":"David Blair","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66915cfdbed15a1967cc9cd9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14101406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1710,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqnmeDidqTYW9V2vnCJ8XlTsLW6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":616,"name":"witch"},{"id":207941,"name":"17th century"},{"id":328590,"name":"witches"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
