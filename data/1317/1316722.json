'Foster Shock' examines Florida's 'privatized' foster care system. It explains the Community Based Care (CBC) concept: how CBC's were designed to work for the child's benefit and why they are off course. 'Foster Shock' examines the massive amounts of taxpayer dollars being spent with little oversight and accountability, in addition, how this has lead to an over reliance on group homes, many of which are for profit. Through personal stories told by former foster youth, this film allows the audience an opportunity to hear heart wrenching accounts of how Florida has failed its children. 'Foster Shock' also shares interviews with Florida's professional experts in child welfare. This film also showcases a Florida CBC that has shown measurable success in child placement, staff turnover and permanency.","popularity":0.2469,"poster_path":"/eyMMoyVqNeVF3ddO7LSe17eGpUa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Failing Florida's children","title":"Foster Shock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4828751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mari Frankel","original_name":"Mari Frankel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66937866bc83b9a0fbb2ae7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5205070","wikidata_id":"Q26898711","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eyMMoyVqNeVF3ddO7LSe17eGpUa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1166}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":516,"name":"child abuse"},{"id":208400,"name":"foster care"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
