Derek Johnstone leapt straight into football's history books at the tender age of 16 when he was the youngest player ever to score a winning goal in a national final. That was at Hampden, October 24, 1970, the League Cup, which Rangers won against Celtic was the prize.  The 1970s was Derek's golden era. He won a European medal in 1972 in Barcelona, the treble in 1976 and was Rangers top goalscorer. He won another treble in 1978. All of these achievements made him a Rangers legend.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/t3gPgImJBV9d5j4tPVpCPxiqMqI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125837,"logo_path":"/w7LnFwCe068TBJbOGkRNNyfYJSo.png","name":"John Williams Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Derek Johnstone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3542654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Johnstone","original_name":"Derek Johnstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66945144288eca90115315cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandy Jardine","original_name":"Sandy Jardine","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6694539bdceadada3ea7c14e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3542652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Greig","original_name":"John Greig","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669453a5a20579b520a7c0b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Johnston","original_name":"Willie Johnston","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669453be96514bb9f01cca0f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4830000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jock Wallace","original_name":"Jock Wallace","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - (archive)","credit_id":"66945d0d25235fd5835f37d1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3309708,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Williams","original_name":"John Williams","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6694518ea015bf85091cc5e1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t3gPgImJBV9d5j4tPVpCPxiqMqI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
