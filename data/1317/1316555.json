Gilmour's commitment to West Auckland saw him do two years as a Waitakere city councillor, and run for mayor of Auckland. In this special tribute, colleagues from comedy and politics reflect on the authenticity, focus and skill that lay behind his public image. There are also stand-up highlights from Gilmour’s many years on stage, ranging from raw early sets to a seemingly effortless final gig in October 2014, the night before he died.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ewen Gilmour: Westie Legend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
