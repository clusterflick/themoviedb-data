It was here in 1942 that the United states and Japan fought the greatest naval battle of all time, and changed the course of World War II. Join Titanic discoverer Dr. Robert Ballard as he, a team of experts, and four World War II veterans return to Midway to do the impossible: to locate at least one of the five downed aircraft carriers, including the U.S.S Yorktown. Hear the amazing accounts of the four men who narrowly escaped with their lives, and watch as they pay their final respects to their fallen comrades three miles below the waters of Midway.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/MCbRRq90ds2jdm8m0pSFyyG7QD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle for Midway","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0940582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/MCbRRq90ds2jdm8m0pSFyyG7QD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1426,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2vsbMnSmP8Ww1iQ5tsF3yhQirO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
