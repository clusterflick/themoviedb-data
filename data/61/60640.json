First-time director Barb Lee goes deep into the intimate lives of two well-meaning families and shows us the subtle challenges they face. One family is just beginning the process of adopting a baby from China and is filled with hope and possibility. The other family’s adopted Korean daughter is now 32 years old. Prompted by her adoptive mother’s terminal illness, she tries to create the bond they never had. The results are riveting, unpredictable and telling. While the two families are at opposite ends of the journey, their stories converge to show us that love isn’t always enough.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An intimate view of the complications of international adoption through the eyes of two adoptive families.","title":"Adopted","video":false,"vote_average":6.833,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812656,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Flavia de Souza","original_name":"Flavia de Souza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62355649df294500460160d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2658028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nancy Kim Parsons","original_name":"Nancy Kim Parsons","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623556c7fea0d7004589bb87","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781502,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marsha Kahm","original_name":"Marsha Kahm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62355628fea0d70079e1dfe1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3471020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Butin","original_name":"Ben Butin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623556171da7a600775ab739","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3471022,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lindsey Boullt","original_name":"Lindsey Boullt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6235569edb72c000743b66d0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alston Gardner","original_name":"Alston Gardner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e0834c3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barb Lee","original_name":"Barb Lee","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e0834bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1446819","wikidata_id":"Q20030136","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
