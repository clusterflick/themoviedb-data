What follows is a situation that spirals out of control. In a frenzy to find an American husband before her visa expires, Sophia manipulates poor Marsha and David into caring for her ten-year-old daughter while she goes on a dating marathon. Pretty soon, who is employing whom, becomes the question. Also thrown into the mix are Marsha's hypochondriac father, Sophia's eccentric Mama and cousin Sasha from the Moscow circus.","popularity":0.9621,"poster_path":"/tZkVXihSl2l733OmBqaqMuvslRB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domestic Import","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nanny Insanity","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":156106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Dorf","original_name":"Larry Dorf","popularity":0.2363,"profile_path":"/h5XRyOhIt7mHIuJwi7newbgdNr4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David McMillian","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e0812ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alla Korot","original_name":"Alla Korot","popularity":0.3442,"profile_path":"/weP50vM8jF4vS2Npnpajt014MTz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sophia Petrenko","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e081303","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1213299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Preston","original_name":"Cynthia Preston","popularity":0.6171,"profile_path":"/2VULbq0fIhsvV5LmrOqkYY3GJ8v.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marsha McMillan","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e081307","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mindy Sterling","original_name":"Mindy Sterling","popularity":0.4687,"profile_path":"/hX99KTTCFxB4a2rB1SpDbr8imrK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bernice Kimmelman","credit_id":"62875e1e6c84920050b2fe04","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Riehle","original_name":"Richard Riehle","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/wgjBsgpzRvardVXZhNGixSw63g2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sam the Mailman","credit_id":"62875e3a209f1812c62a5feb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roddy Piper","original_name":"Roddy Piper","popularity":0.8316,"profile_path":"/3LZvHroOYjUe8mKP3AWL87ML8d7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bronco Bill","credit_id":"62875e4e209f1812c62a5ffa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Connor","original_name":"Kevin Connor","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/mG2WJt0UgxKYqErBx1BgAcYuKuD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e0812fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0762091","wikidata_id":"Q5290158","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tZkVXihSl2l733OmBqaqMuvslRB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
