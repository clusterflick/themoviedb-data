It witnesses the rise and fall of one family of entrepreneurs, the Kuukkanen family from Salla, Lapland, side-by-side with the current changes in the values of our society. In combining private and personal family memories with ongoing changes in the scenery, the documentary asks: How to avoid irreversible changes in the nature when earning your living?  Selling the Silence is a journey to the North, past and present. Sometimes the journey can be surprising, sometimes sad, sometimes absurd in a black Finnish way. When the film asks: ”What is the price of the wilderness?”, it is also a question of identity: Who you really are? What is your real nature?","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/bOXLbcCbDTsPS5yz60IePxkKwRZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmimaa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do you know what is happening in Lapland?","title":"Salla - Selling the Silence","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Salla - Ausverkauf der Stille","type":"TV"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jyrki Kuukkanen","original_name":"Jyrki Kuukkanen","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18dbadaf57c01859dd17e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kari Väyrynen","original_name":"Kari Väyrynen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18dc86c449c0149f967b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3574673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erkka Parkkinen","original_name":"Erkka Parkkinen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18dd8daf57c01629c13b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Hulkko","original_name":"Henry Hulkko","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18de2a806730184aaf61c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markku Kankaanranta","original_name":"Markku Kankaanranta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18dec2d531a0185c1e8d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3639903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aarne Aatsinki","original_name":"Aarne Aatsinki","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18df741a561016382ec6f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ville Aho","original_name":"Ville Aho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18e0f9dee58017c7dee29","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Mänty","original_name":"Maria Mänty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18e1ea39d0b0149079c60","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pirjo Tolonen","original_name":"Pirjo Tolonen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18e2707e281017cdeaab0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4566224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piritta Kuukkanen","original_name":"Piritta Kuukkanen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1013,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e18e30a284eb014bd43448","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232105,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markku Tuurna","original_name":"Markku Tuurna","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4640c3a368484e0866d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tarja Kylmä","original_name":"Tarja Kylmä","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4640c3a368484e0866d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232105,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markku Tuurna","original_name":"Markku Tuurna","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4640c3a368484e0866dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1587848","wikidata_id":"Q106975894","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6bMHBqv5rJXLWdikEgKGu8hlePm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bOXLbcCbDTsPS5yz60IePxkKwRZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2806,"name":"lapland"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"S","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
