Through interviews with former FBI Profilers, Cultural Academics, and Film Historians the documentary delves into the disturbing history and myth of Snuff Films. The FBI claims there is no evidence to prove the existence of Snuff and, therefore, Snuff Films are a myth. This documentary analyzes the relationships between war, cult films, serial killers and pornography to prove whether or not this pervasive myth is, in fact, reality.","popularity":0.3152,"poster_path":"/huUEQAjCBOV33hkIxOlbxKdhp3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ever seen a Snuff Film?","title":"Snuff: A Documentary About Killing on Camera","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry C.
