He dominated the 2008 season, proving his skills in all conditions and on every terrain. Loeb wasn't the only record-breaker: Title rival Mikko Hirvonen, who headed the Championship battle early in the season. Ford team-mate Jari-Matti Latvala also claimed his place in history when he became the youngest person ever to win a WRC event.","popularity":0.2285,"poster_path":"/beMwyjvZrIyIiB2lo7Q9nYjmJjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Marketing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WRC 2008 - FIA World Rally Championship","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/beMwyjvZrIyIiB2lo7Q9nYjmJjt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":224325,"name":"rallying"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
