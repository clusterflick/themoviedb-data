This feature-length documentary delves into the lives of three aspiring Hollywood screenwriters as they pour their hearts into their spec scripts, pitch their ideas to anyone who will listen, go to meetings, hold table reads, and work at low-level day-jobs - all in the hopes of one day seeing one of their beloved creations made into a movie. These poignant portraits are intercut with wisdom from a \"Greek Chorus\" of superstar Hollywood creative-types like James L. Brooks, Nora Ephron, Gary Ross, and Carrie Fisher to forge a funny and compelling look at inspiration, creativity, and solitude in the movie industry.","popularity":1.1388,"poster_path":"/tPLkJJNc8li420GjMO5kmzJvnEp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary about screenwriters for dreamers everywhere.","title":"Dreams on Spec","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2361895,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Aaron","original_name":"Joe Aaron","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/2aqFqHde43HNowGaEt1A1cYuT3o.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d2b7c4f4b9bae11155a107d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Goodwin","original_name":"Deborah Goodwin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d2b7c63a294f00012338d3c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David J.
