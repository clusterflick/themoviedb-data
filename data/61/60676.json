Filmmaker Daniel Bitton follows Willis throughout the Chicago area, riding the bus, talking to friends and strangers alike, selling his CDs to record shops, and going about his day. Willis was memorable to many for being schizophrenic as well as 6'6\" and over 300 pounds but was loved by his fans and friends for his quirky, oddball music, artistic talent, and for being a real gentle giant. He was a testament to the human drive to survive and create, as he himself was a survivor of extreme poverty, mental illness, child abuse, racism, and obesity. The fact that he lived to see 40 was incredible, but his having a successful music career and being able to function was even more so.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/fKsQSwWHEG8BX1O7yCfVAeQyixN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wesley Willis: The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wesley Willis","original_name":"Wesley Willis","popularity":0.1295,"profile_path":"/dD2u9w7BgMWLxEBjcH1U14kdQmL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4630c3a368484e083a17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Albini","original_name":"Steve Albini","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":"/zI9YFNPOdKMEKPraDiM4ygVPMmN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4630c3a368484e083a1b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":320719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Bitton","original_name":"Daniel Bitton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4630c3a368484e083a13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wesley Willis","original_name":"Wesley Willis","popularity":0.1295,"profile_path":"/dD2u9w7BgMWLxEBjcH1U14kdQmL.jpg","credit_id":"60010ed66d97e6003d19d448","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0387682","wikidata_id":"Q7728602","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fKsQSwWHEG8BX1O7yCfVAeQyixN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":683},{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/advNHRvwu7LJ2ijgpaul8WwGT9R.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
