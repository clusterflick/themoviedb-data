There are now approximately 70,000 Chinese adoptees being raised in the United States. Ninety-five percent of them are girls. Each year, these girls face new questions regarding their adopted lives and surroundings. This is a film about Chinese adopted girls, their American adoptive families and the paradoxical losses and gains inherent in international adoption. The characters and events in this story will challenge our traditional notions of family, culture and race.","popularity":0.5573,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wo Ai Ni Mommy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wo Ai Ni (I Love You) Mommy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1484585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Wang-Breal","original_name":"Stephanie Wang-Breal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42ab9e99d5c30033b87c4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Helfand","original_name":"Judith Helfand","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42abf66eecee003653668d","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1484585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Wang-Breal","original_name":"Stephanie Wang-Breal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42abb3e860170035563cdd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777324,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gigi Wong","original_name":"Gigi Wong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42abbd41a5610034ccba4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752792,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Goldman","original_name":"Paul Goldman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42ac6d41a5610031cc204a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1314393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ursula Liang","original_name":"Ursula Liang","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42ac0f0bb0760032d7afc9","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carrie Weprin","original_name":"Carrie Weprin","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42ac3341a5610034ccbb35","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1483716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean Tsien","original_name":"錢孝貞","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/abqgbKRwcLsRj3RPKnyQJsIIliD.jpg","credit_id":"5f42ac27477215003362d42e","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1484585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Wang-Breal","original_name":"Stephanie Wang-Breal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42abdc6eecee0036536681","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1509284","wikidata_id":"Q8028940","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2393,"name":"adoption"},{"id":179468,"name":"interracial adoption"},{"id":179485,"name":"chinese american"},{"id":185927,"name":"adopted child"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":228163,"name":"adopted daughter"},{"id":229884,"name":"adoptive parent"},{"id":231520,"name":"international adoption"},{"id":238631,"name":"chinese girl"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wo Ai Ni Mommy Trailer","key":"ipMtH5zDf8I","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-03-01T20:50:12.000Z","id":"5f42ae57e8601700365673e8"}]}}}
