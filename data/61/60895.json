She has some personal prejudicial hurdles to cross before she is able to be a true teacher for these children and of course there are hurdles like the lack of books and supplies.","popularity":4.3532,"poster_path":"/alz6CH9i5EmQJhlT5qLKGOq8YdL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9027,"logo_path":"/eGT7RxXHIyhByHpZmv4WxBwoWAl.png","name":"Hallmark Hall of Fame
