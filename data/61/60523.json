Soon after his wife and daughter leave him, he receives word his little girl has been injured in a car accident outside Chicago. His wife will call later with news, but Billâ€™s short the $53 he needs to keep his phone from being disconnected. Filled with anguish, he heads out onto the Los Angeles streets to find some way to come up with the cash. As his character encounters expected cruelty and unexpected kindness, Duryea takes what might have been mere melodrama and turns it into a perceptive examination of one shattered soul. The other fine star of this race-against-the-clock programmer is an unglamorous, lunch-bucket L.A. rarely captured on film.","popularity":0.7924,"poster_path":"/vQWqit76iffRMfNfXjamsSIjDzL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arrowhead Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"$53 means life or death to him!","title":"Chicago Calling","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Duryea","original_name":"Dan Duryea","popularity":0.3721,"profile_path":"/tfX2o7EBXRbJhCrVKnSfvfPSG0K.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Cannon","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081fdb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Anderson","original_name":"Mary Anderson","popularity":0.1654,"profile_path":"/f1WzqnpBUektFZH5LiMVbiTb892.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Cannon","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081fdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Gebert","original_name":"Gordon Gebert","popularity":0.2531,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bobby","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081fe3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Elliott","original_name":"Ross Elliott","popularity":0.2941,"profile_path":"/f7IMm8AhhbYauIqm1KEr4IHfZCu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081fe7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1069762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Casey","original_name":"Melinda Casey","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/4vOiHxKlJQafzpsWy7bYQQUEal1.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Nancy Cannon","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081feb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Brubaker","original_name":"Judy Brubaker","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Babs Kimball","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081fef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Mae Jones","original_name":"Marcia Mae Jones","popularity":0.3972,"profile_path":"/aerwDgFl6UiFcYO0FZVNh3cJY1O.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Peggy (as Marsha Jones)","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081ff3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marsha Jones","original_name":"Marsha Jones","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Peggy","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081ff7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Engel","original_name":"Roy Engel","popularity":0.4108,"profile_path":"/i5AvkOVO5LhU8JNjWO6BAg9CowG.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"52fe4629c3a368484e081ffb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Harvey","original_name":"Jean Harvey","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Christine","credit_id":"660004567f6c8d017c71f298","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Pendleton","original_name":"Steve Pendleton","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/o8VCARJgaUxQbqs3IMKL2TC7gFE.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Police Lt.
