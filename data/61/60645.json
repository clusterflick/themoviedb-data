Starting from their mid-60's garage band roots (sounding amazingly like the Sonics), the Motor City 5 deveoped into an icon for a brand of loud, crushing music reflecting their industrial roots. Even if you don't care for their music (and you're bound to like even a few of their songs), their story is fascinating. It combines 60's protest, youthful braggadocio, and a style of music that would help carry one to the likes of Iggy and the Stooges (not to mention certain aspects of punk rock). This film is clearly a labor of love, combining extraordinarily rare live shows, still shots, a nearly-continuous backdrop of MC5 tunes, penetrating interviews with the remaining members and their spouses, and even FBI surveillance shots. It's the ultimate testimonial to a band that only gains in stature as time goes on.","popularity":0.3784,"poster_path":"/4xGZ5B8eQ9HDthOeFkJFtl7tgSb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MC5: A True Testimonial","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Tyner","original_name":"Rob Tyner","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/5VHkolSOR0MeIhLZSlWPstvPYEm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e083547","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Kramer","original_name":"Wayne Kramer","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/xCfop9mwvUTpTCVKSNdTSzcTgL8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e08354b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred 'Sonic' Smith","original_name":"Fred 'Sonic' Smith","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/nFIQQ6aZCiBG4VzYxJOwy34Gh3e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e08354f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Davis","original_name":"Michael Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/a9Bws4ikIgcHSXdbIfP048ySmH6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e083553","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Thompson","original_name":"Dennis Thompson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/wDBht2CXtbDtaAFRzluQjKkqD6W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e083557","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sinclair","original_name":"John Sinclair","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe462fc3a368484e08355b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373071,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David C.
