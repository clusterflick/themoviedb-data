Life goes on without major mishaps in a large house surrounded by a beautiful garden. It is a wonderful world, a great bubble of comfort, where different personal spheres coexist: the mother, along with her three children and the Aymara inhabitants of the house. The drama surfaces slowly, without narrative ploys, observing day-to-day activities until internal and external forces make the bubble burst. The film relates the story of the final days of an upper-class family, at a time when the country is undergoing social changes.","popularity":0.1566,"poster_path":"/qvevCZ91MXM5yQQlmeP5j4kRx9a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinenómada","origin_country":"BO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2009-08-20","revenue":107755,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Aymara","iso_639_1":"ay","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southern District","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"南方安逸","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zona Sur (Südzone)","type":"Amazon"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Vargas","original_name":"Mariana Vargas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Bernarda","credit_id":"52fe4631c3a368484e083c11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninón del Castillo","original_name":"Ninón del Castillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Carola","credit_id":"52fe4631c3a368484e083c15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascual Loayza","original_name":"Pascual Loayza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Wilson","credit_id":"52fe4631c3a368484e083c19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolás Fernández","original_name":"Nicolás Fernández","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Andrés","credit_id":"52fe4631c3a368484e083c1d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Pablo Koria","original_name":"Juan Pablo Koria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Patricio","credit_id":"52fe4631c3a368484e083c21","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Carlos Valdivia","original_name":"Juan Carlos Valdivia","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4631c3a368484e083c0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1526317","wikidata_id":"Q6171702","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/bry8zQRbB5vxHnnECFUsqfcNFMb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qvevCZ91MXM5yQQlmeP5j4kRx9a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/vNPhxCL4pQJkP7wvx2dvaIVGrqJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
