Wherever he went, the camera followed. To Tokyo for a concert with Kiri Te Kanawa. To Philadelphia for a teaching session in the Curtis Institute. To Tanglewood for an incredible jazz improvisation recording of Gershwin Variations. To New York to play with the Ray Brown Trio at the Blue Note Club. To Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic. To Washington DC for a concert with the Emerson Quartet. To Boston for a conductor's masterclass with, among others, Daniel Harding. And, of course, the rehearsals and first performance of Streetcar with the incomparable Renee Fleming and director Colin Graham.","popularity":0.1318,"poster_path":"/sgyGwjtvnB9OsKsz2FjNA8ZVPRe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kindness of Strangers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5805,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Previn","original_name":"André Previn","popularity":0.3559,"profile_path":"/eejlWsguIMSXw1arKn4G5e1uhAx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe463ac3a368484e085587","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Palmer","original_name":"Tony Palmer","popularity":0.2878,"profile_path":"/hiyTtRGT64hnMCBz4LCmpPcXTyP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe463ac3a368484e085583","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1864532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1544,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sgyGwjtvnB9OsKsz2FjNA8ZVPRe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1233,"name":"composer"},{"id":337570,"name":"andre previn"},{"id":337571,"name":"oscar-winner"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
