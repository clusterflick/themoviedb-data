His only hope is a transplant from his brother, Paul. But Pierre hates Paul and has refused to see him for the past ten years. They are different in every aspect : their way of life, their tastes. Nevertheless, Marie, Pierre's fiancee, is determined to reconcile the two men. A love-hate relationship develops, disrupting the trio, recomposing the couples and even going so far as to change their personalities. After a few too many drinks and a bit of fooling around, the settling of scores between the two brothers will come to a surprising end.","popularity":0.6041,"poster_path":"/1wq9Umi5eWkP2eTIqsTQXrhM69P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain Sarde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":168443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica Studio Images 8","origin_country":""},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/9tW5wZEGotn1Ei5pErA88m47XiD.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":67543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tentative d'Evasion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slice of Life","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Garcia","original_name":"José Garcia","popularity":0.9469,"profile_path":"/8KqGjV89hgj15yDeWZkk0FUsr13.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a368484e07fe39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Timsit","original_name":"Patrick Timsit","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/lS22SWFT4jo4mgfC0HsbgMstPf2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a368484e07fe35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Denicourt","original_name":"Marianne Denicourt","popularity":0.2588,"profile_path":"/sNY4ToUEb5WniA3JJdUKuvTuDEg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a368484e07fe3d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elise Tielrooy","original_name":"Elise Tielrooy","popularity":0.2054,"profile_path":"/7olETUlEthclPV82lppaLnpen0w.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elizabeth","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a368484e07fe41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natacha Lindinger","original_name":"Natacha Lindinger","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/q8gUBeLrS7RolwpNLemOTFl0yUq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Virginie","credit_id":"61ecc3b217c443001be683b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Rinaldi","original_name":"Gérard Rinaldi","popularity":0.3086,"profile_path":"/a3daXB4wlGJlMy1XJKc1EJP2O8f.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Directeur Thalasso 1","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a368484e07fe45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2567207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Béat","original_name":"Alice Béat","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/b5gt9mlGNhXQYlhIzfoKOlCqhu9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"61ecc3f5cedac4001cac1ec0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Timsit","original_name":"Patrick Timsit","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/lS22SWFT4jo4mgfC0HsbgMstPf2.jpg","credit_id":"52fe461ec3a368484e07fe31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0285964","wikidata_id":"Q3414101","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sB55NcSgY2SmDEaqW34tdZxK2jY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.965,"height":113,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/frU4tNWW8dUyMAukzG9AmDHkKfE.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qkhKSPyQB1vMKN6AcKgWugK2ufn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1542,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1wq9Umi5eWkP2eTIqsTQXrhM69P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1028}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":658,"name":"sea"},{"id":15058,"name":"swimming"},{"id":188179,"name":"soaked clothes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
