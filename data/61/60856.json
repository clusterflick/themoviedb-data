Mach 1, a top secret special operations team, is called in to recover it. The team, lead by Commander Bill McNeil (Steve Guttenberg), boards the thieves' plane midflight and recovers the virus. When two members of the team are subsequently murdered, McNeil suspects that the thieves might have inside help. In an attempt to track down who was responsible, the team steals the virus in a hope that the thieves will come after them.","popularity":2.0208,"poster_path":"/lYSvEpLjbICzha8kosW6IRdevLl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Echo Bridge Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":6560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Monde Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":803,"logo_path":"/jEMVaCuEjQ3lzkhakWDKNVjwd9Q.png","name":"Alliance Atlantis","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":30251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Airborne TV & Film","origin_country":""},{"id":91002,"logo_path":null,"name":"C3 Entertainment, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Secret War.
