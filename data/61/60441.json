Actually, Bill Wright, Mitchell's associate, killed Carter because the ranger had discovered tussock moth infestation in the forest, and if the infestation was not reported, the trees would die and have to be cut, thereby profiting Mitchell and Wright. In order to compensate the best he can, Gene sells his sportsman's camp and gives the money to Carter's daughter Helen . En route to Texas, Gene discovers the infestation and is assigned by the Forest Department to supervise the program of spraying the area with DDT from the air. After the first day of spraying, the DDT is blamed by furious stock men for the many animals found dead of poisoning.","popularity":1.326,"poster_path":"/dnJ4LqEkW8Di1GYlQWP0eGv5f21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gene Autry Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"AUTRY COMES ROARING OUT OF THE SKIES...to save the forests from outlaw lumber ring!","title":"Riders of the Whistling Pines","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Autry","original_name":"Gene Autry","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/tpR8uEfcVmlQA1mQlg4CyljLfMz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gene Autry","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e08115b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Champion","original_name":"Champion","popularity":0.3239,"profile_path":"/eFwxeWH5ZMJnsV7uGUSAnE63aMc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Champion","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e08115f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Barry","original_name":"Patricia Barry","popularity":0.2106,"profile_path":"/wxw6Ml6onth4WEy5PgmP1MxDoQW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Helen Carter","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e081163","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Lloyd","original_name":"Jimmy Lloyd","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/uEvRENH0jC4WxOriC2tggmP3KT7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Joe Lucas","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e08117f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglass Dumbrille","original_name":"Douglass Dumbrille","popularity":0.3535,"profile_path":"/quJC1FBvSzwNuFCQhlzXINXa7ZS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henry Mitchell","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e081183","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian O'Flynn","original_name":"Damian O'Flynn","popularity":0.2498,"profile_path":"/m73AUAIpqv8WL5tiwSB4JvKe5I4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bill Wright","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e081187","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clayton Moore","original_name":"Clayton Moore","popularity":0.8534,"profile_path":"/uJSufv1R4YcwB0scngTkYYJEjds.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Henchman Pete","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e08118b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Cheshire","original_name":"Harry Cheshire","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/eYW4TZXfi6Z0sEkfs3iSYfMQAej.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Dr. Daniel Chadwick","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e081193","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Weaver","original_name":"Leon Weaver","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":"/hMerPxvr13RvKNUMTu1v5UHrXa7.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Abner Weaver","credit_id":"52fe4625c3a368484e08118f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Scoggins","original_name":"Jerry Scoggins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"The Cass County Boys","credit_id":"63b31a285ad76b00ae91b564","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred S.
