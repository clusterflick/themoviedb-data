That initial plan soon fell by the wayside when they secured a record deal and became Genesis, progressing from the underground scene with such albums as \"Trespass\" and \"Nursery Cryme,\" to become household names with the addition of drummer/singer Phil Collins and such chart topping albums as \"We Can't Dance\" and \"Invisible Touch.\" By talking to the individual members of the group, discover what they consider to be their favorite Genesis songs, and why certain songs have a special place in the Genesis story. Song include: I Can't Dance, Invisible Touch, Follow You Follow Me, The Musical Box, Supper's Ready, I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe), The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Afterglow, Misunderstanding, Turn It On Again, Mama, Land of
