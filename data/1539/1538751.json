This Borrowed Land gives the women who farm the Peace the chance to voice their growing concern over the conversion of farmland to uses not related to the production of food. They ask: \"Will we leave our children enough land to grow food on?\" They are firmly committed to their lifestyle despite the difficulties, both concrete and imponderable. A film about agriculture, ecology, land misuse, and stout-willed farmers who happen to be women.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Borrowed Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5660588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Hagan","original_name":"Anna Hagan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"68b378516a673c67091f2190","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5660585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bonnie Kreps","original_name":"Bonnie Kreps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b3779da2cd776ff33efc85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5660585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bonnie Kreps","original_name":"Bonnie Kreps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b377a96a673c67091f2179","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389423,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Haida Paul","original_name":"Haida Paul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b377bdc429144b643efbf7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5660586,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nina Wisnicki","original_name":"Nina Wisnicki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b377d66a673c67091f2183","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3274546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hildegard Westerkamp","original_name":"Hildegard Westerkamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b378c206975622773ccaec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31530618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
