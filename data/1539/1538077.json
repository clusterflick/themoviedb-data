Inspired by this bold outreach, other clinical volunteers joined in, and Operation Safety Net was born.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/20CGKKU7J6JLplIQZNpOrtXpJUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go to the People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Sewald","original_name":"Jeff Sewald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1fb172b33583512397168","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33038152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/20CGKKU7J6JLplIQZNpOrtXpJUH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Touchstone Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
