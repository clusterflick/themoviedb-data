As much as the film stands as a testament to Knight’s craft as editor, it also acts as a thematic dialogue between the dream pop band’s music and the images by one of cinema’s greatest auteurs, spanning Mann’s work from Thief (1981) to Blackhat (2015). It’s a mesmeric work, both visually and sonically, acting also as a document of Knight’s own development as an editor after suffering an injury and using Mann’s footage and the band’s album to relearn how to edit. Mann’s Sparks is a spellbinding celebration of cinematic language and how it can be reused, relearned, and reimagined into new possibilities.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rfBYzvdy5xE5WtfUi7GHWwAXP7t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mann's Sparks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryland Walker Knight","original_name":"Ryland Walker Knight","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1dbe402be9ac67f397056","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rfBYzvdy5xE5WtfUi7GHWwAXP7t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
