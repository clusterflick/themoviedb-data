It also highlights related issues, such as the emergence of the alphabet, the textual studies of Shevchenko's works and his friendly correspondence, his first trip to Ukraine, his arrest, and his last journey in 1860, censorship, and secret surveillance. All of these are closely intertwined with the biography of the \"Kobzar.\" In addition, the biographical facts in this book reveal the emergence of an independent modern Ukrainian identity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/RzhbOFVRiZlkNBmWmqz7Pk7oku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2014-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kobzar.
