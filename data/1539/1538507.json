'Returning Home' follows the same Muslim families seven years later as they rebuild their lives in their devastated village. It illustrates the decisive role of the international community in facilitating returns, the steely determination of displaced villagers to return, and their surprisingly sympathetic attitude toward Croat refugees living in their homes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9aCTMgId4dVCfyghLfqaVAoV8cO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Returning Home: Revival of a Bosnian Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5548386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tone Bringa","original_name":"Tone Bringa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b30f58da6801e9a19e1682","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5659852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Loizos","original_name":"Peter Loizos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b30f636dd16f100b3ccb49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9aCTMgId4dVCfyghLfqaVAoV8cO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
