Their journey becomes a modern David and Goliath story as they take on institutional power, doubt, and inertia. Directed by award-winning documentary filmmaker Michèle Hozer (Shake Hands with the Devil, Genius Within: The Inner Life of Glenn Gould, Sugar Coated), the film was shot extensively across the country, including Olympic medalist Erin McLeod's return home to play for the Halifax Tides. The Pitch offers rare access to this fight to change the game: a universal story of resilience and rewriting the rules.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Pitch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":230201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michèle Hozer","original_name":"Michèle Hozer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b34d0fb4c1faef5ab4edfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Atlantic International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
