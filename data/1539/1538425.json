Quick to dish out some gospel with a scoop of ice cream, Roy preaches to many customers but particularly needles Josh, the cab driver with \"a real dilly\" of an ulcer. \"Sounds like you need food for the soul,\" Roy says. With his brimstone counter behavior (and creepy automaton looks) driving customers away, Gertie asks Roy to can \"the religious talk\". Roy is understandably torn between honoring his family’s wishes and doing what he knows is right. As a fellow Christian tells him, he’s \"really in a spot.\" But before long, he’s got Aunt Gertie piping hymns into the shop, customers or no customers. Hallelujah! (Question: is the RICHARD MILES who stars in this and Teenage Crusade the same Richard Miles who co-wrote that quintessential Christian classic They Saved Hitler’s Brain?)","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dAQnrF03ExmpdZ9Rb7WUGZljcrA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Family Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teenage Testament","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dAQnrF03ExmpdZ9Rb7WUGZljcrA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
