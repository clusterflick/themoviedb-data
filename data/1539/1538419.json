With the school play and other activities, she neglects her responsibilities as head of her youth group, particularly in trying to find a filmstrip on Africa. When she asks for help too late, her friends turn her down. One guy uses the excuse that he has to help the old farts at the retirement home. Even hunky foreign exchange student Carlos canâ€™t pitch in: \"Sounds like you are -- how you say? -- off the beam.\" In fact, Jean is so busy she's even missed family devotions --several times! At her breaking point, Jean reads the Bible and suddenly figures it all out: \"I spread myself so thin, I forgot my chief loyalty...My loyalty to Christ!\" Once again, all is happy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1k31uQn3swQyWLr4u2sBES0V9en.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Family Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teenage Loyalty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1k31uQn3swQyWLr4u2sBES0V9en.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
