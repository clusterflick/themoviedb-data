After the cop confers with the boy's grim-faced pa, PAUL BRYAR, the little delinquent is enrolled in Sunday school! And-- surprise, surprise -- once the kid is given a lil' new Testament all his own (\"Isn't it slick! Can I write my name in it, Pa?\") he decides stealing alarm clocks just isn't his style anymore. And Yes, all is happy. Those Lutherans really do have all the answers!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/AbzNK0Cge66vLE27rzx2V1SWVrt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Right Start","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AbzNK0Cge66vLE27rzx2V1SWVrt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
