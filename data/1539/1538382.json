During one such repair, the Americans cannot communicate with the owner of the house, who is dissatisfied with their work. The language barrier prevents them from clearly explaining the problem to each other. A separate storyline in the film consists of episodes from the lives of the locals: their attempts to dig out their house, survive the winter, and... find the culprit.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Language Barrier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4947990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhora Papoian","original_name":"Zhora Papoian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b2d9311993120f591f1c54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4947990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhora Papoian","original_name":"Zhora Papoian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b2d93bc429144b643ef8db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LIFT Short Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
