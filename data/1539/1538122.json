The Artfully United Tour transforms from a simple idea on a wall to a community of artists and activists coming together to heal and uplift the city they call home. As the murals are unveiled, this gritty documentary explores the forces that shape the streets of L.A. and those that shape Mike as an artist, delving into his past to create a rich tapestry of family and faith, love and loss, music, hope, and life. Artfully United, the first feature-length documentary from Chris Walters Productions, is a celebration of the power of positivity and a reminder that hope can sometimes grow in the most unlikely of places.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artfully United","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vacationland Film Festival","release_date":"2025-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"GreenPoint Film Festival","release_date":"2025-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
