In the meantime, he chooses a free apartment in the very center of the city - the roof of a multi-story building. It soon turns out that a teenager with autism, Kostik, who runs away from an apartment in the building and calls himself \"Agent Koklinch\", also considers the roof his own. While they fight for territory, Kostik regains his lost speech, and his family clings to Damir as if he were a miracle worker. But Damir has enough of his own problems, but everything changes with the appearance of Sofia, a student of Kostik's mother. In pursuit of the girl's heart, Damir throws himself into an adventure that makes him reconsider his ideas about normality.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":"/4I13zI6s0b1YYQRA9x3pQVSUhG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254594,"logo_path":null,"name":"SMAG Production","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2024-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizens of the Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5269373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eldar Abish","original_name":"Елдар Абиш","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67be177ddd0adec14d560a6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5269375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Cherepanov","original_name":"Александр Черепанов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67be179cf32e950c4a3d2fcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4946911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Лидия Ярцева","original_name":"Лидия Ярцева","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67be17bbe26422352def9a19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":552125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Landina","original_name":"Olga Landina","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67be17dee26422352def9a31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Genādijs Zemels","original_name":"Genādijs Zemels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67be17f00ff6643e713d2f31","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2399202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhannat Khudaibergenova","original_name":"Жанна Куанышева","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sjJo9PYV9pkZD88hUg4ow5g5Pvw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67be1810dd0adec14d560ad2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5269384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gulshat Smagulova","original_name":"Гульшат Смагулова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be183fc3f8c5a804ef9c49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5269389,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zhanna Timofeeva","original_name":"Жанна Тимофеева","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be186ff32e950c4a3d3028","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5269392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aliya Sharipbaeva","original_name":"Алия Шарипбаева","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be18a10ff6643e713d2f87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279668,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandr Plotnikov","original_name":"Александр Плотников","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be18c4f32e950c4a3d3040","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2084216,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Viktor Sologub","original_name":"Виктор Сологуб","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8dWPwJUeSjLGmI7fuwz0AFkW16P.jpg","credit_id":"67be18d6e26422352def9ac2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5269398,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elena Aitova","original_name":"Елена Аитова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be18ed10b465da0256123c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"kk","file_path":"/4I13zI6s0b1YYQRA9x3pQVSUhG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spirit Of Fire International Festival Of Cinematographic Debuts","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
