The film uses a high-stakes card game as a metaphor for the complexities of human connection. As players navigate the intricacies of strategy and chance, their moves reveal deeper themes of trust, vulnerability, and the unpredictable nature of relationships. The narrative weaves humor with tension, inviting viewers to reflect on how every decision—both in the game and in life—carries emotional weight and potential for unexpected outcomes, resonating with the modern queer experience.","popularity":0.3358,"poster_path":"/rzHgG2nlI41wTN8O9IGNr8bJNEn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bridge Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Massey","original_name":"Jennifer Massey","popularity":0.0963,"profile_path":"/mh9kIYPPdwmjOswU7yE7zHxdAjC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67bcc7f0472875122ba473af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5267195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tessa Cavaletto","original_name":"Tessa Cavaletto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67bcc7fcaf7ae4a6f26be395","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4802706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolyn Robertson","original_name":"Carolyn Robertson","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67bcc8099c230b52e599a1ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5267197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Mitts Martin","original_name":"Leslie Mitts Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67bcc8132af972d2d8a48108","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5267189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David L.
