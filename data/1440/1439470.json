It asks the timeless question of humanity: Can we treat the person whom we do not know, the stranger whom we fear and maybe even see as the enemy, as a brother? Shot on the streets of New York City the film celebrates the idea that every person has a dream and that it is never too late to be a pioneer of peace and truth in this world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xwgDPFIjd2U5hsrvjeWgVU4bxYV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be My Brother","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Summa","original_name":"Christopher Summa","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/1cUCdpMHFDnScarSnqUXgl77AlX.jpg","credit_id":"67bcf1c012bfc85bc36be1bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Summa","original_name":"Christopher Summa","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/1cUCdpMHFDnScarSnqUXgl77AlX.jpg","credit_id":"67bcf1d752d870585899a782","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0939590","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xwgDPFIjd2U5hsrvjeWgVU4bxYV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
