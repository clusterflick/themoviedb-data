A cursed encounter amid the gore finds her on the run from a cannibalistic killer, all while her grasp on reality disintegrates. On the surface, My Silence, My Grave is simple horror story about a woman trapped between losing her humanity and her life. But under the surface, where most of society's pervasive ills lie, it's a story about one woman's fight against a sordid system that pits marginalized peoples against each other. Through physical horror and psychological unease, Julia realizes that her own inaction has only served to hurt other minorities and to preserve the power of their oppressors.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Silence, My Grave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nowa Clark","original_name":"Nowa Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Julia Delaney","credit_id":"67be7b40f32e950c4a3d3bb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adra Mayer","original_name":"Adra Mayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Malika Green","credit_id":"67be7b4bf32e950c4a3d3bc0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cindy Xu","original_name":"Cindy Xu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Zhen Warner","credit_id":"67be7b64e26422352defa449","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donté Larry","original_name":"Donté Larry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7b7112942e54d73d374e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donté Larry","original_name":"Donté Larry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7b7910b465da02562a6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donté Larry","original_name":"Donté Larry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7b7fe26422352defa45b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandesh Agrawal","original_name":"Sandesh Agrawal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7ba010b465da02562a78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grace Ward","original_name":"Grace Ward","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7bdcf9755fe09d5616fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4765054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mateo Sicilia","original_name":"Mateo Sicilia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7bf76f07f08cd5561802","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942201,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mapi Bartolome","original_name":"Mapi Bartolome","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7c20e26422352defa4af","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354792,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Myzia","original_name":"Paul Myzia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7c3712942e54d73d378d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333798,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexia Haick","original_name":"Alexia Haick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be7c4f12942e54d73d379c","department":"Production","job":"Casting"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Silence, My Grave BTS Trailer","key":"ii9dxCIuuVg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-28T15:39:32.000Z","id":"67be7aff39cb7820d0ef9ec9"}]}}}
