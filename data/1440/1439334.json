While Jiang finds solace in their bohemian routine, Wen Hao burns with unfulfilled ambitions. His world tilts when he falls for Li Ying—a love that fuels his artistic drive but blinds him to Jiang Zhen’s quiet loyalty. As Wen Hao chases success and romance, Jiang, feeling increasingly invisible, moves out, leaving behind fractured camaraderie.  Unbeknownst to Wen Hao, Li Ying is married to Wang Peng, a man with shadowy ties to Jiang Zhen. The fragile façade shatters when fate converges all four at a gallery opening. Secrets detonate: Jiang confesses his long-suppressed feelings for Wen Hao; Li Ying reveals her pregnancy; and Wang Peng, cloaked in unsettling civility, unveils a meticulously orchestrated scheme to dismantle Wen Hao’s life—using Jiang’s vulnerability and Li Ying’s divided heart as pawns.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet You Halfway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
