Bound by societal constraints and fear of rejection, he buries these feelings deep within—until he discovers Yao Tai's girlfriend entangled with her ex. Choosing silence to protect Yao Tai’s fragile heart, Zong Ze watches helplessly as Yao Tai eventually uncovers the betrayal himself, leading to a bitter breakup.  Emboldened by the aftermath, Zong Ze confesses his love, only to be met with Yao Tai’s cold rejection. Shattered, he flees to Thailand, where he undergoes gender confirmation surgery and rebuilds his identity. Seven years later, he returns—as a woman—reintroducing himself to Yao Tai under a new name. What begins as cautious reconnection blooms into forbidden attraction, weaving a dangerous tapestry of desire and deception. Now, Zong Ze faces an agonizing question: Can love built on buried truths survive when the past claws its way back?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"男颜之瘾","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
