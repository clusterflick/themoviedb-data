Haoyu's lifelong physical trauma from a childhood accident and his reckless financial gambles have shackled him to perpetual despair, viewing the inheritance as his sole redemption.  Enter An Yi, Haoyu's guilt-ridden childhood friend who believes himself responsible for the accident that doomed Haoyu's life. Driven by penitence, An Yi begins nightly infiltrations into Yaru's mansion, orchestrating clandestine schemes to salvage Haoyu's fate. What begins as a twisted act of atonement evolves into an obsessive bond between the three—until calculated interventions spiral into grotesque accidents, hurtling them toward catastrophic and irreversible consequences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Potential","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
