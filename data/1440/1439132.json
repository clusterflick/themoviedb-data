Amidst this struggle, he encounters a man who ignites an all-consuming love—a connection so electric it consumes them both. Yet, their respite is fleeting. In a society hostile to their love, they endure vicious mockery from peers and societal condemnation, culminating in the student's expulsion. His aging parents, heartbroken and disillusioned, grudgingly acquiesce, their hopes frayed but clinging to a thread.  Tragedy compounds as the lovers, desperate to survive cascading calamities, begin withholding painful truths and even resort to selling their bodies. Each betrayal deepens their despair, eroding their bond until they teeter on the edge of oblivion—casualties of a world that weaponizes love into a death sentence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Innate Differences","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Qafone","release_date":"2018-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
