This newly digitized 16mm film is an experimental and thought-provoking exploration of memory, reality, and the social conventions of 1970s middle-class aspirations. Dr. Smith attributes Wanzer's dazzling array of stylistic techniques to his love for avant-garde pioneers like Maya Deren, Jean Cocteau, and Ingmar Bergman. George Andrews employs montage, slow-motion, and non-linear storytelling to challenge conventional cinematic norms as it challenges the conventional worldviews of its characters.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/pzB3cGpCYAFBI21NzjvHzi9bvHk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Andrews","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Moreland","original_name":"Wes Moreland","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Phillip","credit_id":"67bd8a94970950a4b35e9b0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5268300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamie Smith","original_name":"Tamie Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"67bd8abcb41e95d32c599b2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Orville Wanzer","original_name":"Orville Wanzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"George Andrews","credit_id":"67bd8ad10d1175783f599b04","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5268304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Smith","original_name":"Claudia Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"67bd8b590d1175783f599b3c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Orville Wanzer","original_name":"Orville Wanzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bd4cdf472875122ba48257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Orville Wanzer","original_name":"Orville Wanzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bd4cf2864b550c8a6becb0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pzB3cGpCYAFBI21NzjvHzi9bvHk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
