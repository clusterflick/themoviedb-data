Despite Sun's incarceration, Cheng supported him, sending necessities and visiting whenever possible, driven by instinct rather than expecting a reunion. After three years, Sun was released in 2008, and Cheng greeted him with traditional customs, including firecrackers and new clothes. However, Sun's family, particularly his mother, disapproved of their relationship, leading to conflicts between the couple. The 2009 film The Blue Sun portrays their love story, reflecting the struggles of same-sex couples in China and highlighting the challenges faced by the homosexual rights movement. The film blends personal hardship with social commentary on growing visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ+ people in mainland China.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Wei","original_name":"Zhang Wei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680433a75836966f76aced38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beijing Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2009-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
