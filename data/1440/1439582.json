The top fight of the card is currently scheduled to be a clash between featherweights Kleber Koike and Kyohei Hagiwara. Koike, a former KSW Champion, has yet to lose since joining RIZIN in late 2020. He scored his fourth consecutive submission win for the promotion in February, catching Ulka Saski with a rear naked choke in the main event of a “TRIGGER” card.  On the other hand, Hagiwara will be fighting to bounce back from a loss. He had a two-fight winning streak snapped in his last appearance, as Satoshi Yamasu submitted him in the main event of RIZIN 34 in March.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/9hmJBxBAqdtLjedSzebe6gq6J7H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245969,"logo_path":"/uQ1P4jxiRaKMTfXWYTm5rbEVICf.png","name":"RIZIN Fighting Federation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kleber Koike vs. Kyohei Hagiwara","title":"RIZIN LANDMARK vol.3","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5253598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuyuki Sakakibara","original_name":"Nobuyuki Sakakibara","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/wC138I48SZlGV7OvV1NN0jDi0ft.jpg","credit_id":"67bd73c60d1175783f59972b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.666,"height":592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cf2oHNIJgQi9sSEV4oHiiC7lxjo.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2762}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9hmJBxBAqdtLjedSzebe6gq6J7H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9917,"name":"mixed martial arts (mma)"},{"id":192790,"name":"combat sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
