He draws all his inspiration from this place, and tells Fränz Hausemer many of his secrets, even though some of his landmarks are gradually beginning to disappear. This portrait of a singular man is interspersed with spellbinding pieces, the contours of which are drawn from Rollinger’s own poetry.","popularity":0.1425,"poster_path":"/YR5MywFwR7DdzBeNMmfdt8WEbC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2025-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Letzeburgesch","iso_639_1":"lb","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terre Rouge - Topographie du poète","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Lorenzini","original_name":"Marco Lorenzini","popularity":0.2323,"profile_path":"/pGdKm9CMAMldaE8sWkoQi2gOJCe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67bc8f3147b776f3284677eb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5266661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fränz Hausemer","original_name":"Fränz Hausemer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bc8ef5ab8fd8a268beab0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5266661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fränz Hausemer","original_name":"Fränz Hausemer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bc8f1e47b776f3284677e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5266661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fränz Hausemer","original_name":"Fränz Hausemer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bc8f27ab8fd8a268beab19","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikos Welter","original_name":"Nikos Welter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bc8f4247b776f3284677f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/YR5MywFwR7DdzBeNMmfdt8WEbC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1241}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Luxembourg City Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TERRE ROUGE - Topographie du poète | Trailer","key":"Mbwu2y2HorU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-24T12:15:06.000Z","id":"67c9ade8bd7861478b24bed3"}]}}}
