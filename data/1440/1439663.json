Yet, in far-off corners of the world, children rise and dream as one. Under the olive trees, they find words to multiply, pages to paint, letters to send — a chorus of hope, woven to be shared.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams under the Olive Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5268623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merve Cirisoglu","original_name":"Merve Cirisoglu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bdb906b41e95d32c599c47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
