For the next one hundred years, Dorian Gray falls into a rabbit-hole of debauchery, remaining forever young while his portrait pays the price for each of his sins. But when crimes of decades past come back to haunt him, and the novelty of everlasting youth starts taking its toll, can his soul still be redeemed?","popularity":0.2891,"poster_path":"/1OfpanaaUymW3CiWNs6akIDPsRT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2027-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post
