Four directors, four screenwriters and four cameramen created a bizarre illusion of tension and diverse anxiety in separate stories. The short story DUET confronts you with the current threat of growing terrorism and our fear of the unknown. In the second short OPUS DEI, we find ourselves in a horror story, in an old abandoned house that hides a dark secret from the 2nd World War. The third and most controversial short story GRASSVATER forces you to look away from the screen – you are looking at scenes from eastern Slovakia, which are presented very expressively, without embellishments in all their ugliness. There are drugs, mafia, intrigue and a panopticon of characters. The last, visually refined, short story GAME raises the question of where the boundaries of television entertainment end and how far we are willing to go.","popularity":0.415,"poster_path":"/sBQighWPhhWY5NTbkGewDbjIICd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"4
