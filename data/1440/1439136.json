She recruits her squad: He Nügui, a psychiatrist prodigy; AK, a martial arts goddess; and BOBO, a hacker savant—forming the Apocalypse Agency. Together, they accept \"Scumbag Bounties\", delivering karmic retribution with surgical precision.  Case 1: The Human Teddy  Womanizer Ouyang is gaslit into believing he’s terminally ill, tormented by a sleazy TCM quack’s ominous hints until his libido becomes his prison.  Case 2: The Wolf in Scholar’s Clothing  Bai Shuping, a wife-beating hypocrite, undergoes hypnotic conditioning that triggers humiliating public meltdowns whenever his rage flares.  Case 3: The Mr. Perfect Facade  When Gary’s wife exposes his mistress, the team orchestrates a fake kidnapping/birthday surprise to unmask his infidelity—only to unravel a twist darker than betrayal itself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punishment for Douchebag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
