While audiences weep for the butterfly lovers’ eternal bond, Shan knows too well the chasm separating theatrical passion from life’s stark prose.  As Chen vanishes and her mother-in-law Lu Xiuzhen’s tragic history surfaces, Shan confronts her crossroad: perpetuate the ornate lie of tradition or dismantle the gilded cage. Beneath the phoenix crown and painted brows, a quiet revolution brews—not with arias, but the tremulous courage to rewrite her script beyond society’s stage.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beijing Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
