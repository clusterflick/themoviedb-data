By day, he mindlessly minds a mobile phone store; by night, he secretly indulges in cross-dressing—a fragile identity he guards like a wounded bird. Across the city, Han—a burglar trapped in a loveless marriage—shatters Hua's solitude during a botched robbery. Within those four walls, two souls cloaked in urban anonymity collide, their mirrored loneliness sparking an unlikely connection that threatens to unravel both their carefully constructed masks.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eccentrics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
