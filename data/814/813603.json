Revelations of Divine Love dared to present an alternative vision of man's relationship with God, a theology fundamentally at odds with the church of Julian's time, and for 500 years the book was suppressed. It re-emerged in the 20th century as an iconic text for the women's movement and was acknowledged as a literary masterpiece.","popularity":0.4921,"poster_path":"/g0d4Mv9PSKS6ibpu9FIjSceYuIV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":114461,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tin Can Island","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Search for the Lost Manuscript: Julian of Norwich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Julian of Norwich: The Search for the Lost Manuscript","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Ramirez","original_name":"Janina Ramirez","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/rykuMTefLLKsg8JssYwhBFeqpFX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"6068af9e699fb70040f76b19","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally-Anne Lomas","original_name":"Sally-Anne Lomas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6068afd5d036b60058a26c5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7328350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g0d4Mv9PSKS6ibpu9FIjSceYuIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":156043,"name":"religious hypocrisy"},{"id":163160,"name":"early church"},{"id":226350,"name":"religious controversy"},{"id":246414,"name":"women and society"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
