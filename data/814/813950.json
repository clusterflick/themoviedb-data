Marion Sims on South Carolina slave girls, and the continuing medical larceny against Henrietta Lacks, they are likely unaware of the routine medical barbarism that persists today. The film pulls back the curtain on atrocities hiding in plain sight and takes viewers on an unprecedented journey to unearth the truth. It shows viewers:  That medical racism has happened before, and awareness will help ensure it doesn’t happen again  How racism in the drug industry impacts the Black community  Why, when our bodies and risk are involved, it shouldn’t be about governmental control  How to feel empowered to have a voice about health choices","popularity":0.1379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The New Apartheid","title":"Medical Racism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3037646,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Centner","original_name":"David Centner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606a09a009c24c002a3dd71f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert F.
