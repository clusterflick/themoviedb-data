Through life-size projections onto a big screen, Syrian director Rami Farah confronts the three men with footage, some of it their own, depicting events that changed their destinies forever. Watching the brutal footage together, they reflect on their personal journeys, revive their collective memory, and wonder what is left of their hopes and dreams. Their reunion serves as a unique window into the complexity of the situation in Syria, where a peaceful uprising was replaced by a ferocious war.","popularity":0.128,"poster_path":"/dNtFK7NA4TDiL58HLfn7HcEsSOQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":186890,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Screen Off Record","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2021-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Memory Belongs to Us","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rami Farah","original_name":"Rami Farah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6066c76603bf8400291ddd3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14520578","wikidata_id":"Q117310951","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9PZxq8b8tnshIgqB5d1edpKBCGw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zZg50Er34WqY7uV3jgfNwRKOqcx.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a41bKx94LszGgh6RS3VEE2lCTVa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/hLk0K1Bs12WuCuXtQYBkY0wvJO4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/GRlokpQUhHmKUf808BLCtay5fl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vfq940q2dbR8jNhPbE0yEjez67s.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rXwE9AiHgAnRVOebmW2J3iBsFA6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dNtFK7NA4TDiL58HLfn7HcEsSOQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2021-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
