Combining these feedback systems led to the emergence of colorful, blobby objects which reacted in a somewhat explosive manner when colliding with each other or with the bounds of the video space. When putting the piece together, I structured its form around these moments of meeting, and the final video was ultimately recorded in one take through the sequencing of feedback parameter changes. The music in the film was put together after the creation of the video, and uses a number of different instrumental samples like flutes, clarinets, wind chimes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2MhY3Cx8s84Vn2OgpFpFdRQuCqM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Contact","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Dupuis","original_name":"Alexander Dupuis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6067c91fd768fe0058cdd452","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2MhY3Cx8s84Vn2OgpFpFdRQuCqM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
