Wildlife filmmaker Phil Timpany has chronicled her all her life. Now he's capturing her first steps into adulthood--and motherhood--and the many challenges threatening both her and her rambunctious cubs. Witness Sophie's journey as she learns the ropes, trying to balance her own needs with feeding and protecting her young. More than half of all grizzly cubs die in their first year, so Sophie has little room for error.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/i0JXPqBcdzunUyThBYgTEYummyn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73476,"logo_path":"/5W3tLJvJ9kasywjuuDO6adTux0v.png","name":"Omnifilm Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yukon's Wild Grizzlies","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3035255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Timpany","original_name":"Phil Timpany","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60679977124c8d0078d013fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16252664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q2mpoiIsk1IYJd88tFaaMHaDSXF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i0JXPqBcdzunUyThBYgTEYummyn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNYlmdMCJOqdsxysPcDshARFoS5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/39pDiuquo6aodGqoe9xAgbOmgu5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
