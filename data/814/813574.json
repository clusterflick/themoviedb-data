Travel to the islands of Southeast Asia––from the towering city of Singapore to the squalid encampments of Borneo. Ferry through Cambodia’s remote river country, visit a Buddhist monastery where people with AIDS are living and dying, and rejoice with new believers in a house church in Indonesia. Here is an inside look at the radical rescue work of the Gospel on the frontier of human need.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rAPxuMt1tCBsZ1wKdgTkSNchMcz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dispatches from the Front - Southeast Asia: Islands on the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1471,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rAPxuMt1tCBsZ1wKdgTkSNchMcz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1036}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
