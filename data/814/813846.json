It would offer an opportunity to investigate the limits of the medium film and, just like poetry, not to focus on the story but to tackle universal and grander themes through mood and form. In the end, eight short films were realized, by eight different filmmakers. The films are connected by intermezzi, aerial shots of the Zeeland coasts. Poems of the Sea is a stirring and surprising portrayal of Zeeland. Filled with desires and passion.","popularity":0.1319,"poster_path":"/A0sdEseOwbL58akmJV5cwT6hb46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poems from the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik de Bruyn","original_name":"Erik de Bruyn","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a8f60d2f530040a0e198","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ate de Jong","original_name":"Ate de Jong","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/7CccV2n5Xe1RtRRImezylYLPYZS.jpg","credit_id":"6069a9011cc4ff00581b5298","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Digna Sinke","original_name":"Digna Sinke","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a93d12c604005731bb24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lammers","original_name":"David Lammers","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a927ebb99d00598f03d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara van Gool","original_name":"Clara van Gool","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a94f12c604006ead60ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3037159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne van de Putte","original_name":"Anne van de Putte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a9311e9225002b6173bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kees Hin","original_name":"Kees Hin","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a9165507e90029b17db3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414420,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Wouter van Reijen","original_name":"Jan Wouter van Reijen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6069a957d3d387002a7eb91f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jos de Putter","original_name":"Jos de Putter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f9897ca4f67007fc2c9cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8592552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A0sdEseOwbL58akmJV5cwT6hb46.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
