This wonderfully good news that was first announced to the women at the Empty Tomb is still being declared boldly in the Middle East by the Risen King’s messengers! Dispatches from the Front goes into this region of centuries-old darkness and division that is now overshadowed by the fierce violence of ISIS terror. Yet, the Gospel is powerfully at work in the Middle East, and Christ is building His Church there just as He said He would. Neither the gates of hell nor the gates of Islam can withstand the work of our Risen King! From mega-cities in Arabia to refugee camps left in the wake of ISIS terror, The Fourth Man goes beyond the headlines to showcase the Gospel’s power to save, the mercy and love of believers, and their abiding joy as Christ walks through the fires of persecution with them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/l7RhRolceWaPzB98MHZotk4cSby.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dispatches from the Front - The Middle East: The Fourth Man","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1471,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l7RhRolceWaPzB98MHZotk4cSby.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1036}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
