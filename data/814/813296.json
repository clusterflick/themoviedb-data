The objects and images are rather metaphors–i. e., the pale, barren snow scenes–for the girl's state. Further, they place her isolation in a more general context than that of a single person's experience. The film creates a whole system which describes that isolation. This is made clearer still by the end, which alters the girl's color and removes her from her relatively personalized room.\" –B.
