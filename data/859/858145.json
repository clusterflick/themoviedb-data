It is shot by photographer Motohashi Seiichi, known as the director of Alexei and the Spring (Alexei to Izumi) and others. Set in Senegal in West Africa, where modernization in urban areas is advancing and the Baobab trees, which used to be worshipped, are now being logged, the work closely depicts life in the humble village of Touba Toul, where people continue to lead a traditional lifestyle. It is a brilliant film subtly featuring the coexistence of mankind and nature through the modest life of Modou, a 12-year old boy who is the second son of a big family.","popularity":0.0531,"poster_path":"/GCAnbXmMsTCNN8pHNYxBO4AxXk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pole Pole Times","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thousand Year Song of Baobab","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Baobabu no kioku","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isao Hashizume","original_name":"橋爪功","popularity":0.7807,"profile_path":"/pM8AweTuMvGoWjxPgneHW7siYKy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"610b66b538469a005caab57c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Modou Diouf","original_name":"Modou Diouf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"610b66c5b234b90074e58666","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mbaye Diouf","original_name":"Mbaye Diouf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"610b66ddeea34d002d48e8bc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186779,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bajune Tobeta","original_name":"Bajune Tobeta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b6533dcf87500303b0757","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186778,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kimiko Ishi","original_name":"Kimiko Ishi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b652738469a004525a6df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seiichi Motohashi","original_name":"Seiichi Motohashi","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b5f2fe7868700465ac88d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186780,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Masaru Muramoto","original_name":"Masaru Muramoto","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b654b8d22fc005fa5db02","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737318,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masafumi Ichinose","original_name":"Masafumi Ichinose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b653e5c5634005df37366","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichi Doi","original_name":"Koichi Doi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2ab7de7c097014acf093b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497830,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshiteru Takahashi","original_name":"Yoshiteru Takahashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d05746b5ee0e397c609645","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1390927","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1064,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/GCAnbXmMsTCNN8pHNYxBO4AxXk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6HvqvXB47AzKtJBkYKWi0u9DDbz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
