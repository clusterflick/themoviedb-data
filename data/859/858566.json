Whatever they seek to avoid or escape, the survivalist real estate market is booming. Director Arianna LaPenne peers into the motivations of middle class families uprooting their lives to live in converted military bunkers in response to society's collective anxieties. LaPenne finds a fledgling community around shared ideas, neighborly celebrations, and self-determination. The film investigates the compelling questions surrounding what problems human beings bring along with them when they seek to leave society behind.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/y4b4Qr14ITHzkBafSCEKA81h6IE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29605,"logo_path":"/bSjv2Cinm8LoadffAngaQek4WLW.png","name":"CNN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bunker Boom: Better Safe Than Sorry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arianna LaPenne","original_name":"Arianna LaPenne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d52f1f6fd18002dfeb5c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3704052,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michelle Kim","original_name":"Michelle Kim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6325bb9684f2490082b4ebd5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426834,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Bolen","original_name":"David Bolen","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6325bb6afd4a96007a2922a2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15139786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dD3dAR4Hc55lXObiXjuovvQ3hP1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cWrXMmX9NOK9gYGjIozolpyMrdw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y4b4Qr14ITHzkBafSCEKA81h6IE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NfgHtREwuzH2ps7E6dsqclJsKZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1168},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2069,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7RKIguB6m0IgL8bOqY10Ilxg4uJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1379}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CNN Short Films","release_date":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
