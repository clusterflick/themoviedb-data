In Uruguay there are still a lot of desaparecidos - people who vanished during the dictatorship between 1973 and 1985 - and were never found again. María Emilia is one of them and still missing. She disappeared when she was 22-years-old, with her husband and her child of 18 months. María Esther - her mother - spent 16 years searching only to finally find her granddaughter living with a family of an Argentinean military officer in Buenos Aires. After learning the truth about her origin, the granddaughter chose to continue living with the parents who adopted her by force when she was a baby.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/dyiobchAGjtxP8eIhRJaJOPN7IT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158673,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTC Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":24283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hanfgarn & Ufer Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2009-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vacuum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143587,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gunter Hanfgarn","original_name":"Gunter Hanfgarn","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecdc95bce9e005e50893a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456798,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrik Metzger","original_name":"Patrik Metzger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ece0d7719d700457cf874","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189969,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pablo Cámpora","original_name":"Pablo Cámpora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ece213bd26e00471ac696","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404937,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabián Oliver","original_name":"Fabián Oliver","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecdfe92e55b005e8458c1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Teresa Curzio","original_name":"María Teresa Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecd8e38469a00452b946b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bárbara Álvarez","original_name":"Bárbara Álvarez","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecde1b33903005e1afe80","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bárbara Álvarez","original_name":"Bárbara Álvarez","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecdd9ee43e80027d5c13e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143587,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gunter Hanfgarn","original_name":"Gunter Hanfgarn","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecdc2323eba005ddcc9e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ann-Marie Almada","original_name":"Ann-Marie Almada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ece187719d7002ca9b3dc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Teresa Curzio","original_name":"María Teresa Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecd96b339030074236995","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Teresa Curzio","original_name":"María Teresa Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecda85bce9e002cfd0b0f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Teresa Curzio","original_name":"María Teresa Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ecd9f92e55b002a5f2c3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1562473","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ojYt0qjiTvPWR6EZlAME3T8OjG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dyiobchAGjtxP8eIhRJaJOPN7IT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer  Vacuum","key":"owZfdBY_u7I","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-08-05T00:10:18.000Z","id":"610eccceb33903005e1afbd4"}]}}}
