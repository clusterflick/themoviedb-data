Once settled in Cairo the family opened a perfume shop and Lewin’s grandmother—who had a degree in chemistry—invented a scent called Fez that was presented in a bottle in the shape of the common Fez hat. The bottles were stacked in the shop window when one day King Fuad I happened to drive past, stopped the royal car and bought all the stock. Fez became the Royal Perfume and the family stayed in Cairo for two years.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/rORyvvLPb6bNZKmXeG6ZC3ehEHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fez: The Royal Scent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2271370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Banatvala","original_name":"Rebecca Banatvala","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mahmoud - Enayet","credit_id":"67bcd3ca472875122ba4755f","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8962328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/rORyvvLPb6bNZKmXeG6ZC3ehEHv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"John Hansard Gallery","release_date":"2019-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
