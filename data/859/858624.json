However, on returning to Ikom, he soon discovered that the house had been given away by the family and that it had become a retail store. Staring at a place he once called home himself, not being able to access it like he used to, he decided instead to document who was living right before his eyes.  Thus, Velvet is a poetic appreciation of Ubi's maternal grandpa - a gentle and introspective black and white film, focusing on texture, routine and ageing. The film invites us to consider our elders and the histories they carry on their bodies.","popularity":0.0411,"poster_path":"/sZWqBVPjeE38EghEVcbWwgwePXO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Velvet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odo Effimi","original_name":"Odo Effimi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Grandpa","credit_id":"610d72c1931ea10073c489fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188727,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ofem Ubi","original_name":"Ofem Ubi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d72da7719d70072c9fd92","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188727,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ofem Ubi","original_name":"Ofem Ubi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d72e1323eba0046dadeaf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sZWqBVPjeE38EghEVcbWwgwePXO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
