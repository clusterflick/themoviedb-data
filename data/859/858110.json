Take a clear plastic body-length lightweight bag for instance: it can be worn to maintain body warmth (staving off hypothermia), strung between two trees to create a tube tent shelter, or wrapped around the branch of a deciduous tree to produce water. Ward teaches viewers how to build a fire (even one-handed), set up various shelters, make a slingshot with medical tubing (also handy for a tourniquet), and signal for help.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dbNCPAreZ7lsIkZ0cPYtnn8DEyk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival Beyond The 10 Essentials","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbNCPAreZ7lsIkZ0cPYtnn8DEyk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
