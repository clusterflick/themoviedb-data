These opening shots outline the context in which I hope the bulk of the film will be seen: as a critique on so-called visual literacy, which is frequently based on a complacent mis-reading of images, and also as a rejection of film-biography, whose efficacy depends on such visual complacency. The body of the film consists of fragmentary views of the interior of a house, in which desultory activity occasionally takes place, sometimes in front of the camera, sometimes not. A ghost story is told, firewood is sorted.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":"/huCYKfTUIk8hqIJDav0Q8XaFT5W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicky Hamlyn","original_name":"Nicky Hamlyn","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610dc44f263462005d070877","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/huCYKfTUIk8hqIJDav0Q8XaFT5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
