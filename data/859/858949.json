It was originally meant to encompass all of Manhattan Island up to the Cloisters, but time and money ran out of Midtown Manhattan. The work was desinged for 88 glass-enclosed space with thirty-foot high ceilings. To prepare for this huge environmental sculpture \"celebrating\" in Karen Cooper's words, \"the gritty glamour and chaotic beauty that is New York City,\" Red and Mimi Grooms hiked and rode through Manhattan, making sketches and taking photographs. Then they collected collaborators and went to work, using tons of hardware, paints, elastic, steel, and fabric.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/ds6uy0PBCVIdCVLhfbNTvdQTfre.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruckus Manhattan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Red Grooms","original_name":"Red Grooms","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ea6b2ae38430047819dba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ds6uy0PBCVIdCVLhfbNTvdQTfre.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://film-makerscoop.com/catalogue/red-grooms-ruckus-manhattan","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
