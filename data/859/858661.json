In Bobok, the narrator, out of boredom, goes to a funeral of a distant relative. Later, taking thought, he lies down on a tombstone and begins to hear the dead, who continue to talk to each other as if by inertia. The authors of the film translate imagery and tone of this story into a ritual action. Abstract space of fabrics, industrial materials, and human body transforms and disintegrates, blurring the line between living and inanimate.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobok","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2247018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Karelina","original_name":"Александра Карелина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d8884b4a5430046b50c43","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1992238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Yakushev","original_name":"Ivan Yakushev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d8893ae3843007519fe71","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1992238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Yakushev","original_name":"Ivan Yakushev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d888ff6fd18005e7d147c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2247018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Karelina","original_name":"Александра Карелина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d8880323eba002fbf3c89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
