Sequences of this performative action are montaged like in a silent movie with panels of cut-up newspaper text blocks, installation shots from the Documenta exhibition inside and outside Fridericianum, and scenes from a horror porn movie based on the story of the serial killer \"Goyo\" Cárdenas – his case became a sensation on Mexican media in the 1940s and inspired several copycat murderers imitating his crimes – and underscored with a dramatic soundtrack. With Robarte el Arte, the artists satirically destabilize Documenta’s institutionalized role to chart the current art developments and thus setting the foundation for a so-called canon as Eurocentric.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robarte el arte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":942065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan José Gurrola","original_name":"Juan José Gurrola","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/9nb2dy3t0enIU3psnttw3uEKOrb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"610ebf2b323eba005ddca67a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gelsen Gas","original_name":"Gelsen Gas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"610ebf365a4690005ff6e7ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2972169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaldo Cohen","original_name":"Arnaldo Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"610ebf4df6fd18005e7f8128","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":942065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan José Gurrola","original_name":"Juan José Gurrola","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/9nb2dy3t0enIU3psnttw3uEKOrb.jpg","credit_id":"610ebf5bdcf875006075be93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gelsen Gas","original_name":"Gelsen Gas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ebf72dcf87500304141a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0427787","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
