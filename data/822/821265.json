Thanks to the rediscovery of the photos taken in 1957 by the young Cancian in that rural village where he had arrived almost by chance, the story resumes there where it was interrupted 60 years earlier. And the thread of memories ties back to people and places, bringing with itself some essential reflections on how photography can become an ethnographic look at small communities.","popularity":0.3259,"poster_path":"/zlR00HmgQGtbbCZAITiTWbkch3r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5x7","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Citoni","original_name":"Michele Citoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60803fe37776f000581fc14a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2901535,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roberto Mencherini","original_name":"Roberto Mencherini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608040627776f0003f6b4bc6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Citoni","original_name":"Michele Citoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60804071d48cee00648d1d8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12392404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"5x7-il-paese-in-una-scatola-361221724536628","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jkcP7pb3qkKvCnxuNOYmkldvUV7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":990,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/zlR00HmgQGtbbCZAITiTWbkch3r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":700,"name":"italian american"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":161276,"name":"anthropologist"},{"id":173989,"name":"old photograph"},{"id":179066,"name":"photo exhibition"},{"id":243323,"name":"south italy"},{"id":248870,"name":"memories"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
