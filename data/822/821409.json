Through the prism of the author's most autobiographical novel, David Copperfield, Armando looks beyond Dickens - the national institution - and instead explores the qualities of Dickens's work that still make him one of the best British writers.  While Dickens is often celebrated for his powerful depictions of Victorian England and his role as a social reformer, this programme foregrounds the elements of his writing which make him worth reading, as much for what he tells us about ourselves in the twenty-first century as our ancestors in the nineteenth.  Armando argues that Dickens's remarkable use of language and his extraordinary gift for creating characters make him a startlingly experimental and psychologically penetrating writer who demands not just to be adapted for television but to be read and read again.","popularity":0.4156,"poster_path":"/9SM8o20PdjdOK9RXzjaR80j2EQA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armando's Tale of Charles Dickens","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Armando Iannucci","original_name":"Armando Iannucci","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/uyDppm3bNkT7Q8Zsirz9Puu3ssX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608462602da8460029808951","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3952018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Arlidge","original_name":"Anthony Arlidge","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64067059160e73007c38d86a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Armando Iannucci","original_name":"Armando Iannucci","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/uyDppm3bNkT7Q8Zsirz9Puu3ssX.jpg","credit_id":"6080a430160e730077199bbc","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835818,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Lee","original_name":"Deborah Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a52cd48cee0051ad8b8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835818,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Lee","original_name":"Deborah Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a54743d9b10057df24be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Basil Comely","original_name":"Basil Comely","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a571c439c0002a3a89d7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062369,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marian Lacey","original_name":"Marian Lacey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a585f92532007c510c31","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062370,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Alkadi","original_name":"Sam Alkadi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a59d56b9f700292d14b1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062372,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brendon Easton","original_name":"Brendon Easton","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a5adf92532002c699c70","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2264704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9SM8o20PdjdOK9RXzjaR80j2EQA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":10818,"name":"author"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
