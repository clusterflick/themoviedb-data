For ten years, he produced at a sustained pace a very significant series of films: Jacques Rivette's Out 1, Marguerite Duras' India Song, Robert Bresson's The Devil Probably, Benoît Jacquot's Closet Children… The freedom of these works entails a relationship with their production circumstances, the quality of the encounters that favored them, the spirit of a time. This film is the portrait of an era as much as of a producer, investigative film or a journey into the past of French author's cinema.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un étrange équipage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Nicot","original_name":"Boris Nicot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607fc37801b1ca005869555a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
