Heat is followed by cold, agitation by calm. When the atmosphere stops diffusing the sun's rays, it lets the stars appear and the true sky, deep, black and unchanging. The short and vivid cycles of earthly life give way to cosmic eternities. This is the moment that a tiny soul, that of a cat, chooses to leave the earthly plane.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/cE25s4UsstOQUF6ctUijMQErjs6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19020,"logo_path":"/iPU4Imo4Y8ipW8jp8zQP0L7xMtb.png","name":"Ecole nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Feat","original_name":"Simon Feat","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080b0a066f2d20040b92db2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r6pubbHNYtOmmNCASYXTdgB7Ni6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c5tnbVhVbqxc06z1K5Wa590S9JU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aAFI03S2AVi0baiLdLUouYZeug2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cE25s4UsstOQUF6ctUijMQErjs6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kA9A8cdvzKtAS8V9JT2pECPQHuE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PASSAGE - Simon Feat","key":"248320786","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-12-21T14:48:57.000Z","id":"6080af708b959e00581b412c"}]}}}
