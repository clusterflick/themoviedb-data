As a single urban individual, you establish a new routine. Waking up late, having breakfast, watching TV, drinking coffee, killing time… Every day is the same. A persistent pigeon keeps coming back to remind the author of what freedom means. In this humorous and beautifully edited short, Luka Marcetic films himself as he spends long and lonely days quarantined at his apartment and dreams of going outside.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/vWK74oyJbmmZwVZQYa4sVZysDN8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luka Marčetič","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2020-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Day Is It?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luka Marčetič","original_name":"Luka Marčetič","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/AgtClZZ4Dru4NjLKqGx1URHVwdY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6086d8858d22fc003f1e9c4b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luka Marčetič","original_name":"Luka Marčetič","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/AgtClZZ4Dru4NjLKqGx1URHVwdY.jpg","credit_id":"60801acf726fb10059b43811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luka Marčetič","original_name":"Luka Marčetič","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/AgtClZZ4Dru4NjLKqGx1URHVwdY.jpg","credit_id":"6086d8412c6b7b002a6fde9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luka Marčetič","original_name":"Luka Marčetič","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/AgtClZZ4Dru4NjLKqGx1URHVwdY.jpg","credit_id":"6086d84833a533006f44db52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13235032","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vWK74oyJbmmZwVZQYa4sVZysDN8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
