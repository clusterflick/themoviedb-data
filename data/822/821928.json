Sun Ma Si-tsang, at once a master Cantonese opera actor and a talented comedian, showcases an oft-overlooked style of singing, presenting it as an inspirational force that saves life and betters relationships. He plays the titled character, who doesn't operate a boat and is nowhere near bodies of water, but an artist specialising in the Dragon Boat style of music. Forced to perform on the streets to make a living, he ventures into situations manifesting the many societal problems that plague Hong Kong, inspiring and elevating common folks with his artistry. He stars alongside Leung Sing-por in a classic animation of comedy partnership, generating laughter from the interactions between players of contrasting body types.","popularity":0.3177,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":153117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wanli Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheung, the Dragon Boatman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sun-Ma Sze-Tsang","original_name":"Sun-Ma Sze-Tsang","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/aQVTgxYdE0oZ1OVSJJohMRyIvRs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dragon Boat Cheung","credit_id":"608239d4839018005871e4f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Sing Poh","original_name":"Leung Sing Poh","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/y3ASIyOIl7G3nbIRR7poGjZzvtq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bo, martial actor","credit_id":"608239e48b959e0040f8b68d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeung Fan","original_name":"Yeung Fan","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cheung Ching","credit_id":"608239f32da846003f13d9e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siu Yin-Fei","original_name":"Siu Yin-Fei","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/vCuq957mvyc4B7zItiqJnh4EvCo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ah Ping","credit_id":"60823a037776f0003f6db9c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Sun-Nam","original_name":"Wong Sun-Nam","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Opera actress Nam","credit_id":"60823a118b959e00581d4fe4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1581279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ma Siu-Ying","original_name":"Ma Siu-Ying","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/vocqq2QEsqxFVdX0R0qT2gjsPho.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cheung's mother","credit_id":"60823a267776f00029917c1e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chan Ching Wah","original_name":"Chan Ching Wah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mistress","credit_id":"60823a38160e7300771be026","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fung Ying-Seung","original_name":"Fung Ying-Seung","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"One Eye Dragon","credit_id":"60823a478390180029a84ec4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheng Wai-Sum","original_name":"Cheng Wai-Sum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60823a5165e0a2003fb749b6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Suet-Ying","original_name":"Cheung Suet-Ying","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60823a5c9e4586002953805f","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698156,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Poon Bing-Kuen","original_name":"Poon Bing-Kuen","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60823ae79a8a8a0041f38377","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698156,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Poon Bing-Kuen","original_name":"Poon Bing-Kuen","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60823adce8601700294dc8d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064133,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Woo Man-Sam","original_name":"Woo Man-Sam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60823afa2da846006e3961dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1952-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
