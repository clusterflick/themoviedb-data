From the harrowing imagery of the riots and looting to the impassioned protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, the viewers are taken on a ground-level experience of a modern-day uprising.  With the United States in near-unspeakable partisan divide, this film brings out the incredible humanity of those calling for change, while also showing the reality of the trenches.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A spark ignites and the country was never the same","title":"Ignited States","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062371,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jourdan Gomez","original_name":"Jourdan Gomez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a5a0f6787a0040449cae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jud Nichols","original_name":"Jud Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a591f92532007c510c5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jud Nichols","original_name":"Jud Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a584955c65007aa1da1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jud Nichols","original_name":"Jud Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a5c1f92532005a9bc6ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Chase","original_name":"Matt Chase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a5b5f9253200435aac22","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Chase","original_name":"Matt Chase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080a5ce2b8a430057f37f33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cleveland International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IGNITED STATES - TRAILER (2020)","key":"1ixl4ogW4_c","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-19T18:03:09.000Z","id":"6080a5240f0da50040bcc2de"}]}}}
