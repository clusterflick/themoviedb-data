Back then, Bellingen was a rundown, quiet country town with business in decline. Then, new ideas, new ways of living and a new status quo began to take control. What some called an influx of hippies, others called an invasion on the conservative lifestyle of farmers, causing a clash of ideals.  Compiling countless hours of 8mm footage and historical photos, retired journo Peter Geddes and filmmaker Peter Gailley paint the historical landscape of how modern Bellingen came to be, following the cultural movement that eventually became the backbone of Bellingenâ€™s identity.","popularity":1.0819,"poster_path":"/b26tnnO6lq13IzZfX0YHdabyunc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Untold Story of Bellingen's Hippie History.","title":"BELLINGEN: The Promised Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061637,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Gailley","original_name":"Peter Gailley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6080068b8b959e006f1da144","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Geddes","original_name":"Peter Geddes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60800677955c65002bd1f15e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"2PGFilmProductions2020","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b26tnnO6lq13IzZfX0YHdabyunc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11660,"name":"hippie lifestyle"},{"id":12192,"name":"counter-culture"},{"id":226452,"name":"regional"},{"id":227533,"name":"new south wales"},{"id":246197,"name":"country  town"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"SWIFF 2021 Screenwave International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BELLINGEN the PROMISED LAND  final 6min  trailer","key":"TKleC4gpGA0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-16T01:12:20.000Z","id":"608007ac2b8a430057f2d208"}]}}}
