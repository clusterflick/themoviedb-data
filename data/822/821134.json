Hundreds of thousands of people in Montenegro stood up for the conciliar prayer led by Metropolitan Amfilohiy (Radovic). During his ministry, the Metropolitan, together with his people, built and restored 700 churches and monasteries. Through the life line of Metropolitan Amfilochiy, we want to tell about the long-suffering Serbian land. About life and monasticism in Montenegro. Unexpectedly for everyone, a national shepherd dies from the coronavirus. But his prayers have been answered. On the fortieth day after the death of Vladyka, the government changes and introduces amendments to the bill on the Church. This means that there will be no split.","popularity":0.0864,"poster_path":"/nZXVRr7wKmKZcgQf8hy1Yk188Kr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swallows of Christ","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Lastochki Khristovy","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3061632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Bocharova","original_name":"Юлия Бочарова","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608002b301b1ca0077a8f754","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3061632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Bocharova","original_name":"Юлия Бочарова","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b1096ae2ff3200690d5a0d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3061632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Bocharova","original_name":"Юлия Бочарова","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b109701684f70042a41ae9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3340755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yury Tseytlin","original_name":"Yury Tseytlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b1098776eecf009325bc8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3340756,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandr Matrosov","original_name":"Alexandr Matrosov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b109cb6dea3a004144c9dc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16590138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/257HLmLZjwJOkDRNBjjerFrkG46.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zFqKvxDsLaQQ228w7kZNoaxjJL1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/nZXVRr7wKmKZcgQf8hy1Yk188Kr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/ssInz5exbreEWPZh7LnUzy5ig5k.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival Russian Programs","release_date":"2021-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
