It started surprisingly, because Malika was supposed to get together with a different young man she’d met online. But it’s all for the best, because the two students feel an instant connection.

Jérémie Picard’s Small Talk is a charming bottle film – a no-frills portrait of budding love in the time of COVID.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/pMY8AWtuTkJDefCJpwQvndZCAQQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purple Skies Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Talk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Louis Laurin","original_name":"François Louis Laurin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6081e492160e7300583a3758","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeane Landry-Proulx","original_name":"Jeane Landry-Proulx","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6081e49d7776f0005821cd6a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérémie Picard","original_name":"Jérémie Picard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cSZq5wjbq3xdt1nXhRzkwoFyJfC.jpg","credit_id":"6081e4b09a8a8a00589681d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071491,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bastien Blancho","original_name":"Bastien Blancho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a0c2e43250f0057288433","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071492,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Milan Otis","original_name":"Milan Otis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a0c699d89390077c81aa4","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie-Ève Albert","original_name":"Marie-Ève Albert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wIc0Fx0P6uoeDi4Ck4YMIWPLkpY.jpg","credit_id":"608a0c045b2f47005897e115","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071493,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chloé Brooks","original_name":"Chloé Brooks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a0ccd5b2f4700414148dc","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578004,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Paulius Valinskas","original_name":"Paulius Valinskas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608a0c1967e0f70029d6ead0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14207212","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1341,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fuP5WUd1S8cfZMV6fmCLqSTxmuv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2384},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1341,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7G8m57U36v5pSoNDWCnXIcHeB9T.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2384}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pMY8AWtuTkJDefCJpwQvndZCAQQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"RVQC","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
