Now re-sited in a forsaken Europe, in a world which echoes Apocalypse Now, what emerges is a tale absolutely for our time.  This bold re-telling of the Conrad classic is a visually rich, multi-layered work which fuses live performance with digital technology.  The performers enter the stage, into uncharted territory. They are adrift with a story that they know they must tell. As they wait for the turn of the tide, the story unfolds like an animated Cinemascope graphic novel on the hanging projections screens above their heads.  The heart of darkness must be found. The story is impossible to tell, but it must be told.  Presented by imitating the dog. Heart of Darkness is co-produced with Marche Teatro (Italy) and Cast. Supported by Arts Council England, Lancaster Arts at Lancaster University and Theatre by the Lake.","popularity":0.151,"poster_path":"/mEkvtXPtx0MbK7UCAnbDQprCJRo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Prendergast","original_name":"Matt Prendergast","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/o0ky75sJuUgmdrKLrBTB4PzA32k.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kurtz","credit_id":"664897f188821f7e162f859e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keicha Greenidge","original_name":"Keicha Greenidge","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marlowe","credit_id":"66489825a87b2ea0a365d2e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4115110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Bailey","original_name":"Morgan Bailey","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":"/5xM5Phlmr0rtUAktxT8EISzSMuR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664898d4a87b2ea0a365d2fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4721010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Atherton","original_name":"Laura Atherton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664898e45e39a926b095b7e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":487390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morven Macbeth","original_name":"Morven Macbeth","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/tr8CEUlZrgKItAHDKSj08dkQIdT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6648999e82e0c772262f7a96","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Conrad","original_name":"Joseph Conrad","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/7dmPuMaghnQZYLoKWdrBPJFTL7c.jpg","credit_id":"664899937509698a011d4cd3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mEkvtXPtx0MbK7UCAnbDQprCJRo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
