It was created as part of my dance research \"Energy and Matter\" in which I looked into dance as a transformation of energy and as a process of exchange of qualities between human and other material bodies. I perceive it as an investigation into life, viewed through the lens of breath and matter.Through movement and vocal improvisation, themes such as the confrontation with mortality, the experience of time, as well as the redefinition of our relationship with ourselves emerged during this exploration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BREARTH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4720903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stella Dimitrakopoulou","original_name":"Stella Dimitrakopoulou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664874989b2ab1229c65d086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
