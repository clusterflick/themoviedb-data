Jukembayev, who holds a record of 22-1 with 16 knockouts, is currently on a four-fight win streak, with two of those victories secured on ProBox TV. Originally hailing from Shu, Kazakhstan, Jukembayev aims to achieve the most significant win of his career in this upcoming fight. His sole defeat came at the hands of IBF junior welterweight champion Subriel Matias.  Redkach, possessing a 24-6-1 record with 19 knockouts, now resides in Los Angeles, California, though he is originally from Ukraine. A seasoned veteran, Redkach returned to the ring last July after a two-year hiatus. Having previously faced top-tier opponents such as Regis Prograis and Danny Garcia without securing a victory, Redkach is determined to alter his fortunes against Jukembayev.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":"/2H3LYHfOGWAgG9Xi31b8qUD6AkQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181850,"logo_path":"/x42f5qYMqWEFqtKXTyh7Y4JmsSV.png","name":"ProBox TV","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Batyrzhan Jukembayev vs. Ivan Redkach","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Batyrzhan Jukembayev","original_name":"Batyrzhan Jukembayev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ky84YOnaNy7uBGYHy7mk19UkGzQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b388b0d66df01ca933cb8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4243418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Redkach","original_name":"Ivan Redkach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/46n2Qu8r9vjRn3TWKZmD7FjIROB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b38930d6cd6f50f2fe755","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Harris Jr","original_name":"Charles Harris Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ywQqE5iGFZEZSGPoFZlfgVcQLRm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b44ffe34f62032a547f5a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4724690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Erwin","original_name":"Kyle Erwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AWm1dRcucnQMI8UKp5RJwGoD5x.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b450773cdb44bbf2febc3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4111671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonhatan Cardoso","original_name":"Jonhatan Cardoso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3tXXUx3PiBYUMr290Ofvnym9cT6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b451078cfc88a206657ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Lopez","original_name":"Adam Lopez","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/5PCekNU3Jd58YIzgkvcmNpUpzq2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b451b658beb2b0696304b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4724691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Tillman","original_name":"Adrian Tillman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b45240d66df01ca933d20","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4724692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayleen Bullock","original_name":"Jayleen Bullock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b452b86e451913589ca3d","order":7}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ydqc4cRnhFliTQLHMa6EIE15p8i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mmq7VFcqi1SjHrgUTOT28bHchV9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2H3LYHfOGWAgG9Xi31b8qUD6AkQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209476,"name":"boxing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
