Film star mansions give way to tatty motels; exclusive offices stand alongside nightclubs with aspiring comics, and amateur nude contests. Then the famous ‘strip’ and Hollywood’s legendary coffee shop, Schwabs, where (they say) a girl in a tight sweater turned into Lana Turner.  Meet some of Sunset’s most colourful and improbable residents – the failed showbiz impresario who made his millions selling cookies, and the high-rise developer who let John Wayne take his cow up in the lift… the lucky ones have achieved a peculiarly Hollywood brand of success, but every day on Sunset you meet the other ones: still looking for a break, for a job, for a deal. All of them still trying to play their part in the Hollywood dream.","popularity":0.9157,"poster_path":"/5xk0IPwSLkawrO2JLbhvZxaLvAb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161115,"logo_path":"/d1iQlbHJAupXh5oEo4zpRtM09vc.png","name":"BBC TV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Brooks","original_name":"Mel Brooks","popularity":1.4623,"profile_path":"/c21qNcMJlHnRolfhQhZOVacjtwI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66493635b142517b697c7187","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hurt","original_name":"John Hurt","popularity":2.001,"profile_path":"/bjNSzt1d7uK3q5PbtFXUJrRt4qg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66493641ff9ef892828e805a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Vartan","original_name":"Sylvie Vartan","popularity":0.3513,"profile_path":"/sRfjllo2PRonRgqeVorIq5REmsW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66493647ddbb1ab83d791fbf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jana Boková","original_name":"Jana Boková","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/19QpU1bvkRZvHbXac7RpUyR1Tfu.jpg","credit_id":"66493627e2ea0743a41d41c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","credit_id":"664b19fb59b31045c6546d7b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088205","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5xk0IPwSLkawrO2JLbhvZxaLvAb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
