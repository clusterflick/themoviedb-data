Shusui speculates that powerful people in the Date family and the shogunate are planning to overthrow the shogunate using buried gold and gets excited about a major national crisis.  He gets separated from Osuke due to interference but with the help of his sister Kikuji  and others he tracks down Osuke's whereabouts. He then realizes that Osuke is not from the Fujiwara family but is actually the daughter of Edo elder Itakura Shōken who has been confined under the pretext of an epidemic disease.  Having promised to help Osuke, Shusui goes up to Edo Castle and advises shogun Tsunayoshi not to visit Nikkō Tōshō-gū Shrine which has been restored by Date family because \"evil spirits are attached\". However, Tsunayoshi is furious and orders him to stay under house arrest.","popularity":0.4094,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Notorious Bored Samurai 6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3526178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoko Kawai","original_name":"Naoko Kawai","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664b0bced78c893d412c9ca1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kinya Kitaoji","original_name":"北大路欣也","popularity":0.7425,"profile_path":"/dCm2nipPsxKqJv5fwVcaIBOFkTa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sawatari Shusui","credit_id":"664b0bd2c29e44eb9dcc8494","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1608493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiro Komura","original_name":"古村比呂","popularity":0.1588,"profile_path":"/8vTz9XU83VbAXEwWjv3N7k7MnyK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kikuji","credit_id":"664b0bd6c476faa0b9dfc25f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyuki Nagato","original_name":"長門裕之","popularity":0.5302,"profile_path":"/4mRLJoy4qPoMiGmPnOGmhjCU7Hg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Shogun Tsunayoshi","credit_id":"664b0bdbfd41d53caff2a5a2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jō Shishido","original_name":"宍戸錠","popularity":0.6001,"profile_path":"/3ScqByWgflF202OskqSQkDB0lnP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"664b0be1e2ea0743a41dccf9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chikako Kaku","original_name":"賀来千香子","popularity":0.5894,"profile_path":"/xo8GSUwIWX0zIIC6vhHiT5GRpte.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Osuke","credit_id":"664b0bef32174daa802c9ff7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akinori Matsuo","original_name":"松尾昭典","popularity":0.4649,"profile_path":"/7Gaf0RPWIuok3liNpbKHcIt11Fw.jpg","credit_id":"664b0b983909b048288fa6bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shigeko Matsudaira","original_name":"松平繁子","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664b0baf9b2ab1229c665aaf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373370,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mitsuzō Sasaki","original_name":"佐々木味津三","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664b0bbd82e0c772262ff051","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32142603","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4HpZR4nOsORdR0NHVGBVALA3YK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186753,"name":"jidaigeki"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1991-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
