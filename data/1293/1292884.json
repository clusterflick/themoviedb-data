Vignettes from Rivera’s life in both Mexico and California—including raucous parties, punk clubs, drag performances, political protests, intimate moments with artist friends, family, and more—are elegantly edited together in a nonlinear fashion by filmmaker Pablo Bujosa Rodríguez, to present a nostalgia-free look back at the late ’90s, and the characters, music, and cities that make up a life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fistful of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
