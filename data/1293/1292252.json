Seeking refuge in excessive parties and alcohol, Gitte risks losing the one thing that keeps her going: her children. As Gina fights against the backdrop of generational poverty, neglect, and lovelessness, she refuses to accept that her fate is predetermined by her birthplace. This is a three-generation family portrait told through the eyes of a determined nine-year-old girl, who is determined to break the cycle and find stability and hope amidst the challenges of her upbringing.","popularity":0.2628,"poster_path":"/7y1DD7PKFMzjsCgn98ChZAx8XE5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142011,"logo_path":"/cmFPc4XsZuFhvkCKKwiHM9YxSll.png","name":"Film
