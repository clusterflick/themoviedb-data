This is the second recreated version of the film. \"I was 13 and had seen the amazing \"abstract jazz claymation: short, CLAY, OR THE ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES by Eliot Noyes. I was totally copying that film when I made this. I entered this film in a local high school film festival, won first place, and got the attention of Larry Herndon of Keitz and Herndon, a Dallas animation company. Herndon set me up with a 35mm camera and professional lights, and had me reshoot the claymation. By this time, I had forgotten about Nosey' film and that I had simply imitated it. So, for the 35mm second version, I THOUGHT I was just imitating myself. That second WAD was entered (by the National Information Agency, a branch of the CIA) in foreign amateur film festivals all over the world and won yet more awards.\"","popularity":0.1153,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wad and the Worm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4721760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Stang","original_name":"Ivan Stang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66490161d27d068aec58cf3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":197065,"name":"claymation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
