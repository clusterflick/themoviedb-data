They talk about their personal experiences and the way they have reacted to certain situations in the past. They also explore the process by which arguments begin and escalate with some role play situations: at a dinner table, in a playground, on a park bench, and finding a lost purse full of money. The video was entirely filmed, devised and edited by girls from the Gough Grove community, with THAP (Tower Hamlets Arts Project).","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Arguments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
