However, Armando.info journalists discovered that the powdered milk included was deficient in calcium and high in sodium. Investigations revealed Alex Saab, a government contractor, was behind the overpriced imports. Journalist Roberto Deniz exposed Saab’s corruption and fled to Colombia due to threats. From there, he uncovered Saab's money laundering for Maduro and bribes to opposition members. Saab was arrested in Cape Verde and extradited to the US. Saab must choose to collaborate with US authorities or face trial, while Deniz, in exile, continues his reporting despite personal risks.","popularity":0.8276,"poster_path":"/sb53ccvSpGiuglMIsDexbFK4II9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontline Production Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2024-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dangerous Assignment: Uncovering Corruption in Maduro’s Venezuela","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4724601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto deniz","original_name":"Roberto deniz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664b23ef38f6c96fcedfbacd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4285188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Ravell","original_name":"Juan Ravell","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/52g5OWuDYq8rt9c4nmP5x7bRHeE.jpg","credit_id":"664b2448c29e44eb9dcc8580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4285188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Ravell","original_name":"Juan Ravell","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/52g5OWuDYq8rt9c4nmP5x7bRHeE.jpg","credit_id":"664b245f9b2ab1229c665bca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546953,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saul Guanipa","original_name":"Saul Guanipa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651ea9279b6135a62a6ad8e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4735361,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Alvares Galez","original_name":"Pedro Alvares Galez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651e96cb91cda359a99a869","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391967,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elias Serpa","original_name":"Elias Serpa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651eaa0af0d0e218626f1e2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Arak","original_name":"Jeff Arak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651e957bf07278011960ff2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1424494,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raney Aronson-Rath","original_name":"Raney Aronson-Rath","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6651e99e79bfaed335c12d6a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31027510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ECcAfTHzsAr5FHlLMzubo1VxyT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1110,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iET4jcrSpagtiJUB7SpiymgTwq8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1974}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sb53ccvSpGiuglMIsDexbFK4II9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":417,"name":"corruption"},{"id":430,"name":"venezuela"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Youtube","release_date":"2024-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Dangerous Assignment: Uncovering Corruption in Maduro’s Venezuela (full documentary) | FRONTLINE","key":"BgzTAG_Vhn4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2024-05-15T03:23:00.000Z","id":"664b25778cc017b9908fa796"}]}}}
