When he's not working at the bowling shop he's studying YouTube videos, playing 20 games a week as a member of four active leagues, and memorizing the characteristics of each of the 48 lanes at his regular bowling alley. Yet despite all of Bill's determination, he has yet to achieve his dream of going pro. One seeming ordinary night all may change for this underdog as Fong begins to get strike after strike, nearing the ever elusive 'perfect series,' a feat only achieved 21 times since 1895. The achievement would be historical, the first for Texas and the first by an Asian-American. A perfect series could be just the thing to launch Bill into the pros but will he be able to make it or buckle under the pressure?","popularity":0.2063,"poster_path":"/1wXv1cS6XGtlw5IHUuG9glawz27.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coffee and Celluloid Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strike: The Greatest Bowling Story Ever Told","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3839794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Fong","original_name":"Bill Fong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"main","credit_id":"63a2e51cbcf8c9007d5ee01e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1759614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joey Daoud","original_name":"Joey Daoud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aZGINSsVqVgxfRLAret7rpi5wuG.jpg","credit_id":"63a2e54b8ddc3414c4438394","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3351036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8rSoSKrJS5ZbetEV2YVDtiNEj6x.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u75MY3HkHu9iCJZOsyu1SJjtLkA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dReyTuEXMmcYz2i1G6dFOMdETL5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1wXv1cS6XGtlw5IHUuG9glawz27.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":730},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5gYBCuvJ20HxKQgddB7Qh8RMEAw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":420,"name":"bowling"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Strike: The Greatest Bowling Story Ever Told | Made With Kickstarter | The New York Times","key":"ULaCMJlW4Ow","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-03-10T22:11:02.000Z","id":"67c8c0069264aa58666e4f43"}]}}}
