There, she undergoes a training to recover her strained voice which she has harmed from both her strenuous job as a primary school teacher and her toxic relationship with her partner. While wandering around San Sebastian, she meets people who each show her their work: a woman who makes poetry books by hand, a group of retired people who make dolls for an annual Christmas stall and a researcher who investigates the pollution on leaves in the city park. Slowly, her personal way of looking at the world and the people takes more form and she starts to speak up.","popularity":0.0451,"poster_path":"/5VuO7xotGcuBNFeanhGLax5rPb0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Voice","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3143247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Pacifique","original_name":"Naomi Pacifique","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Natu","credit_id":"63c5504ba6725400e92fd53e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marieke Elzerman","original_name":"Marieke Elzerman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a322304f33ad008c025b1d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marieke Elzerman","original_name":"Marieke Elzerman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3221851f99a34d2290d8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3108093,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Artur-Pol Camprubí","original_name":"Artur-Pol Camprubí","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/A0oUrr3fHXlTPnpfbHLsQUjOhaG.jpg","credit_id":"63c55095595a5600bbe1e3c0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marieke Elzerman","original_name":"Marieke Elzerman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c550db5f2b8d007d66ae91","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24860614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5VuO7xotGcuBNFeanhGLax5rPb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
