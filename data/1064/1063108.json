Each strand may be unique in length and texture but they are said to bear our memories of sorrow and worry. Neighbors come to the old shop “Barber’s Time” to part with both their hair and bad memories.  Although Cantonese style haircutting is on the slippery slope to extinction, barber shop owner Hoi-chuen wishes for his son Cheung-fat to manage the shop. Aspiring to be a writer like J. D. Salinger instead, Cheung-fat takes over “Barber’s Time” when his father had an accident. Just like his father, Cheung-fat develops rapport with the customers and provides guidance. His own life also turns around when a runaway girl comes to the shop. A magical heartwarming tale of community support and kindness, the short features Kaki Shum from the film “Weeds of Fire”.","popularity":0.0851,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2017-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory in The Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sham Ka-Ki","original_name":"岑珈其","popularity":0.3933,"profile_path":"/8fHdK9loa7tKDXBLZ6QFIjjvYo3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"639fdc3e223e2000c981b1cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1992420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Leung","original_name":"梁雍婷","popularity":0.2242,"profile_path":"/frTVaV1U4KqPeHwSnoeB1JorUtw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"639fdc474f33ad00d533a3a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2732132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifford Tsang Man-Wai","original_name":"Clifford Tsang Man-Wai","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639fdc672f3b1700ba0426fd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3836795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chu Siu-fung","original_name":"Chu Siu-fung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639fdc824f33ad00d533a3d2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3836796,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pong Ho-wai","original_name":"Pong Ho-wai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639fdc8ff44f2700e00d23de","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3836795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chu Siu-fung","original_name":"Chu Siu-fung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639fdc7a4f33ad008456411a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
