A small crow, alone and without a nest, wanders everywhere to find a place and food. But he does not have an appearance that is desirable for people to give him a seed, nor does he have a lovely voice to endear him with. He does a lot to be accepted and liked, but everything leads him to be a black crow. Until, in this mood, he watches an event in the city square and a new decision comes to his mind to reach bread and shelter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bazgasht","title":"Bazgasht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2723477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vajiollah Fard-e-Moghadam","original_name":"Vajiollah Fard-e-Moghadam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a178282f3b1700e6daad3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
