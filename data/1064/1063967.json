Beginning with a history lesson for the model train hobby and then transitioning into a how-to film on creating one's own model train fantasy layout, the film takes a turn as the lead character becomes fully engulfed in the fantasy world of model railroading. Between a full-on dancing girls extravaganza to an \"edge of your seat\" action film, the film proves that playing with trains is a form of pure escapism for kids of every age.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Model Railroading Unlimited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Harper","original_name":"Rick Harper","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a30d8d2f3b170094cb8759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1791552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
