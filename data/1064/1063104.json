They must be sent out within forty-nine days following their masters’ death, or end their unfulfilled existence as waste paper. Old Mr. Yeung, owner of the zhizha shop, is determined to keep the artisan trade alive. Yet with the old neighbourhood being redeveloped, the shop’s business dwindles along with the chance for the kind-hearted Lo-mui and Kam-lo, two paper dolls crafted by old Mr. Yeung, to find a master. The dolls hatch a plan to escape in a race against time before their demise.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":"/iPkHUQ9RdAfJMoP21IYJoU4MZ0C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Manual of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2229779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buber Mak","original_name":"Buber Mak","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/utoOcmOf1WEOkA4mfl2dG8yOHc6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"639fd4d22f3b170085dbd9c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3836781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mak Chi-man","original_name":"Mak Chi-man","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"639fd4e78ddc3414969bfb83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"So Chun-Wai","original_name":"So Chun-Wai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639fd4f2688cd01790d896ea","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2229779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buber Mak","original_name":"Buber Mak","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/utoOcmOf1WEOkA4mfl2dG8yOHc6.jpg","credit_id":"639fd4fd223e2000835a2bcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2229779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buber Mak","original_name":"Buber Mak","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/utoOcmOf1WEOkA4mfl2dG8yOHc6.jpg","credit_id":"639fd5054f33ad0084563c0c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3836782,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"WONG Wai-yip","original_name":"WONG Wai-yip","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639fd527f44f27007c97873c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmen Wan","original_name":"Carmen Wan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639fd561da10f0007de78fda","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iPkHUQ9RdAfJMoP21IYJoU4MZ0C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1451}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
