Arrived at the end of a long journey, exhausted, they do not know if they could settle down somewhere to start their life over. It is this transitional time that \"The Adventure\" tells. Ossoul, the Sudanese poet, Mamadou, survivor of an icy night at the Col de l'Échelle, Charlotte, Mother Courage and others are gradually getting back on their feet and settling to embark on a new life. Filmed over three years, \"L'Aventure\" is a story of resilience, friendships and revealed emotions. The portraits are drawn and deepened until everyone can recognize themselves in the other, put themselves in their place and understand them.","popularity":0.3271,"poster_path":"/qsgWoGxN4VkJc48ICLWgjGi9pCn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188673,"logo_path":"/kEVRIvQsrmMECfv9odhB07jOxhz.png","name":"HelloAsso","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Aventure","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"639fc8b82f3b1700e6d9d3b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20713,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Bernet","original_name":"Olivier Bernet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639fcaaf223e2000a8b4cfcb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"639fcad9f44f2700a2ac6047","department":"Production","job":"Delegated Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"639fc8ae4f33ad00a2b12020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"639fcabc2f3b1700a0108849","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ehhLR36LgAYO4laHx4402TwOzW8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/do6kGw5ZK0dgRwPpa4tjBxnI4vx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8kCtsvr2ohum3QmqNGTZ83uXJQo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsgWoGxN4VkJc48ICLWgjGi9pCn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1577,"name":"solidarity"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":233691,"name":"refugee crisis"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":297921,"name":"militantism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
