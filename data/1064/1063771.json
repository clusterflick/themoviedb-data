Rather, it addresses the larger cultural myth that has grown from the premise of the book: a white man ‘civilising’ indigenous inhabitants of an island, and claiming the territory as his own property. In a time today when the call to decolonise the artworld and its associated institutions has never been more urgent, Deboosere's cinematic intervention resonates with a large body of work seeking to destabilise and replace the ideology of imperialism. The result is a singular, subversive film, satirical and surprisingly charming at the same time, which makes sure to pay just as much attention to animals and the natural world as to the follies of human-constructed ‘anthropocene’ history.","popularity":0.2336,"poster_path":"/uq6XcmNCZN30NihSJPCIS2UgOf7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Untitled Production","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":180410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hilife Cinematography","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe Who Lived for Twenty and Eight Years All Alone on an Inhabited Island and Said It Was His","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Robinson Crusoe Is a Dick","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oriana Ikomo","original_name":"Oriana Ikomo","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Robinson Crusoe","credit_id":"63da815d955c65008c7c3b9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Leming","original_name":"Bernice Leming","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Friday","credit_id":"63da816a85702e051c4420a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Pembe","original_name":"Blanche Pembe","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/i7bcm4d4f7QCkhvCNUYDVv8o2KZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The English Captain","credit_id":"63da817b22df2e00843cbdd9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2527319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Deboosere","original_name":"Benjamin Deboosere","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xS6KbtKGj3EHhOz2YuqbqyHArmY.jpg","credit_id":"63a2513a4f33ad008c01f29a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26237572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nXY1dJxCkedJ2GF5M4VPh72UVrC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uq6XcmNCZN30NihSJPCIS2UgOf7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
