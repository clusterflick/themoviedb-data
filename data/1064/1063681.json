Instead of a linear narrative, Nummer achttien is structured as a series of movements: it departs from the classical documentary to present us with a series of vignettes that combine past and present, existentialist despair and deadpan humour, reflection and creativity, the joys and pains of remembering and forgetting.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/z96p3oKyDCY81aWKPjrxjAtM2Yw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smarthouse
