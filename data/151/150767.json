The story concerns what happens when he receives a very good manuscript from Nicholas, an old friend, who up until now has been a hack writer. The manuscript sheds light on events both men lived through, and Edward comes to the conviction that it reveals that it was Nicholas who raped the woman Edward loved, and that he is therefore responsible for her subsequent suicide. Very carefully, he plots his revenge.","popularity":0.5088,"poster_path":"/kmsf0DYmMtEj6dvr2I11Ixn2C38.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3417,"logo_path":null,"name":"CTV
