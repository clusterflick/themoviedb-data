That “ne’er-do-well-ness” proved “Kharitonov’s special key to audiences’ hearts”. Following Brovkin’s appearance on the screen, Kharitonov had become a star of the national cinema, an idol for millions of people. His incredible popularity may be compared to that of another national hero – the world’s first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. And not surprisingly, it was Kharitonov who made a cameo appearance going up the festival stairs and followed with the adoring eyes of the heroines in V. Menshov’s Oscar-winning melodrama “Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears”.","popularity":0.4321,"poster_path":"/nUHnk7rZi4YQxgzBjgHVLGDO4Oo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1955-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soldier Ivan Brovkin","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Private Ivan","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Soldat Ivan Brovkin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Kharitonov","original_name":"Леонид Харитонов","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/tMd2TZwZ4d1xxk6cwd5BAAu5SQC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ivan Romanovich Brovkin","credit_id":"52fe4ad59251416c910c746d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Blinnikov","original_name":"Сергей Блинников","popularity":0.2124,"profile_path":"/5dRCYSVwTNj9iKOhoBgqA5GWLgo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Farm Chm.
