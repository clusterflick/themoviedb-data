He has an important law practice, a beautiful secretary as his lover, and the chance to be appointed to the high court. The only thing wrong with this is that his shrewish wife Olivia, whose father made all the wealth and all the power, is living and that greatly upsets Charlie. So when his lover, Laura, suggests that they get rid of Olivia, Charlie thinks, being a lawyer, that he can create a fool-proof plan. In this plan, he must incorporate a woman named Victoria whom he detests, but she can help him get into the court and be part of the plan for Olivia. But dreams of judgeship, money and Laura makes him proceed. However, things never turn out as planned and he may not be as smart as he considers himself.","popularity":2.4736,"poster_path":"/mIG46prDlrKdxl9nOnZ1wEqAcX6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead in the Water","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Brown","original_name":"Bryan Brown","popularity":1.6821,"profile_path":"/x0NqVqpJSET0oVdJxbbwwd7hrFA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charlie Deegan","credit_id":"55f734889251416f87000008","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teri Hatcher","original_name":"Teri Hatcher","popularity":1.6598,"profile_path":"/ySmnfZm8ZGabcwp4UwaMDeSzXqx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Laura Stewart","credit_id":"55f7349992514123ea000d51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne DeSalvo","original_name":"Anne DeSalvo","popularity":0.2331,"profile_path":"/1ajM4cei3izJOCZhJWFKnjhdgpI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Olivia Deegan","credit_id":"55f734a89251415852002201","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Cartwright","original_name":"Veronica Cartwright","popularity":2.6736,"profile_path":"/wIqQnSU4HJLYS2JE4S6jjyb2jMP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Victoria Haines","credit_id":"55f734cac3a3686d0b00bd51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seymour Cassel","original_name":"Seymour Cassel","popularity":0.4212,"profile_path":"/3xAx3mu2VxpTIgdYe9RmSpyVwjH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lt.
