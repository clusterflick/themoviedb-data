The face remains deathly still other than the occasional blink or involuntary bat of his eyelash. The film is slowed down to about 24-frames per-second to capture these slight movements a bit better, but other than this and the choppy fade-in’s and out’s at the beginning and end respectively, nothing changes throughout the film.","popularity":0.1479,"poster_path":"/kxfUvZ8edp487WiqyV71ncK1D9Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andy Warhol Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Screen Test: Helmut","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut","original_name":"Helmut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d1fec7194d8a849843f2e84","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad99251416c910c7d57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Morrissey","original_name":"Paul Morrissey","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/BHsQtEW3RGmDY6RZsaXCuJa8z9.jpg","credit_id":"5c4648e40e0a26496bc832e3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"5c4648ee9251410e1b4f61bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8839956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mEZY2Bvob89ygVNHm7bWWbA6Y8o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1374}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kxfUvZ8edp487WiqyV71ncK1D9Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
