But far from a John Wayne, this hero is caught and brutally beaten and left to die, only to be saved by a prostitute that has also suffered under the hand of this group of desperados. The only one possible to stand up to the shooter is another solitary man who joins with the notorious family although he is deputized as the town's sherif.","popularity":2.0068,"poster_path":"/6q0jdPDPE9uKpRUw8px3zoJtQnm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amritraj / Stevens Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":21304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cabin Fever Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":11130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Oaks Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shooter","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"The Shooter - Der Scharfsch端tze","type":"TV"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Deadly Shooter","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Scharfsch端tze - The Shooter","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Shooter - Der Scharfsch端tze","type":"TV"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Scharfsch端tze","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Dudikoff","original_name":"Michael Dudikoff","popularity":0.6821,"profile_path":"/mj8wZ5Ov8ZAjvUBfIxVf4oADogh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michael Atherton","credit_id":"53cb23670e0a265dfc000d34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Travis","original_name":"Randy Travis","popularity":0.532,"profile_path":"/bsMAHWzgDwTg1s3VUZZcPyGM8ub.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kyle Tapert","credit_id":"53cb23820e0a265ded000dc4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Wildman","original_name":"Valerie Wildman","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/kSfMW2Il9ZBQzFHQzBkH73YCS8x.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Wendy","credit_id":"53cb23ae0e0a265dea000d68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Stevens","original_name":"Andrew Stevens","popularity":0.7212,"profile_path":"/6j3lBX2klVHVfZg5fMJfpxEyc7z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jacob Finch / Narrator","credit_id":"53cb23db0e0a265dfc000d4b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Smith","original_name":"William Smith","popularity":1.619,"profile_path":"/iyIc5xoLPzcy73nQWIZH2nlTarg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jerry Krants","credit_id":"54846d0bc3a3685d0500074f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Lawson","original_name":"Eric Lawson","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/hc3F1bqqlBGbci7gJhy3iQpquQ9.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"616adf645a99150065ec70cc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Donavan","original_name":"Robert Donavan","popularity":0.1692,"profile_path":"/61aRNCMA27E8TkC3IiASDZePIoR.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Mayor Pete Sayers","credit_id":"616adf6f037264002cce57b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cal Bartlett","original_name":"Cal Bartlett","popularity":0.3292,"profile_path":"/c2AfPZPN53O89gBLQtK7sNsmvqo.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"616adf7b90dde00042ce9ae1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew R.
