Day breaks. A woman touches her eyebrows. A man shaves. Chickens are set loose and goats are fed. Little or nothing is said but the soundtrack gradually evolves into a rich, subtle combination of background noise and added sounds. This observation takes on a more contemplative mood, when attention is focused on the other subjects of the film.","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of a day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosana Matecki","original_name":"Rosana Matecki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ade9251416c910c86f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2500830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Historia de un día Trailer","key":"PeCpvzPjfuU","published_at":"2010-05-08T01:14:31.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f9c3a3685448009ad2"}]}}}
