With her gift of the gab and her determination to fight her way out, she finds herself at the top of a small ponzi scheme that promises to be lucrative, but very soon the mechanism seizes up and a sense of control gives way to anxiety.  With a sense of narrative sequencing akin to his senior, Jafar Panahi (The Circle, Blood and Gold), Mahmoud Ghaffari portrays a protagonist hemmed in by a double straightjacket, one where social and gender inequality are inextricably intertwined. His character is neither a heroine nor the passive victim of a crushing system but warrior-like yet evanescent. Arguably, this determination, which draws its energy from despair, can be seen as an obligation incumbent on any filmmaker practising their art in today’s Iran: the obligation to fight up to the point where one’s very absence leaves a void full of meaning.","popularity":0.1181,"poster_path":"/ttR25GRj2XmlZu1WlVSijoj570A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2012-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1619957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elham Korda","original_name":"Elham Korda","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/jnYFFXgiKjW3O3R091Uv0Yhbug.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0b66b10e0a2649bdca3893","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2505096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hadis Miramini","original_name":"Hadis Mir Amini","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/lTUWRadLF3B4Ma7Ef4gcbjBSQyc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d71f425963ebffde7c0b14","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mahmoud Ghaffari","original_name":"Mahmoud Ghaffari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aed9251416c910ca4f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2772276","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ttR25GRj2XmlZu1WlVSijoj570A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"festival","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
