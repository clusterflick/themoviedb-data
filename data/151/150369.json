It's only when the paint comes off that the real danger strikes on a wild Waco weekend filled with thrills, spills and more twists than an eight second bull ride.","popularity":1.0772,"poster_path":"/zI9OkspF9lXsOpqKjo6AM4qyi4v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Americana Images","origin_country":""},{"id":15230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sound Shore","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dodging Bulls Is Dangerous.
