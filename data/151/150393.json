The formal aspect in the movie is a lot of trick shots using a mirror, photographs and negatives.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/5dwmNUo9E3vIF9w27bDhFesUrmr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spółdzielnia Autorow Filmowych","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1937-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of a Good Citizen","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franciszka Themerson","original_name":"Franciszka Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ae19251416c910c8c61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Themerson","original_name":"Stefan Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ae19251416c910c8c65","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Themerson","original_name":"Stefan Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae19251416c910c8c51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Themerson","original_name":"Stefan Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae19251416c910c8c57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211777,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan Kisielewski","original_name":"Stefan Kisielewski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae19251416c910c8c6b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franciszka Themerson","original_name":"Franciszka Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5524086c92514171cb006877","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franciszka Themerson","original_name":"Franciszka Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f65da6a57530e0039a90dd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1857834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/5dwmNUo9E3vIF9w27bDhFesUrmr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
