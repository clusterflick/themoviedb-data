The club's owners--Steve, a handsome ladies' man, and Jeff, his clownish sidekick--hatch a plan to keep the club open. Steve arranges to meet--and woo--Vicki and then invite her and her uncle to the club. When Vicki's snobbish aunt and the manager discover that Vicki now favors popular music over the classics, they arrange to get the club closed. But that doesn't keep Steve and Jeff down. Instead, they decide to put on a Broadway show if they can get a backer. They find their \"angel\" in Vicki's uncle who agrees to finance the show only if Vicki is the leading lady. But again, Vicki's aunt and manager may be the spoiler in everyone's plans.","popularity":1.2716,"poster_path":"/p9FDf0ONu3sQZBcCbCMFTqw8hoN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
