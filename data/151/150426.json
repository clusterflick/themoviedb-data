He lives in St. Lucia with wife Lady Anne Coke (herself an Earl's daughter and lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret) and their sole surviving son, Christopher, disabled by an accident. Glenconner visits Mustique, explores old haunts, and prepares an outdoor lunch for the Princess. He gets on with his wife; he's charming, irritable, waspish, a snob. With Margaret, he's unctuous and outrageously ribald. It's up close and personal with this aging, white-robed, old-moneyed European amongst Black workers and nouveau riche Americans. A portrait emerges of the rich against the backdrop of third-world paradise.","popularity":0.1177,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4095,"logo_path":"/zR0M1hMBNRKyYnRHMidK9WjUsUX.png","name":"First Run Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Bought Mustique","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lord Glenconner","original_name":"Lord Glenconner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"571f74559251416f33003172","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vikram Jayanti","original_name":"Vikram Jayanti","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4b9fbe0a8dcf9c930f42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Bullman","original_name":"Joseph Bullman","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4bd26482c0c836930e84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0264666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
