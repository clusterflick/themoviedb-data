The story is told by the people who made it happen, from the transformation of the Artz farm to the Preservation March, a Civil War wedding and Dr. Pierre’s Medicine Show. You’ll sit around the campfire with your “pards” and then plunge into the foggy mist of The Cornfield with the Iron Brigade and Hood’s Texans—assault the Bloody Lane with the Irish Brigade—and hold off Burnside’s relentless columns with A.P. Hill’s Light Division.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antietam: 135th Anniversary Commemorative Reenactment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
