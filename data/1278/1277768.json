The title in Caló, the language used by Gitanos, translates as ‘we want to speak’, a revolutionary message that illustrates the efforts to reclaim a place in Spanish history for the Roma people and denounce the institutional injustice suffered by the community. It takes as its starting point the Pragmatic decrees signed by the Catholic Monarchs at the end of the fifteenth century, which heralded the long persecution of the Roma people, and continues right up to the twentieth-century Francoist laws.","popularity":0.1925,"poster_path":"/tCrXf9LCKwKYtX8FHlj7Wf1UKXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":226764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mino Films S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camelamos naquerar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"camelamos naquerar (queremos hablar)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Revilla","original_name":"Carlos Revilla","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"662514d02e2b2c0187677e89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ángel Ter","original_name":"Ángel Ter","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/r3NjNilSycv2OiI8ZgWrxu02Vqc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"662514ed221ba60149128f98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2062015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Maya","original_name":"Mario Maya","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/igmtaoWcEzwDQHxv1iHUt5mlYff.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"662516e72dda890187e23e4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4666426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Concha Vargas","original_name":"Concha Vargas","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6625177163e6fb0165fbb8b4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2062015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Maya","original_name":"Mario Maya","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/igmtaoWcEzwDQHxv1iHUt5mlYff.jpg","credit_id":"662516c663e6fb0165fbb86f","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4666378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Alcobendas","original_name":"Miguel Alcobendas","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662512c8cb6db50186af53f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2062015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Maya","original_name":"Mario Maya","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/igmtaoWcEzwDQHxv1iHUt5mlYff.jpg","credit_id":"66251aff62f3350131d75d80","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4666468,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Lafuente","original_name":"José Lafuente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66251bc1e295b401649a0b3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737561,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luis Mamerto López-Tapias","original_name":"Luis Mamerto López-Tapias","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66251b797a97ab017d8de461","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4666378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Alcobendas","original_name":"Miguel Alcobendas","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662519cf07faa2018799cfd0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4666398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Heredia Maya","original_name":"José Heredia Maya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66251ae37a97ab017d8de412","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317725,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roberto Gómez","original_name":"Roberto Gómez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66251aaa2e2b2c018767816c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0165660","wikidata_id":"Q108684473","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZaQTlJUEP8aeE3S62Q8uFqAECU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/tCrXf9LCKwKYtX8FHlj7Wf1UKXl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
