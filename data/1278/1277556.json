Anjelah Johnson-Reyes' never-before-released fifth comedy special, “Technically Not Stalking”, was filmed in April 2022 at the Tempe Improv in Arizona, and it is just now making its full debut. The special draws upon pre-pandemic comedy from Anjelah’s “Technically Not Stalking Tour” and is a personal victory for her as it was the first comedy special she proudly self-produced and self-funded. Join Anjelah in this personal, high-energy, and hilarious one-hour special as she talks about her love of seasonal guacamole, her dog Banzo’s DNA test, visiting haunted places while on the road, a 1990’s ghost named Stacy, and how she stalks her husband Manny…. even when he’s just at home on the couch!","popularity":0.4465,"poster_path":"/ca6HQFtBt1HLEA4UKQdbt8zibwW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anjelah Johnson-Reyes: Technically Not Stalking","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anjelah Johnson-Reyes","original_name":"Anjelah Johnson-Reyes","popularity":0.7307,"profile_path":"/aMTTPuXs9AF2nW3zj7ZnvqooCQz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"662bb03be16e5a011ce77684","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anjelah Johnson-Reyes","original_name":"Anjelah Johnson-Reyes","popularity":0.7307,"profile_path":"/aMTTPuXs9AF2nW3zj7ZnvqooCQz.jpg","credit_id":"66962ccab34b37d6de73ae91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4832335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Ouellette","original_name":"Taylor Ouellette","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66962ce880dbccc377fd9844","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27830120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ca6HQFtBt1HLEA4UKQdbt8zibwW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
