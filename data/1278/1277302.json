Yet he was far more than a simple rebel. Michael Gaismair had extraordinary foresight and he dared to fundamentally question the church and the supremacy of the nobles – which of course did not please the authorities at all.  Betrayal and imprisonment only fueled his passion for the concerns of the peasants and ensured that he was no longer content with reforms.  In his thoughts and actions, he was in no way inferior to Martin Luther and Thomas Müntzer. His plans and actions brought him into contact with the Swiss reformer Ulrich Zwingli and the two kingdoms of France and Venice.  His demands was far ahead of its time and already included points such as the separation of the church from the state, or the reduction of privileges.  But the powerful Habsburgs knew how to prevent this and persecuted the Tyrolean leader until his death.","popularity":0.0936,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":226711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra Internationale Filmproduktionen","origin_country":""},{"id":103135,"logo_path":"/ffj2JNRaYdNTv8iyWau4W4LGiQJ.png","name":"Albolina Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Gaismayr","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexa Brunner","original_name":"Alexa Brunner","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Magdalena Gaismair","credit_id":"6623d75a62f3350131d73a42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2368472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Götsch","original_name":"Günther Götsch","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Stefan Ganner","credit_id":"6623d772258823017d90df92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schorn","original_name":"Peter Schorn","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/7RG2oUryDyNWO5wZtm3SQY1T5QK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michael Gaismair","credit_id":"6623d786cb6db50186adf60b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Moser","original_name":"Wolfgang Moser","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d79e63d937018771e0b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Moser","original_name":"Wolfgang Moser","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d7a7e894a601643a057c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018606,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wilfried Gufler","original_name":"Wilfried Gufler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d7bc7a97ab017d8c92f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Neumair","original_name":"Robert Neumair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d7c42dda890149dfe76e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932392,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Harald Erschbaumer","original_name":"Harald Erschbaumer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d7ddcb5c8e01873f6050","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608732,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milena Holzknecht","original_name":"Milena Holzknecht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d7f02e2b2c01876639c8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647942,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mattia Ottaviani","original_name":"Mattia Ottaviani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d809e295b40164998595","department":"Camera","job":"Steadicam Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guglielmo Trautvetter","original_name":"Guglielmo Trautvetter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623d81acb5c8e01873f6093","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MICHAEL GAISMAYR By Wolfgang Moser I ITALY","key":"6wDwZ5AQ51A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-15T17:42:57.000Z","id":"6623d746e295b4018799e67a"}]}}}
