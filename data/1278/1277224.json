The sound consists of dynamic and evolving patterns of music textures and phrases. Dense masses of granular particles often converge to create progressive patterns of movement, which alternate with recurring looped vocal passages.  The animated imagery was created through a multitude of experimental processes, including video 'rephotography' of direct-on-35mm-film animated sequences (painting and etching imagery direct on 35mm clear and black film stocks), object animation, handmade animated mattes, and 'animated rephotography' of live action sequences. The imagery was composited and edited in digital post production.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/oACasCmnVdOwaNHBcvX9mtDIkP2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All That Remains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66354edffe6c1801292ffa25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oACasCmnVdOwaNHBcvX9mtDIkP2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
