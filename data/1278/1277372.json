Whether small or large, common or particular, the people of Iran have unique hopes, and dreams for a brighter future.  However, through years of domination and oppression, our visions and aspirations have collected dust.  Locked away, no longer considered attainable.  With the current uprising, many people have found the key to their dreams once again.  This film explores what some of these dreams are from multiple perspectives and backgrounds.  Iranians are a diverse group of people, ranging from many cultures, religions, and identities.  This film aims to capture some of these nuances by including dreams from Kurdish Iranians, Bahai’s, Christians, queer folks, and more.  Everyone has a dream for freedom.  What does that dream look like to you?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iran, In My Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasaman Asgari","original_name":"Yasaman Asgari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623f8e9cb6db50149ad1981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
