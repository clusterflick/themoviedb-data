But the Wheelers didn't know that. They needed to catch the bus. On the way, their jokes are ignored, a jogger tries to sit on them and they are almost hit by a car. The bus door is repeatedly slammed in their faces, and it catches the arm of Mrs. Wheeler. Stuck, the bus drags her down the street. Convinced they must be dead, they give up and wait for God to take them. But in God's stead, an eccentric old woman sets them straight and guides them to empowerment.","popularity":0.3788,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":226668,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wackler Wellness","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aging in America is not for the weak.","title":"Catching the Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Doucette","original_name":"Jeff Doucette","popularity":0.3599,"profile_path":"/jx4AT6IIYVIUTEAUwibPZHoPyyx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Wheeler","credit_id":"6622e209e4b576017dbd9269","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Wackler","original_name":"Rebecca Wackler","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Wheeler","credit_id":"6622e22a0231f20163123eec","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Wackler","original_name":"Rebecca Wackler","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e266bb10570189d38a12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403228,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laurence Juber","original_name":"Laurence Juber","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e2be0d11f20164024acf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Wackler","original_name":"Rebecca Wackler","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e29fe640d60163c3aeb7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4663558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wackler Wellness","original_name":"Wackler Wellness","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e2aae4b576017dbd929f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Levi Lee","original_name":"Eddie Levi Lee","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e2590231f200c11103a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1972214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cynthia Stillwell","original_name":"Cynthia Stillwell","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kTTH122qfAEe2Jx1ouoe4QQZ4yp.jpg","credit_id":"6622e2958a88b20185cbd918","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589129,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Branney","original_name":"Sean Branney","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e26e0443c90164766d0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierce Cook","original_name":"Pierce Cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622e2d10231f20163123f25","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4619260,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"B.
