The student doesn’t confess what he did and who else involved in the movement and the officer keeps on torturing him. By the way, the police officer spoke out how he’s been working as an informal worker at a police office, which he must work over time without any special bonus and any insurance from work. He’s consoled by the one who he’d arrested.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/q6oq9p7FSESXs2lUFkw3KMxuo2b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Someone Grateful","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jang Jin","original_name":"장진","popularity":0.3121,"profile_path":"/5pY3RX9p2tV1XXyLtkAkDRPnGBG.jpg","credit_id":"66243b8ccb6db50186ae2e37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q6oq9p7FSESXs2lUFkw3KMxuo2b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
