Sites stretching from prehistoric times to the 10th century are evidence of the archipelago's cosmopolitanism since the early century AD based on the Citarum River. The discovery and interpretation of it were also guided by Indonesian archaeologists, long after the colonial antiquities department had led archaeological missions in the past. This film is a poem for ancient terracotta, soil, archaeologists and the citizens of Batujaya today.","popularity":0.202,"poster_path":"/ifGtS6whAQKOedGpHXXDfTyVw3V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Milisifilem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terakota Batujaya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4664226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bambang Budi Utomo","original_name":"Bambang Budi Utomo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iY0WyJHEYcAPXJN3GBL2x2qn0zf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Archeologist","credit_id":"6623588a221ba60163126205","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339617,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luthfan Nur Rochman","original_name":"Luthfan Nur Rochman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lRtxf5uXkc70Z1C9noNMuYgIP7Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luthfan","credit_id":"6623589687e63e0188732e94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4613590,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dini Adanurani","original_name":"Dini Adanurani","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/xSjjLR5kuL38Vhkifo8zLNc4c5E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dini","credit_id":"662358a263d937016471417c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunarto","original_name":"Sunarto","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Penjaga Candi","credit_id":"662358bfaf9590017d674fab","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339617,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luthfan Nur Rochman","original_name":"Luthfan Nur Rochman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lRtxf5uXkc70Z1C9noNMuYgIP7Z.jpg","credit_id":"662358fe07faa20187987bbd","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339617,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luthfan Nur Rochman","original_name":"Luthfan Nur Rochman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lRtxf5uXkc70Z1C9noNMuYgIP7Z.jpg","credit_id":"66235907221ba6017c12bbaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hafiz Rancajale","original_name":"Hafiz Rancajale","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/hcw4F7xiOLXpf7fRgeCsQpyJ8kX.jpg","credit_id":"66235911b2681f01a9727d8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4613590,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dini Adanurani","original_name":"Dini Adanurani","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/xSjjLR5kuL38Vhkifo8zLNc4c5E.jpg","credit_id":"662358f2af9590016466fd87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4664228,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eko Yulianto","original_name":"Eko Yulianto","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vE6tHi5scGSo3MwWntCTB49lhRf.jpg","credit_id":"6623596d221ba6017c12bc26","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4664229,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alifah Melisa","original_name":"Alifah Melisa","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1YyXx7SUF989gl4CCEo4K78qPss.jpg","credit_id":"66235a1f197de4017d2a1d3d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifGtS6whAQKOedGpHXXDfTyVw3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":904}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":300076,"name":"indonesian history"},{"id":331554,"name":"batujaya"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
