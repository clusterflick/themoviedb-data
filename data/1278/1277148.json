Norma passed away before we could pick up the project again, so this is all that we've got.  This was edited and uploaded in 2019 to celebrate Norma's Supernova exhibiition in Claremont, CA.  For those who have commented about the music in the first couple of minutes, that is Norma's track \"Air Hymn\" from her album with John Zeretzke.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Stranger Am I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
