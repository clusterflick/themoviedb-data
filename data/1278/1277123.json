It is marked by countless exciting, sometimes dramatic, sometimes amusing and bizarre episodes. Among them are repeated public socio-political disputes, such as the controversy surrounding the establishment of the Zurich Giacometti Foundation in the 1960s or, more recently, the debate about the Emil G. Bührle Collection. Legendary exhibitions have contributed to the international reputation of the museum, including the world's first museum exhibition of Picasso in 1932.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":"/sbSztAXvsr8DDsjOE0CSu2la8gg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Durchs Höllentor ins Paradies - Die Geschichte des Kunsthaus Zürich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1986902,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Walser","original_name":"Anne Walser","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662315522e2b2c0163655933","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Reichenbach","original_name":"Peter Reichenbach","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/2J6w67fqgq2CXDOmr5JplEe0uLM.jpg","credit_id":"662314ffb9a0bd017ad41db2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Reichenbach","original_name":"Peter Reichenbach","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/2J6w67fqgq2CXDOmr5JplEe0uLM.jpg","credit_id":"6623150862f335017dd7606f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4663878,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sibylle Cazajus","original_name":"Sibylle Cazajus","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662315102e2b2c01876570d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29580691","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sbSztAXvsr8DDsjOE0CSu2la8gg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
