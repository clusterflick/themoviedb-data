Working like a machine, she ultimately suffers from the rare digital disease \"01,\" which leaves a strange mark on one half of her face. Ena goes back to her hometown. That is when \"Babalon\" appears before her which only Ena can see. Frightened by \"Babalon\" that speaks of \"destruction,\" a strange boy named Robert shows up. Robert invites Ena to enter the mysterious antique shop \"Anatomic Circus.\" That is where Ena learns about the magic lantern show \"Fantasmagorie\" that swept the late 18th century Paris. It involved a real Ghost Show with actual ghosts that also lead to the police getting involved. Ena becomes a captive of both \"Fantasmagorie\" and the founder Robertson. That is when a change occurs around Ena. She is lured by a song to leave the shop. That is when strange men pursue her, and she wonders into a maze dominated by \"Babalon.\"","popularity":0.4251,"poster_path":"/D9a6QR3OvfcTrunUdbIyo38Mkv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fantasmagorie~The Ghost Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ファンタスマゴリー　ザ・ゴーストショー","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ファンタスマゴリー〜 ザ・ゴーストショー","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ファンタスマゴリー 〜 ザ・ゴーストショー","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Fantasmagorie - The Ghost Show","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2101001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Ogawa","original_name":"小川紗良","popularity":0.2524,"profile_path":"/ikwnXqbgdWEwyM2AwBP0Xc7yDHD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ena","credit_id":"6623eea5af9590014a66dc13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masatoshi Nagase","original_name":"永瀬正敏","popularity":0.6942,"profile_path":"/i4FjAoP2xPtG82lEGnIkL7mFc6g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The coffee shop owner","credit_id":"6623ec1c2588230164907528","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hyde","original_name":"Hyde","popularity":0.2997,"profile_path":"/bw3iKVDlQOvdCswGLkpKtfHUPRv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"6623ec07258823017d90e7cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manon Aubron","original_name":"Manon Aubron","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ena Young","credit_id":"6623ee68e295b40164998b9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marius Aubron","original_name":"Marius Aubron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Robert Young","credit_id":"6623ee7ab2681f01a972d566","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Nikai","original_name":"Ken Nikai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623ee1fe295b40164998b7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1415179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Nikai","original_name":"二階健","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623ee427a97ab017d8c9ed1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1415179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Nikai","original_name":"二階健","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623ee2e7a97ab017d8c9ec0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2904124,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mitsuo Nishio","original_name":"西尾光男","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677787fc321a3a166a7493b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26625372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"Fantasmagorie01"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEYmGF5XzXiGRQXLoF2IA51e1Cl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wODPZIgRhAe87Jr00S3W2O6xrpf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5ORPlZ9pKN87GwaN6sDRhFlKii.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ej55EvcApwmch221UapmEjISeRL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/JpkBYq9d4qEidP79SG3xxfyfwJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/D9a6QR3OvfcTrunUdbIyo38Mkv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"映画「ファンタスマゴリー 〜 ザ・ゴーストショー」予告編","key":"8t219LF0agk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-23T06:01:05.000Z","id":"6782948f601acfe7bd4ef551"}]}}}
