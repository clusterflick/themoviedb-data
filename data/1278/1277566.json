Twenty thousand living historians from across the United States and around the world converged on the Nancy Bushey Farm near Gettysburg, to commemorate the bravery, honor and sacrifice of our ancestors.  With the introduction by Patrick Falci (Historical Advisor to Director Ron Maxwell, and Author Jeff Shaara), this video documents the planning, production and execution of the reenactment. Included are the key phases of the Battle of Gettysburg—the armies “First Contact” on July 1, 1863; the struggle in the Rose Woods; through “The Wheatfield”, into the “Valley of Death”, up “Little Round Top” and “Culp’s Hill” during the second day, and an epic, full-scale recreation of “Picket’s Charge”. The action is described by the reenactment commanders and coordinators, featuring their insight into the battle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Start to Finish","title":"Gettysburg: 135th Anniversary Commemorative Reenactment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
