This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.1141,"poster_path":"/dJVI8Yq1jXr6dTkmCJ1Zl9qw6VI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Fruit","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rachel Portman","original_name":"Rachel Portman","popularity":0.2666,"profile_path":"/Am3W0n5fPR7hepTR0c1X7RC1zZO.jpg","credit_id":"65043ef1d7dcd200acb24eb1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2135516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Cam Van Nguyen","original_name":"Diana Cam Van Nguyen","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/ML2RH4t6qb3sOveeESOfKKrW7C.jpg","credit_id":"65043ee46a2227011a7ca195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJVI8Yq1jXr6dTkmCJ1Zl9qw6VI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rachel Portman (UK) x Diana Cam Van Nguyen (Czech Republic, Vietnam) - Dancing Fruit","key":"_jKBYgPW8-w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-15T07:15:01.000Z","id":"6523b2e774507d00c57d2ce0"}]}}}
