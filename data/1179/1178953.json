What are they waiting for? And who is looking at who? Who is threatening who? This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9zgaYfSyZjc1YrTYqfnyJGoIh0k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208707,"logo_path":"/rg9KwSNUSystqFJbLIJhEvePtTy.png","name":"Film Fest Ghent","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chamariz","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk Brossé","original_name":"Dirk Brossé","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/voAjz2rDB5ZeUa0YEjVMn5qcL6U.jpg","credit_id":"650442f063aad200e12d2874","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meltse Van Coillie","original_name":"Meltse Van Coillie","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65044301e0ca7f012eba7210","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":797,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9zgaYfSyZjc1YrTYqfnyJGoIh0k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
