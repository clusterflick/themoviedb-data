A fight against his own people, which eventually took his leg and his freedom. While working on a prosthesis with filmmaker Pitou Schütz, Jamal explains how losing a leg brought him to the Netherlands. This results in a story, partly visualised through animation, about his flight from brute violence and his search for a new future.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46421,"logo_path":"/rajjM3rDu86FKIGDLQUGy1H41Ym.png","name":"Revolver Amsterdam","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simpele dromen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pitou Schütz","original_name":"Pitou Schütz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650426ebe0ca7f012eba66e4","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oscar Schütz","original_name":"Oscar Schütz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650426f8ffc9de0eded5c4f3","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pitou Schütz","original_name":"Pitou Schütz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650426d6e0ca7f012eba66c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Germen Boelens","original_name":"Germen Boelens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650426e163aad2013800a2d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qZOh3g6d4Sqca6p6tKeYFlDv6OC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"Nederlands Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
