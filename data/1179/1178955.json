This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.2802,"poster_path":"/95hZEJPGybFv0DcFfTImUhyy7jS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanctuary","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juanita Onzaga","original_name":"Juanita Onzaga","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504437edb4ed61033a3d6b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9152,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Doyle","original_name":"Patrick Doyle","popularity":0.2346,"profile_path":"/w7ZWMi75p0a6ElIbZw9mfkmjGPs.jpg","credit_id":"6504438f63aad200c44f067d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":805,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95hZEJPGybFv0DcFfTImUhyy7jS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
