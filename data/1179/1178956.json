The elder brother leads his sibling to a house—empty apart from a poster of Muhammad Ali. They set up a small area to exercise and the young boy is pushed to his limits, as he is perpetually asked to hit boxing gloves harder and harder. This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.2156,"poster_path":"/riClJVmNRNmgkMLa0jIoMCpixIu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drift","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Howard Shore","original_name":"Howard Shore","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":"/nJ606tXnL8vDVHi7qavrV292ljt.jpg","credit_id":"65044485ffc9de0ee178a40b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Nti","original_name":"Anthony Nti","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/O3SSqq99XMGxLjYwbnmLHoP4YX.jpg","credit_id":"65044479d7dcd20139ccd9ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759623,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chingiz Karibekov","original_name":"Chingiz Karibekov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65044462d7dcd200acb25121","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1461,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/riClJVmNRNmgkMLa0jIoMCpixIu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":974}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
