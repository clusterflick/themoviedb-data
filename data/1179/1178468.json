A nation-wide movement, known simply as The Resistance, rises in opposition. Resistencia: The Fight for the Aguan Valley centers on the most daring wing of the movement, the farmers of the Aguan. Not satisfied with just marching and blocking highways, 2000 landless families take possession of the palm oil plantations of Miguel Facusse, the country's largest landowner and a key player in the coup. The camera follows three farmers over four years as they build their new communities on occupied land, in the face of the regime's violent response, while waiting for the elections The Resistance hopes will restore the national democratic project.","popularity":0.3014,"poster_path":"/nwA3T5s78jA6eP1Jz5HzNHSfMqU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resistencia: The Fight for the Aguan Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse Freeston","original_name":"Jesse Freeston","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65033919ffc9de0ee3c71f7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487747,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Abraham Lifshitz","original_name":"Abraham Lifshitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65033a61e0ca7f00cbeba87d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271703,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Billy Buntin","original_name":"Billy Buntin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65033a78d7dcd20139cc42c6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Portillo","original_name":"René Portillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65033a88ffc9de0ee20a6d48","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4219614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nwA3T5s78jA6eP1Jz5HzNHSfMqU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7105,"name":"honduras"},{"id":227148,"name":"anarchism"},{"id":277177,"name":"decolonization"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Resistencia: The Fight for the Aguan Valley (5 min Crowdfunding Taster - 2012)","key":"8C1sTrY_JdQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-02-23T03:23:53.000Z","id":"65033a3aea37e0013a4e957d"}]}}}
