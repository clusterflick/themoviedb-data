This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.1123,"poster_path":"/kXjKU9FgBhIOagoZNN41b5u0vrJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208707,"logo_path":"/rg9KwSNUSystqFJbLIJhEvePtTy.png","name":"Film Fest Ghent","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tempo","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Pedro Rodrigues","original_name":"João Pedro Rodrigues","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/brhgU34tTfmojGWtpZnOe8wm9mv.jpg","credit_id":"65043b02ffc9de0ee3c799a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Yared","original_name":"Gabriel Yared","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/kqJzXNKsL5LJU1FZBjobHVSnnjp.jpg","credit_id":"65043b11db4ed61032a92894","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno Carvalho","original_name":"Nuno Carvalho","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65046dcfc390c500e1226045","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166278,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mariana Gaivão","original_name":"Mariana Gaivão","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/ljnegppV3hY3Sohu06p95b8OmKE.jpg","credit_id":"65046db9e0ca7f012eba8023","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kXjKU9FgBhIOagoZNN41b5u0vrJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2PN0AyoAaPQ82d5M3rnOBWYXgYG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
