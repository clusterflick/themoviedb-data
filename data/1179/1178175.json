He paddles from Geneva via the Rhône and the Loire once across France. In Saint-Nazaire he reaches the Atlantic Ocean and paddles south along the coast. When conditions become too difficult and dangerous in autumn, he continues his journey across the Bay of Biscay on an old sailing ship. The whole thing without any significant experience in sea kayaking or sailing, but with sometimes unexpected obstacles such as the dams on the Rhône and the notorious storms on the Bay of Biscay. Always with him: the camera to capture all impressions and experiences directly.","popularity":0.0676,"poster_path":"/yLyRJVeYGk3skEdxHafrCa5q8qV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Course Southwest - The Trip of a Lifetime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Kurs Südwest - Das Abenteuer meines Lebens","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lukas Borchers","original_name":"Lukas Borchers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65116302344a8e096d9f1973","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lukas Borchers","original_name":"Lukas Borchers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511630c344a8e096d9f1979","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21261338","wikidata_id":"Q120885635","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yLyRJVeYGk3skEdxHafrCa5q8qV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
