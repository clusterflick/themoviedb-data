Hidden truths that still remain silent despite the intervening century. Descendants of Turkish and British soldiers who crossed paths in Mesopotamia during the First World War think upon the unknown stories of their grandfathers and how it has affected their lives. The film progresses with testimonies from two different nations' prisoners of war, who have been left outside of the historical framework, and showcases the shared painful effects of war's cruelty upon individuals, and the bond that distinguishes the reality of history from memory and forgiveness. The film focuses on the tragic stories of W. C. Spackman, an English military doctor working in the Indian Army, and Colonel Suphi Bey, a Turkish officer, whose destinies intersect in Mesopotamia.","popularity":0.084,"poster_path":"/huM0jnfSzLQk9gnIVyzojku7cTP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2024-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Water of Babylon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Berfi Dicle Öğüt","original_name":"Berfi Dicle Öğüt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e922efea7a00c397f426","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Berfi Dicle Öğüt","original_name":"Berfi Dicle Öğüt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e9b4db4ed61032a8883d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271164,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Doğan Şahin","original_name":"Doğan Şahin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e958ffc9de0ee17805ec","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Berfi Dicle Öğüt","original_name":"Berfi Dicle Öğüt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e919db4ed61036400b75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2711043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fırat Terzioğlu","original_name":"Fırat Terzioğlu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e9a7db4ed61036400bbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3268172,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Semih Yildiz","original_name":"Semih Yıldız","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e94c1bf26600ffb6bbc8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emrullah Erbay","original_name":"Emrullah Erbay","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502e99f1bf26600ffb6bbe9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/huM0jnfSzLQk9gnIVyzojku7cTP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"30.
