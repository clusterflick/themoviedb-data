The engraved Cyrillic letters tell of a woman, Chrysoula Rodaki, who died in 1887. And so the search for her descendants begins: It leads director Kerem Soyyilmaz to local archives, where his own family's role in history is laid bare; to abandoned ghost towns and through the memories of older villagers - all while Soyyilmaz meets massive support for his quest from Greeks on the other side of the border. The stone becomes a portal to the past - and for a while, the trauma becomes redeemed when the previous owners of the village house return.","popularity":0.3469,"poster_path":"/m1jZWVNNHw6MVR88kLMSR2dF66O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching For Rodakis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Searching for Rodakis","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Searching for Rodakis","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Searching for Rodakis","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Searching for Rodakis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271167,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andreas Ascanius Lundmark Jakobsen","original_name":"Andreas Ascanius Lundmark Jakobsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502ead81bf266013a762ae3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636384,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Burak Dal","original_name":"Burak Dal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502eae3d7dcd200ffecefa9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerem Soyyılmaz","original_name":"Kerem Soyyılmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502eab81bf266013a762acf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerem Soyyılmaz","original_name":"Kerem Soyyılmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502eaa7e0ca7f012eb9d3ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4271166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerem Soyyılmaz","original_name":"Kerem Soyyılmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502eab0ffc9de0ee00e7985","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6HgU9bQW4etzMJZm4BhaPpLX5LY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27Yn142gdmT3iPWiIUVy2iC0QIw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AsNMcwkVXfJnjisPtPQH4ke74pV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEMk93TVbojCgEWx5AbLOqFlUUm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4O2gdynWzURKABzEyUx3VF4JDbO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Ug6WKjn5rjUvwEDjMkT2Fo7vcD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s7pXmQilPWpAri9i4x4VvC5W6kg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/shqa7t9vccBbj1shINW9u1VTG3n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3OdVaQUtcNmWC2gGcnH7EIIK631.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6KN0T7B8PLu1aQnjW4A24Rd5WIS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":854,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ukPFihN9EIqV9CbyVpJc37b4UcE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1518}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m1jZWVNNHw6MVR88kLMSR2dF66O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/sB5ToKN2lYtnqd83ywvPDErAj09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":992},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sWWjoJIAiwcOWEYwSDN5X1Eifa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3393,"name":"tombstone"},{"id":11112,"name":"search"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"30.
