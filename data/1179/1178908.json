Yaron plays junior league soccer for the Haifa Maccabees. They're having a great season, in part because Yaron lifts the team's spirits by enthusiastically broadcasting their games from a microphone at the bench. When a player is injured and Yaron plays, it's a disaster. But the one person who can't find out is his dad, Danny, whose football exploits as a youth are his favourite memory. Now a stevedore, Danny works when the games are played and thinks Yaron is a star. The Maccabees are set to play a Jerusalem team for the league championship on Saturday - Danny wants the day off and Yaron goes to the coach and begs to play. Can he be a hero to his dad?","popularity":0.1155,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Personal Goals","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ran Carmeli","original_name":"Ran Carmeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65042b2cdb4ed61032a92230","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":320826,"name":"eat carpet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
