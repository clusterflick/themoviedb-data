This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography,  fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/t9fSzIsZd4pbkWkJ3uHFXNejwrv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208707,"logo_path":"/rg9KwSNUSystqFJbLIJhEvePtTy.png","name":"Film Fest Ghent","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":4549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polyphonic Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2023-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passing Time","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Davies","original_name":"Terence Davies","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/6Nb0JwfAr4LJQQH3G3s8yfGqDKn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65047fbc798e0600ebd331f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Davies","original_name":"Terence Davies","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/6Nb0JwfAr4LJQQH3G3s8yfGqDKn.jpg","credit_id":"650436eb63aad2011b232ec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":569203,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florencia Di Concilio","original_name":"Florencia Di Concilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65043826ffc9de0ee3c7987b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Dowling","original_name":"James Dowling","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65046801d7dcd2011c625f30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Davies","original_name":"Terence Davies","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/6Nb0JwfAr4LJQQH3G3s8yfGqDKn.jpg","credit_id":"6509fa849661fc01e50deb69","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Dowling","original_name":"James Dowling","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6520b80bc50ad200ad843e5d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4309056,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gregory Browning","original_name":"Gregory Browning","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6520b880c1ffbd00ac55a877","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30629641","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":821,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/foQ36s5icBcUtlbNVpPVvkcPqgl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1460}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9fSzIsZd4pbkWkJ3uHFXNejwrv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":493,"name":"poem"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Festival Ghent","release_date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Florencia Di Concilio (Uruguay) x Terence Davies (UK) - Passing Time","key":"lS-boGJ8hd0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-15T07:15:02.000Z","id":"655ba42b10923000feaddfb0"}]}}}
