One of the most fascinating countries in Europe, but above all, one of the most mysterious. An island at the mercy of the sea winds, washed by the Atlantic and the waters of the Celtic and Irish seas. The island's beauty can be found in its rugged coastline, dramatic cliffs, streams, lakes and peat bogs. But above all, Ireland is a country full of spectacular stories. Its Celtic myths and legends have shaped its culture and our imagination. An air of mystery still hovers over the country of over 70,000 square kilometres. This is reflected in traditions, beliefs, folk music. This is also the legacy of thousands of years of history in an extraordinary land where, according to legend, giants and fairies still hide in the rocks and caves.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ireland - Celtic Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Irlande, la magie celte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Irsko, keltská magie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Ireland - Celtic Magic","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginie Schwartz","original_name":"Virginie Schwartz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504414d6a2227011a7ca2bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
