The elders whispered that he had fled Morocco for another woman, never to return. Farid grew up in the shadow of this repressed absence, got married, and embarked on a promising career. Then, a letter from Montreal arrived. The truth came crashing down, cruelly, after decades of lies: it was at the request of Farid's mother that his father had left them, and it wasn't for another woman, but because he himself aspired to be one... So Farid set out to turn back time and meet the long-awaited mother he never met.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139912,"logo_path":"/xzMndHeSKROjIrep9Rl4jDH14f8.png","name":"Objectif 9","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"L'héritier des secrets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2474886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Nadif","original_name":"Mohamed Nadif","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650369066a222700e0f3a22a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
