This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.4181,"poster_path":"/AjUIz5ynrfx9FN2CzXw46OydZT1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95660,"logo_path":"/jJnIK5HHV7jhTin8HtMht7fcf1Y.png","name":"Center Stage Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moro","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurice Guillen","original_name":"Laurice Guillen","popularity":0.2953,"profile_path":"/x1oPreyFQQRihEBQMu3VDmjeByP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66a73270062e2370d1e0860e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piolo Pascual","original_name":"Piolo Pascual","popularity":0.7836,"profile_path":"/4kpaukf9kYfPhHfHEW5ye3Ni8W5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66a73276ab34a9e371abab08","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baron Geisler","original_name":"Baron Geisler","popularity":0.4006,"profile_path":"/aRb59G35voCTy3SYOZfj8D5oBDQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66a7327df649316aacd39a54","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher de Leon","original_name":"Christopher de Leon","popularity":2.9098,"profile_path":"/jpQM7oL3A4Vxukffwd5rULaZEk3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66a73290169ca9722402b709","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brillante Ma Mendoza","original_name":"Brillante Ma Mendoza","popularity":0.4072,"profile_path":"/qJbuPkCD5J4KBKUxfzhpgv9uSEd.jpg","credit_id":"65043c8063aad200c44f038d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1069812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nainita Desai","original_name":"Nainita Desai","popularity":0.1968,"profile_path":"/qXQfrocquCuHgOS1AX4oXby6kGI.jpg","credit_id":"65043c91ffc9de0ee3c79a2a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355387,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Honeylyn Joy Alipio","original_name":"Honeylyn Joy Alipio","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a732f6d1b518259de084bd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AjUIz5ynrfx9FN2CzXw46OydZT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
