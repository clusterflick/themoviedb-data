First, Inger is rejected by the love of her youth, Hans, who chooses a rich man’s daughter instead. Because of this, she gets thrown out into the street by her own mother but finds refuge with an acrobat in a travelling circus. When the circus performer dies in an accident, Inger gives birth to a fatherless child who doesn’t survive the night, for which she is even accused of infanticide. Guilt overwhelms Hans as he hears about Inger’s tragedies. Can Hans’ repentance save the lost Inger?
