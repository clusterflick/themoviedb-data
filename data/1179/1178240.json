Join lanky urban wizard Pete Heat as he uses comedy and mind-blowing tricks to explore that most divisive of subjects: magic itself. Is it an incredible, visceral experience that loosens your grasp on reality, or a dated, clich√©-riddled embarrassment? Is it both? Are all magicians terrible people? Was that your card? Has Pete wasted his life? Hate magic? You'll love this show. Love magic? You'll really love this show.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/iNTX3EZVke08lPqzBGxLq1SulTJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100057,"logo_path":null,"name":"NextUp","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pete Heat: Blimey","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1578,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iNTX3EZVke08lPqzBGxLq1SulTJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1052},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/apO8r3tIEWjRxyPkTw5Ryap5CVe.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
