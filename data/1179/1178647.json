This set finishes out Popeye's second decade of screen stardom with cartoons originally released to movie theaters in 1948 and 1949. Providing more globe-trotting and time-traveling adventures, the cartoons have been restored to look their lavish best utilizing the techniques of three classic color systems. The Polacolor process was a short-lived 3-strip technique designed to be an alternative to Technicolor . The studio gave it a try on a group of cartoons produced during this period, and the results are particularly striking -- with fresh restorations that now show their proper, vibrant hues.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rSAINUzrdqZEe0tNXKxg2R2Bynh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Popeye The Sailor The 1940s Volume 3","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rSAINUzrdqZEe0tNXKxg2R2Bynh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1056}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
