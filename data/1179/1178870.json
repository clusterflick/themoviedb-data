Those brave enough to share their stories from that mysterious night in Roswell 1947 faced humiliation and intimidation. 75 years later, as all those who had first hand knowledge of the event have now passed, the truth may never be accepted. We take a look back at the first hand accounts of those who saw, held and were instrumental in disclosing what the government could not, the crash of an alien spaceship. Diluted over the years, this documentary re-examines and focuses on the personal experiences, from witnessing a close encounter to traumatic military threats, which the ordeal had on unwitting bystanders within the Roswell community.","popularity":0.4517,"poster_path":"/aHXcHWx4YtU2ftsMsiGPg03JHdk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Roswell Coverup: 75 Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1719196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanton Friedman","original_name":"Stanton Friedman","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/cdvBlRav8Cz1HNd1IxAhDwUgNTS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6504209dffc9de0ee17895cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Haut","original_name":"Walter Haut","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650420b1d7dcd200acb24004","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Marcel Jr","original_name":"Jesse Marcel Jr","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":"/2YL7VTr9KGBoikeAWN3mxd47lhB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650420c4db4ed610430ab957","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Marcel","original_name":"Jesse Marcel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650420dee0ca7f00ae40def3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piers Garland","original_name":"Piers Garland","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504207c6a222700fd222501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piers Garland","original_name":"Piers Garland","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504208663aad200c44ef5de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20881358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8GGhRHdft5g7S1lS7E7wVhzlfeJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pypM6nmgMkThmS8VoX3bBiOXaXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aHXcHWx4YtU2ftsMsiGPg03JHdk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9738,"name":"ufo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
