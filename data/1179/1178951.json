This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/3RlYDjf8gLkLX081C7ed9S2gFu5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greetings from Crîngași","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radu Jude","original_name":"Radu Jude","popularity":0.3802,"profile_path":"/rOYPp2WUIvWB2HXNIICT44jB7CY.jpg","credit_id":"6504428adb4ed61038578079","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shigeru Umebayashi","original_name":"梅林茂","popularity":0.3278,"profile_path":"/7wzKcmgowMp0GcucFg6yJ6q6oMb.jpg","credit_id":"65044297ea37e000c6393efd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931382,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marius Panduru","original_name":"Marius Panduru","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504926ac92c5d013806a70c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3RlYDjf8gLkLX081C7ed9S2gFu5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gFJkcq9YlOu9pQhqDEwJ7hFBLA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":534},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sNjdYRvg6SHZP4Zaale4eVCxC9N.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
