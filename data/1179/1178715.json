In 1925, the Australian Museum commissioned three statues of ‘full blood ’Aboriginal people: a child, a man and a woman, exhibited as nameless objects to be studied as examples of a ‘dying race.’ The woman was Nellie Walker, Irene Walker’s great grandmother and director Daniel King’s great, great grandmother. Now Irene is on a journey to retrace Nellie’s life and to reconnect the other families to their ancestors’ statues and re-display them, this time with their names, identities and dignity. This is far more than a symbolic quest, but an opportunity to change how we remember and represent, and to give the nameless names.","popularity":0.0977,"poster_path":"/7W5VbaGxoFsHIiyEsuS1fyuKsbc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201735,"logo_path":"/vODaApQ0egx76pn4j4FvKYDChKC.png","name":"National Indigenous Television","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":237373,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Person Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Name is Nanny Nellie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4906928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Ridgeway","original_name":"Irene Ridgeway","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66cd8bffd767d685664df7cf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4272574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel King","original_name":"Daniel King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6503b7c96a222700aba9faaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29328638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7W5VbaGxoFsHIiyEsuS1fyuKsbc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193455,"name":"indigenous australians"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Adelaide Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Her Name is Nanny Nellie | Trailer | SBS, NITV & SBS On Demand","key":"24nyB1ctMhY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-12-12T05:40:11.000Z","id":"66cd8d13da960b085a4ff23f"}]}}}
