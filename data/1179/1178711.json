A mix of home VHS-8 footage from childhood, present-day interviews with family and re-enacted scenes, direct us through the jumble of realisations the siblings have whilst connecting their childhood and teenage experience to their feelings towards their Chinese heritage, now. What's interesting is how different that is for brother and sister, Jamie and Christina, and how that reflects on the whole family.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/93KWrQkj703LSJLciWHJrhsL8fE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wintermelon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4272549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Poon","original_name":"Christina Poon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6503b2971bf266013a767c43","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4272549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Poon","original_name":"Christina Poon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6503b28dd7dcd200e2fe9322","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1157,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93KWrQkj703LSJLciWHJrhsL8fE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":770}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
