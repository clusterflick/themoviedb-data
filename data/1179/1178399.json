The movie makes real the elements of the meme's cerebral universe, giving Sir Isengord a classroom, the black box that holds his mind, and a present-day team of fake scientists investigating his ideas and life. The professor himself speaks as a hologram created by an old-school transparency projector.","popularity":0.2668,"poster_path":"/rh24rgZtNGSY9Wx1QoPghb8OiS1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":300,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If He Saw That, He Would Laugh","title":"Sir Isengord and the Theory of the Magnificent Spinning Quanto Quasi Table","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1617367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Flowers","original_name":"Amanda Flowers","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/rrgrviMzL15wciLPs8w93O0pREQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Little Matthew","credit_id":"650324036a222700aba9c18a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Estevez","original_name":"Joe Estevez","popularity":0.469,"profile_path":"/5Ptl8apcuessOd2SpSYdt1lLcZl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sir Isengord","credit_id":"6503241bffc9de0ee20a659b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Weeden","original_name":"Bill Weeden","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/hYqQ4Gm3ULZghuxiViU3SQOFmyV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alonzo Cream-Tina","credit_id":"6503243dffc9de0eded55078","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1701465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Zaret","original_name":"Tony Zaret","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"George Lucas","credit_id":"650324771bf26600ac75fa7c","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27692774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rh24rgZtNGSY9Wx1QoPghb8OiS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
