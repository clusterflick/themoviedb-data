This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.1392,"poster_path":"/928ctHhsnofFnMVO8voo0RI2Vh0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cigarette","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Tan","original_name":"Jack Tan","popularity":0.1406,"profile_path":"/hu5qFTamb8yQcPLb52UxWMlTOlD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"650aec836c19ea00ca46c5d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2775268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kendra Sow","original_name":"Kendra Sow","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"651e22215b124000ad680b38","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Chen","original_name":"Anthony Chen","popularity":0.3186,"profile_path":"/78xy7fJVDvgs411qratoZur34cQ.jpg","credit_id":"65044174ea37e000c6393e9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558016,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abel Korzeniowski","original_name":"Abel Korzeniowski","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/as9IqiOseNFrnbwg8644WcflNht.jpg","credit_id":"6504417fea37e0011d091c36","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306001,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kahgiap","original_name":"Kahgiap","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651e224b8c22c0012054ef88","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2237142,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Soo Mun Thye","original_name":"Soo Mun Thye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sOn9RmW4Gj3W1ySvw6ISvAS962S.jpg","credit_id":"651e2269a097dc013a57f1ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/928ctHhsnofFnMVO8voo0RI2Vh0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":504},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tE6URrfOW3aFNlMlcWG0vyEPxsl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
