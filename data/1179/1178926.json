This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.1421,"poster_path":"/2XfyEga0ArHfN7XhaK9eRGY4C9L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208707,"logo_path":"/rg9KwSNUSystqFJbLIJhEvePtTy.png","name":"Film Fest Ghent","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Swell","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Jahn","original_name":"Gustavo Jahn","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/8qzzuO2jBhKevH1mdCcHdsZMuqA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Walker","credit_id":"650469f0d7dcd200acb26142","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Wittmann","original_name":"Helena Wittmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wtNDlRjizeyZutR6HCmIPuPJrji.jpg","credit_id":"650439e5ea37e000c6393c0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083316,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnaud Rebotini","original_name":"Arnaud Rebotini","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/a0ZvNJYJrf7hkPgZKWPJSE6z5o3.jpg","credit_id":"650439f1ffc9de0ee178a00d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1982427,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nika Breithaupt","original_name":"Nika Breithaupt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65046a38d7dcd200c538c45c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk Brossé","original_name":"Dirk Brossé","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/voAjz2rDB5ZeUa0YEjVMn5qcL6U.jpg","credit_id":"65046a1b63aad2013800bdef","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2XfyEga0ArHfN7XhaK9eRGY4C9L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Fest Ghent Website","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
