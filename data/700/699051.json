Wolfson is not content to play by the rules of a conservative self-policing art market that favors the status quo, instead preferring to make us squirm as he engages a host of lightning-rod issues facing our society today; homophobia, misogyny, racism, white nationalism, antisemitism and violence to name but a few. Wolfson is an art maker on the world stage whose immersive works take on today’s endemic virtue signaling and politically correct narratives, veritably throwing it all back into our faces.","popularity":0.5416,"poster_path":"/qBW43CoZidBMZqHPbaV0BTpvj8u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summitridge Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spit Earth: Who is Jordan Wolfson?","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Wolfson","original_name":"Jordan Wolfson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eaba719c8a2d4001d4a376e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Bankowsky","original_name":"Jack Bankowsky","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eaba72ec8a2d4001f4a4b13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrianna Campbell-LaFleur","original_name":"Andrianna Campbell-LaFleur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eaba740c8f3c40025a9a53c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Deitch","original_name":"Jeffrey Deitch","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eaba7530e597b001d876eea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy O.
