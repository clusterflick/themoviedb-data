Sybil is historically known as the “female Paul Revere” and is a wonderful example of courage and faith. Through this film we find the story of her family, neighbors, and friends, as they face the dynamics of the Revolution and lived their lives with courage, faith, and determination. This inspiriting story touches the lives of those who embrace it, as Sybil embraces her brothers and sisters and confronts the challenges before her. She stands courageously and boldly with determination, with her father, Col. Henry Ludington, as he faces the “price on his head” by the British. A movie that will inspire your family and the youth of today and go after everything before them with determination and courage.","popularity":0.135,"poster_path":"/AaPBIwvHfvQ24tuCCj93FzWfFsv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sybil Ludington","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micah Morgan","original_name":"Micah Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sybil Ludington","credit_id":"603003e9fab3fa003cfc460b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Copeland","original_name":"Robert Copeland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Colonel Henry Ludington","credit_id":"603003f5fd4a9600411b0983","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josiah Rizzo","original_name":"Josiah Rizzo","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Brock Dennison","credit_id":"60300404c3c891003fda1993","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Robinson","original_name":"Kim Robinson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6030041e1fb94f00418b1aa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1645934","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xGuaIHr5eG4WvQeEU0E13kuONOq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AaPBIwvHfvQ24tuCCj93FzWfFsv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253695,"name":"christian film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
