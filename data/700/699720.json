Due to the intensity of the father's attachment to his three daughters and his fear for them, he stopped working and stayed with them. But one day, he had to travel, the father’s news disappeared, and the three sisters believed that he had perished. Aouisha, the youngest daughter, professes deception to take care of her two sisters, and each time the sovereign \"Moulay Abid\" confronts her with a holster of the monument, she escapes him because of his excessive intelligence and his insight.","popularity":0.1419,"poster_path":"/jfCNn191ah6OsDhNkl9NqGqoRAg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Douiba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","title":"عويشة الدويبة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Aicha Douiba","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Aouicha Douiba","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2131425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sana Akroud","original_name":"Sana Akroud","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/aeCLhDUB6rWOOlmzkA5sFXr82UV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aouicha \"Douiba\"","credit_id":"5eae13d6edeb43001fc67993","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yassine Ahajjam","original_name":"Yassine Ahajjam","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":"/Aq7axp7OeA9r4mdlEWTqPmjj46v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Moulay Abded","credit_id":"5eae13e41a934f001ee967fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2623343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aicha Manaf","original_name":"Aicha Manaf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae140ecdbaff001cb0dd0a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2623344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siham Ezzoubir","original_name":"Siham Ezzoubir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae1423edeb430023c6788e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2623346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"الحسين برداوز","original_name":"الحسين برداوز","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae14931a934f0026e968a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":27667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salah Benmoussa","original_name":"Salah Benmoussa","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae14a30c3ec80025cc5064","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2218346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassan Mediaf","original_name":"Hassan Mediaf","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae14b527d9cc001bd049fd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2623347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanane Zouhdi","original_name":"Hanane Zouhdi","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae14d48863480020813508","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2623349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fatima Ali Boubakdy","original_name":"Fatima Ali Boubakdy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eae1524cdbaff001cb0de7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2623350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bahia Abdellah","original_name":"Bahia Abdellah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eae154b27d9cc001dd04392","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jfCNn191ah6OsDhNkl9NqGqoRAg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
