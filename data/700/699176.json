Two ‘underemployed hipsters’ take on a challenge set by ‘the richest living artist’: visit all eleven galleries around the world showing his spot paintings while the exhibition is on, and win a print made by his assistants and signed by him. The two figured out a way to do the trip for less than what they would eventually be able sell the print for, and turn a profit, or at least break even…if they manage to make it. 72 Trees explores the absurdity of markets, the people they meet on their journey and the aftermath.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9YVKYEEZo0H2qT1yLMZ3oW6ij4l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"72 Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Doyle","original_name":"Helena Doyle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eac3508c8f3c40025aa2dca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Cassina","original_name":"Eduardo Cassina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eac350dca0e17001c0bdac2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Doyle","original_name":"Helena Doyle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eac34efc8f3c4001daa25bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Cassina","original_name":"Eduardo Cassina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eac34fc1b157d001fc7fb21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9YVKYEEZo0H2qT1yLMZ3oW6ij4l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Alchemy","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"72 TREES TRAILER","key":"315252544","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-04T15:48:34.000Z","id":"5eac355701e4d100261d6501"}]}}}
