Doyle, like many of his contemporaries, has struggled to maintain a healthy balance between life and music. The evidence of years spent pursuing a completely original sound is all around him. It is in his eyes, in his home and in the voices of his family. This film tells the story of a man who managed to live through his relationship with music. Now nearly 70, Doyle seems to be defying those forces that would keep him as a footnote in the history of American music.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/qET6fZ3tI6rwooXfoCRiKHH3we1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life, Love and Hate of a Free Jazz Man and His Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2435592","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1017,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qET6fZ3tI6rwooXfoCRiKHH3we1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
