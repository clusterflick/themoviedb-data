This production, performed as part of Théâtre Impérial de Compiegne's purpose of reviving obscure French opera, is the only version of 'Dinorah' available on DVD, but it is a great production! The painterly pastoral settings and décor and rustic costumes are very easy on the eye. Opera traditionalists who dislike modern stagings will be delighted to know that this is a traditional production. Pierre Jourdan's stage direction is charming and always involving, never once falling into static movements or gestures, gratuitous distaste and irrelevance. With Isabelle Philippe, Armand Arapian and Frédéric Mazzotta. Conducted by Olivier Opebeek.","popularity":0.2344,"poster_path":"/6n5ydU177it0LgvFSRTrvntUkY8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101307,"logo_path":null,"name":"KULTUR VIDEO","origin_country":""},{"id":133098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre Impérial de Compiègne","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dinorah, or The Pardon of Ploërmel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Philippe","original_name":"Isabelle Philippe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dinorah","credit_id":"5eac2546c8f3c4001faa435d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Arapian","original_name":"Armand Arapian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hoël","credit_id":"5eac2553e329430021b48f38","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Mazzotta","original_name":"Frédéric Mazzotta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Corentin","credit_id":"5eac2562e32943001cb49156","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572099,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Carré","original_name":"Michel Carré","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/x3zZWBJPfk2zM3FIyQw8qoyT05g.jpg","credit_id":"5eac2792c8a2d4001e4abb6a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":352706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Jourdan","original_name":"Pierre Jourdan","popularity":0.1983,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eac2586676ce2001c1b9f21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Opedebeek","original_name":"Olivier Opedebeek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eac25711b157d001fc7eced","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558963,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","original_name":"Giacomo Meyerbeer","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eac25e2676ce2001e1b9d0c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Barbier","original_name":"Jules Barbier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zhVqhaYv2vyzWFHZCuno5iDZPHz.jpg","credit_id":"5eac27a4c8a2d4001e4abb76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4933458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9JNjDORt2KxmOFNSuxhzyKLg7qv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6n5ydU177it0LgvFSRTrvntUkY8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":1450,"name":"shepherd"},{"id":4402,"name":"peasant"},{"id":4663,"name":"lovers"},{"id":5864,"name":"pilgrimage"},{"id":10947,"name":"goat"},{"id":11826,"name":"cottage"},{"id":255834,"name":"rural life"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
