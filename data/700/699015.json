Friends since childhood, Kaienkwinehtha and Kasennakohe are members of the traditional community of Akwesasne on the U.S./Canada border. Together, they undertake a four-year rite of passage for adolescents, called Oheró:kon, or \"under the husk.\" The ceremony had been nearly extinct, a casualty of colonialism and intergenerational trauma; revived in the past decade by two traditional leaders, it has since flourished. Filmmaker Katsitsionni Fox has served as a mentor, or \"auntie,\" to many youth going through the passage rites.","popularity":0.6797,"poster_path":"/orHRxiDv4MLELXZlXMYg49r24jh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two Mohawk girls on a challenging journey to becoming women.","title":"Ohero:kon - Under the Husk","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2620360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsitsionni Fox","original_name":"Katsitsionni Fox","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab73c91b157d001dc725bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752894,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Victoria Catherine Chan","original_name":"Victoria Catherine Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42db9181a7fc00360dced4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908237,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francis Gauthier","original_name":"Francis Gauthier","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42dbb881a7fc00330cc96a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Esson","original_name":"Katja Esson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42db8247721500356129ce","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908237,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francis Gauthier","original_name":"Francis Gauthier","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42dbb299d5c30033b8ea2a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2620360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsitsionni Fox","original_name":"Katsitsionni Fox","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42db616eecee003554a9dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752893,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Rickard","original_name":"Paul Rickard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42db6a41a5610034cd33df","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752895,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marie-Cécile Dietlin","original_name":"Marie-Cécile Dietlin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42db9be86017003656cb3b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robby Baier","original_name":"Robby Baier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42dba741a5610031cc8ac9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2272677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shirley K.
