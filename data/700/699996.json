After a break from ‘Indarella’, Ralf Schmerberg presents a 98-minute trip through an illustrious decade of vividness that just happened, yesterday. His undying will to create urged the filmmaker to ransack his archive during this lockdown. Spanning all continents, crossing cultural boundaries and encompassing humanity; you browse through this poetry as you sip on the past and taste this passing phase even better. The Background score by the Berlin-based multi-art-collective Music Ashram is put together by Music Director Tobias Feltes. It creates an ambiance with ornate sounds; from gongs to drones, voices, electronic sounds and beyond. The film takes you in and out of dinners, parks, clubs, streets; and people's lives like a paradoxical rollercoaster. Vivid, bold, colourful and effervescent. ‘Yesterway’.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yesterway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Schmerberg","original_name":"Ralf Schmerberg","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaef39d0c3ec80025cd8278","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
