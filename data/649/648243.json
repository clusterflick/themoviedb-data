The truth, he says, is far more complicated. In this three-part series, he uncovers the continuous culture that was not destroyed by outside invaders, but rather strengthened by them. Travel with him as he makes ancient history come alive at the scenes of bloody battles and key archaeological sites that reveal the clues to this new view of early Britain.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/rL82NvGNqNhMNIWy86NYGJh68KU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Arthur's Britain","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2441942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Pryor","original_name":"Francis Pryor","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/nLfP6SI1ja3l4NGMWy5TCGXGHBM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself / Presenter","credit_id":"5dcde6f8cc277c0012e3ae5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2419675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Geake","original_name":"Helen Geake","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tFfT3XXCoC4wRtABck2VrAyYCKo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Dr. Helen Geake","credit_id":"67da725a1741ed1f01a1f4d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Härke","original_name":"Heinrich Härke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Archaeologist, University of Reading","credit_id":"67da738be8302533206caad9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5314244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Powlesland","original_name":"Dominic Powlesland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Archaeologist","credit_id":"67da73b6594cac1ee76cb01f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5105176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Copestake","original_name":"Timothy Copestake","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67da71ed2bea975f8da6d391","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rL82NvGNqNhMNIWy86NYGJh68KU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
