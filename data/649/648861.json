All very personal, and it goes on and on, perhaps of very little meaning to others, but of crucial importance to myself, a record not for Entertainment or Public Exhibition, but something to share with friends, one long evening. Maybe there is a letter to my friends about a very crucial journey back to Ithaca – and a present for Sebastian, something that he’ll rediscover when he’ll be approaching the age when I, Odysseus, began my own travels – this may serve him as a beginner’s map – the Fates will give him better ones.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/58p51DKrfFxakHFkmkf2S2QTofa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":228,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Education of Sebastian or Egypt Regained","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","credit_id":"5dd170f4fd6fa100187f4e93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/58p51DKrfFxakHFkmkf2S2QTofa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
