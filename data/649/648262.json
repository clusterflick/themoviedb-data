For conductor Roberto Abbado, the transposition of the action to the present day releases the energy of Rossini's music. At his disposal is a cast of top-quality vocalists such as the “refined bel canto artist(Bresciaoggi) Sonia Ganassi as Elcia, and the “outstanding” Dmitry Korchak as the Pharaoh's son, two lovers fatefully drawn into the political turmoil and catastrophes of their time. Also among the protagonists are the “thoroughly brilliant” (DeutschlandRadio Kultur) baritone Alex Esposito as Faraone and, in his Rossini Festival debut, young, full-bodied bass Riccardo Zanellato as Moses. Conductor Roberto Abbado “inspired his musicians to deliver a spectacular performance” (Salzburger Nachrichten).","popularity":0.3658,"poster_path":"/mUumjf4EcFoBM36dECjldl3waXg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mose in Egitto","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Zanellato","original_name":"Riccardo Zanellato","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lL1cLRwiPNVPYaKXv4tyBP9Zk0i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mose","credit_id":"5dce057379a1c300174838a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Esposito","original_name":"Alex Esposito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AbAWMb7rgmwwfaBSpztz5tNYsu4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Faraone","credit_id":"5dce058f79a1c300174838c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Ganassi","original_name":"Sonia Ganassi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/AnBgLKGrOXqmYQCc6vCtrjVXUaN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Elcia","credit_id":"5dce05b71d78f20014286468","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Korchak","original_name":"Dmitry Korchak","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/rqdJ7SmDU3hv0SitHW6FIkpXC8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Osiride","credit_id":"5dce05cdcc277c0014e429cd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421776,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roberto Abbado","original_name":"Roberto Abbado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dce05e71d78f2001227c514","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389308,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Leone Tottola","original_name":"Andrea Leone Tottola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dce062be263bb0017747e4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Vick","original_name":"Graham Vick","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dce060279a1c3001748390a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mUumjf4EcFoBM36dECjldl3waXg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
