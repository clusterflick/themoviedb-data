A meditation between science fiction, spirituality and ecology on our relationship with matter and with time and on the reasons for the environmental disaster we are experiencing. If the island, unlike the Earth, survives, it is perhaps because creatures like the pilgrims who ignore the idea of attachment and conditioning live in it and believe that we are part of a whole: â€œThe barriers known as children collapsed in an instant . They collapsed again, and again. Here I was, eternally, None. None on the island \".","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LE-TOI-ILE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2459926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Baroni","original_name":"Alberto Baroni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd0ad8657d3780018d7c0d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
