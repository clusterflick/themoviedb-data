A key figure in the cultural landscape of Valle d'Aosta and a reference for the audiovisual sector.\r The film is a journey that Michelangelo travels along with the director, on several dimensions. Physicist, discovering new places where Buffa, undaunted, with the naturalness and joy of a child, brings his enthusiasm and love for cinema around the north of Italy. Old places that retraces with a bit of nostalgia, where his cinema is born and how a swollen river swells and begins to overflow into the heads of its actors / spectators.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Filmeur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2459917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Mantione","original_name":"Daniele Mantione","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd0aca657d3780018d7bee2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
