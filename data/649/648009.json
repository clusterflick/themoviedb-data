Director Bonnie Sherr Klein (Not a Love Story, and Speaking Our Peace) has been a pioneer of women's cinema and an inspiration to a generation of filmmakers around the world. SHAMELESS: the ART of Disability marks Klein's return to a career interrupted by a catastrophic stroke in 1987. Always the activist, she now turns the lens on the world of disability culture, and ultimately, the transformative power of art.","popularity":0.0879,"poster_path":"/dzSn1qxGQrdjCOAJUkKtieKC1LW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SHAMELESS: The ART of Disability","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bonnie Sherr Klein","original_name":"Bonnie Sherr Klein","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcd0531b2e0740017826f22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5492464","wikidata_id":"Q7487521","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dzSn1qxGQrdjCOAJUkKtieKC1LW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
