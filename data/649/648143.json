The sheriff is crooked, too, so it is difficult for Gallegher and his friend, Detective Snead, to capture the Sundown Kid.  Gallegher and his colleagues work for the recall of the corrupt mayor of Brimstone, even though the mayor tries to stop them by force.  In Part 2, Gallegher buys and trains a horse, then is surprised when a local rancher is accused of murder. The boy is sure it is a frame-up, and he tries to help out.  Gallegher continues to help the rancher who has been framed for murder, and after he finds an incriminating watch, he is able to reach the trial just in time to save the day.","popularity":1.1944,"poster_path":"/sh9RkdAvW4bfDBPRJmKrJABF2sg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":193,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallegher Goes West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Mobley","original_name":"Roger Mobley","popularity":0.5292,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gallegher","credit_id":"5dcda023b2e0740017838121","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Dern","original_name":"Bruce Dern","popularity":1.7354,"profile_path":"/24aH1ahmFFImPiBA5N4NhemshH9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Turk","credit_id":"5dcda032cc277c0012e327f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Graves","original_name":"Peter Graves","popularity":0.8836,"profile_path":"/bK7Wf7qmKqixhKqzmBX3gNtzFcS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marshal Neimeyer","credit_id":"5dcda044cc277c0012e3282c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Weaver","original_name":"Dennis Weaver","popularity":0.8174,"profile_path":"/ed8NnlU9Kxtmwxb4Io4VlWSIY71.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"George Tucker, the Sundown Kid","credit_id":"5dcda05879a1c30017479c34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Teal","original_name":"Ray Teal","popularity":0.4266,"profile_path":"/5JYtuFjUENJUSIYMM342D1fMxrg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Snead","credit_id":"5dcda074e263bb001773a4bc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Sargent","original_name":"Joseph Sargent","popularity":0.5371,"profile_path":"/tdRughmKCOifv5nHJLSkrCGhG9J.jpg","credit_id":"5dcda08ab2e0740012838cf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sheldon","original_name":"James Sheldon","popularity":0.2532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcda09d1d78f2001427b3d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0561069","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sh9RkdAvW4bfDBPRJmKrJABF2sg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"4 Parts","release_date":"1966-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
