It's not just any place for her. That house looks a lot like one he saw in an old photo from 1919: the one built by his grandfather, and then abandoned by him to escape persecution against Jews during World War II.  We are in Jamna, a small country in the west of Ukraine that is now independent. The guards prevent anyone from passing, and no one knows why. And the inhabitants of the country are of almost no help.","popularity":0.0695,"poster_path":"/pgPmzmpVgGSUNT7E074SLugkrnO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way to the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Шлях до гір","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364075,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micol Roubini","original_name":"Micol Roubini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c9d37bf31f20043e11ca8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Maldi","original_name":"Davide Maldi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c9d1d894ed60042f3b443","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Maldi","original_name":"Davide Maldi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c9d12c8f85800434599f0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364075,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micol Roubini","original_name":"Micol Roubini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd0ad2357d3780018d7c038","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10129414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/pgPmzmpVgGSUNT7E074SLugkrnO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinéma du Réel","release_date":"2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
