The first date turns into a shopping spree, and after the new clothes come a new home. Since we write the year 1913 and at that time the cinema was still chaste, Max Mack saved us the details of the Techtelmechtel. To keep the story going, they both learn the new fashion dance: Tango, which Lieutenant Lulu has tried in vain. A tango competition makes the comedy a mix-up comedy: it wins - who wouldn't have thought it - Hanni as the tango queen.","popularity":0.1361,"poster_path":"/h7uofW4IgdBzosrQPtuxR1gL5aX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54469,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitascope GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1913-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tango Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Tangokönigin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanni Weisse","original_name":"Hanni Weisse","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/fDq6WaODfPI77hTRODOZyJ6HpNI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd985db76cbb0013750c34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Engl","original_name":"Olga Engl","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/bQqvSU7dQBrzj7A8ec5hq9RhX75.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"603105937f6c8d003e0fab92","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Mack","original_name":"Max Mack","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcd985479a1c300104770f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003431","wikidata_id":"Q23951322","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7uofW4IgdBzosrQPtuxR1gL5aX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
