Born in 1732 as the son of a humble wheelwright, Haydn grew up in a rural, peasant environment. That such a child should make his way eventually to the position of court composer was an extremely rare occurrence. Even in his days at royal courts, however, Haydn still felt a close and intimate attachment to Nature and to life in the countryside. When Baron Gottfried van Swieten, then, presented to Hadyn a libretto on the theme of The Seasons, he found in the old composer a worthy partner in his own veneration for Nature.","popularity":0.0525,"poster_path":"/AulUVILUovTwAjdSn6RZGwAuWTQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haydn The Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","original_name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/tkitTZcuAjS98Ogz59BjYnLcovm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dirigent","credit_id":"5dd14f08b76cbb00137bc912","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748738,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.
