Nevertheless, the splendid singing and acting transform the story, normally treated as farce, into something considerably more serious. As many other critics have noted, the young lovers have not yet sorted everything out as this performance ends. Act One begins with the principal characters running around in the outdoor theater -- while the audience takes it in as if they had been advised to sit back and enjoy the novelty. Very likely they were also asked to refrain from applauding at the end of arias and ensemble pieces, in which the three-hour opera abounds.","popularity":0.1009,"poster_path":"/6Qr8WeoiqZF0MmTO34k1RLSlRfB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2006-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":182,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosi Fan Tutte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Koch","original_name":"Sophie Koch","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/131B2Dd2tMylZgQPEBjkv8ZfQrS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dorabella","credit_id":"5dd164962d531a0013da6be4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana María Martínez","original_name":"Ana María Martínez","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fiordiligi","credit_id":"5dd164c4b76cbb00167bb36a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Degout","original_name":"Stephanie Degout","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guglielmo","credit_id":"5dd164eb2d531a0013da6c38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Mathey","original_name":"Shawn Mathey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"5dd1650857d3780015d9cd6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2095103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Donath","original_name":"Helen Donath","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/uqSalz0pTlLWtbrxSxA04XcJ41j.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Despina","credit_id":"5dd165382866fa00138a1428","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":314831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Allen","original_name":"Thomas Allen","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/7CtZcvNyySzaCd5SKxULs7bSLNl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Don Alfonso","credit_id":"5dd165552866fa00138a1468","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2192298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Honeck","original_name":"Manfred Honeck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dd165832d531a0015da96af","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffabf62fcec2e004116832e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl-Ernst Herrmann","original_name":"Karl-Ernst Herrmann","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd165a1b76cbb00137bf1c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","original_name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/mM38EiXvY2Oi7cLrvXdT6j0S2aa.jpg","credit_id":"5dd165b4b76cbb00137bf1cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"5dd165c62866fa00138a1586","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qf5iorh2I8XYhjJ47FrGkONPzqr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6Qr8WeoiqZF0MmTO34k1RLSlRfB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
