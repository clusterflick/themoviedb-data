According to Byron, this is his second “musical.” The first of these “musicals” was Les Preludes. Opening scenes in To Joy interchange from gardens of yellow flowers to a revolving carousel to a woman in Asian-inspired attire that is spinning an umbrella. Other scenes include a woman belly dancing, as well as young girls dancing ballet and participating in a maypole dance. At one of the To Joy film screenings, Byron was asked who “Joy” is. -Chicago Film Archives","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/e94mGutXWlzGYM6FO81fdAKKjpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byron Grush","original_name":"Byron Grush","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd140282866fa001389c7d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e94mGutXWlzGYM6FO81fdAKKjpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
