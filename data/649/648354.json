Over seventy years ago, although they lost their entire families, they survived the holocaust and resettled in New York City. Now they are sharing their stories in a unique program led by a drama therapist with high-school students in Brooklyn. The hope is that this sharing will sensitize the students and give some closure to the adult survivors after all these years. The Witness Theater workshop they participate in culminates in the performance of a play based on Survivor stories.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witness Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oren Rudavsky","original_name":"Oren Rudavsky","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bc5f0a7304b52384a1a4f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oren Rudavsky","original_name":"Oren Rudavsky","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bc5f1317b5ef04e4174efc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2458552,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zelda Greenstein","original_name":"Zelda Greenstein","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dce8fcee263bb00117537a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9017986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
