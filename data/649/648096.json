It is followed by a second film SPACESHIP EARTH showing on-going work on the new Space Shuttle.  APOLLO-SOYUZ was created prior to the actual mission, and uses footage from prior Apollo missions and concept art.

The docking module is shown at 1:52 and again at 2:43 when it was displayed at the 1973 Paris Air Show.","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":125298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockwell International","origin_country":""},{"id":48698,"logo_path":"/g93vV2z8Oh6xoTU3VJGBotsc02N.png","name":"NASA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apollo Soyuz Mission Overview & Space Shuttle Mission Profile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3Vl8oNyMWzdlg7SoDPavUmKfYse.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1432,"name":"nasa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
