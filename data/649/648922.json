Whittle’s film seeks to challenge conditions of racialised abjection and find new methods for refusal. A chief linkage is the sonic cosmologies found in Kamau Brathwaite’s research on ‘tidalectics’, and Christina Sharpe’s work on The Weather. Sharpe positions The Weather as a lens to understand the inescapable conditions within the afterlife of slavery, while Brathwaite’s theories of ‘tidalectics’ expose the performativity of sound, revealing memories of transoceanic life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rFwm1SHvefR7BXICdJITiWv0OBd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"between a whisper and a cry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2612182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberta Whittle","original_name":"Alberta Whittle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea1fafa3faba0002544071a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rFwm1SHvefR7BXICdJITiWv0OBd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":626}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
