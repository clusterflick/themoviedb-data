Rostropovich mastered the Schumann in several famous recordings. Here, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, he provides a splendid performance. Featuring his trademark powerful technique, smooth legato and crisp vibrato, the Romantic roots of the concerto are never hidden for long, despite the relatively cool playing of the Orchestre National de France.","popularity":0.2736,"poster_path":"/8rUkTa1umXQ9b8h0WEOUYOBizCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rostropovich Life & Art","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mstislav Rostropovich","original_name":"Mstislav Rostropovich","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/ricTUfQ80PtSGKyTZCfw9qINnNR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd1d934fd6fa100147ff6c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5dd1d94657d3780013da2a4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert von Karajan","original_name":"Herbert von Karajan","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/x5BINmghy56Hibqxpq9SVkPZouQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5dd1d95557d3780013da2a7a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Koch","original_name":"Ulrich Koch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd1dbdafd6fa100187ffc19","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2460861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernest Bloch","original_name":"Ernest Bloch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6387a1801b157d0082467ca3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"6387a16b229ae21581183c2b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46872,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Schumann","original_name":"Robert Schumann","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/6mqSHpDkRfEjETSKlpfOmfrQ2Z.jpg","credit_id":"6387a1511b157d00c9fa5171","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves-André Hubert","original_name":"Yves-André Hubert","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd1dba0b76cbb00117c8a48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd1da41b76cbb00117c8968","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1UfxfPMftaNLXFrcLzAffi0CE5O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8rUkTa1umXQ9b8h0WEOUYOBizCb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
