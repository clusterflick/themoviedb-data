Necktie Youth portrays this first post-apartheid gilded youth in striking black-and-white. Soft colours are reserved for their childhood memories of the early years of the rainbow nation. White 19-year-old Emily did not understand the codes of their set and could not take the pace of the ever-changing, fleeting liaisons, says the super cool, black and privileged September when he tries to explain to a TV reporter why Emily hung herself in her parents’ garden. She even positioned her camera in such a way that her suicide could be streamed live.","popularity":0.1522,"poster_path":"/kDG17c5Jqd52qvgB1iMbGZgaFVj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237679,"logo_path":"/e4grtrOY2NpxGyCAZOfKhKaXzmp.png","name":"100% Film & Photography","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2015-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Necktie Youth","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sibs Shongwe-La Mer","original_name":"Sibs Shongwe-La Mer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"September","credit_id":"563b769ac3a3681b5e02366f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonko Khoza","original_name":"Bonko Khoza","popularity":0.334,"profile_path":"/onR2oQuN1k69Ba24wHcHT89b6B5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jabz","credit_id":"563b76b99251417819001bed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Balchin","original_name":"Colleen Balchin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tanya","credit_id":"61b7811d9d8939008f733555","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3346534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamogelo Moloi","original_name":"Kamogelo Moloi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bogosi","credit_id":"61b7813bc616ac0043121262","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Tollman","original_name":"Emma Tollman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nikki","credit_id":"61b78170bfeb8b001dac3a58","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sibs Shongwe-La Mer","original_name":"Sibs Shongwe-La Mer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f35ebb9251416b380044f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sibs Shongwe-La Mer","original_name":"Sibs Shongwe-La Mer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b78195c616ac004312127e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762021,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chuanne Blofield","original_name":"Chuanne Blofield","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b781a6e263bb00887341c1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Trengove","original_name":"John Trengove","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/md15cLZZnD6vMzvNqYYkyRboMlD.jpg","credit_id":"640358de67dcc9007dbe4c0d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4515662","wikidata_id":"Q116196366","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OBCTVHEOTbWa4eGceBRFPyfTQP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/kDG17c5Jqd52qvgB1iMbGZgaFVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":735}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
