After awhile a space seems to emerge behind the screen.  The swiftly changing patterns generate an experience of soft floating motion, through a field of snowflakes that whirl about in the wind.  There is simultaneous serenity and agitation in the portrayed motions.  The background appears soft, almost quivering at first, as if alive, and the reddish color suggests warmth and contrast with the snow.  As the film progresses the snowflakes get smaller and better focused, yielding a kind of distance perspective and the background acquires more and more substantiality.  At some point and often quite suddenly, the trans-like floating experience is broken by the discovery of what lies ahead: a red brick wall!  The entire meaning of the earlier experience undergoes a sudden shift as this prototype of the impenetrable obstacle becomes apparent.\"â€“ Robert Becklen","popularity":0.4506,"poster_path":"/hwwIwPt0Rmdq572S4Ih72NIu5pu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"54f3bbdd9251417992000a45","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"54f3bbebc3a368512b0003de","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"54f3bbcdc3a3681deb0009ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":883,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hwwIwPt0Rmdq572S4Ih72NIu5pu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":589},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/30Jdx2pZvziyvRpgxavvcWNGaN1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4372,"name":"wall"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
