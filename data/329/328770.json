He served his country as an ace fighter pilot in Korea and was the last man to ever hit over .400 for a season. This story isn’t about how he lived, but about the mystery surrounding his world after his death. Williams’s head (yes, his head) is preserved in cryostasis in a facility in Arizona. How this came to be remains a mystery shrouded in claims that his children mistreated him and wrapped in a notorious dirty cocktail napkin.","popularity":0.1326,"poster_path":"/5N986xlUMoikt0R20UHZ2e0tlQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Immortal Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Williams","original_name":"Ted Williams","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/AoUJDltT9rVgRRZmjIkBrsgxh3u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2dd56e66e469246f7ffe3c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myles Kane","original_name":"Myles Kane","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/stSPcm0OpHr4y7wKuvoCjNk47Xz.jpg","credit_id":"55007d94c3a3685bab0018e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Koury","original_name":"Josh Koury","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/dXSv556ZQB0I0yvxA0H9lYrFjTq.jpg","credit_id":"55007d8b9251412872001204","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3963294","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5N986xlUMoikt0R20UHZ2e0tlQG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
