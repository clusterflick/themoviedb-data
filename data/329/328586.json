Hence it is when Isabelle appears on the scene clad in a gown that is a masterpiece of the dressmaker's art she easily fascinates the male contingent, among whom is Enrico, the sweetheart of Veronica, a street singer. Enrico is so enraptured at the sight of Isabelle in her resplendent attire that he becomes her abject slave, casting aside the poor, peasant-clad little Italian street singer, who has loved him devotedly. Crushed almost beyond endurance the poor girl stands sobbing at the entrance of the park where the inconsistent lever left her. Her tears attract the attention of a wealthy young couple who happen to pass. In answer to their queries she tells them how contemptibly her sweetheart acted, and all because of the fascinating influence of a gown.","popularity":0.3969,"poster_path":"/vsYa51BgHkjsmCKhYB1LC1FOl6V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lure of the Gown","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Isabelle","credit_id":"54f60a99925141240b0004a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Solter","original_name":"Harry Solter","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/2HWWlgqD4xYKZNwiSaD2BqPyAY2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Enrico","credit_id":"54f60aa0925141240b0004ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Lawrence","original_name":"Florence Lawrence","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/gpjntjA0Kbit4MUcPMM4KBLicpw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Veronica","credit_id":"54f60aadc3a3683a6e000541","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rich Woman","credit_id":"54f60ab6c3a3683a5d0004d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54f60ac0c3a3683a730004f4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele DeGarde","original_name":"Adele DeGarde","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/frdVYPfQMeCaygDxTwSnetDCPsg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Child on Street","credit_id":"54f60add925141240b0004b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Hendrie","original_name":"Anita Hendrie","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/9mUw7AhsLxTG667VTCOGnAPG8E3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Veronica's Partner","credit_id":"54f60ae59251415019000043","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Inslee","original_name":"Charles Inslee","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/adYzNqmBzmfGkFppoc8eHn2EHk5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Second Suitor","credit_id":"54f60af3c3a3683a65000502","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur V.
