The shadows play an essential part in the mixture of loneliness and peace that exists here. The seasons move from the garden into the house, projecting rich diagonals in the early morning or late afternoon. Each shadow is a subtle balance of stillness and movement; it shows the vital instability of space. Its special quality opens a passage to the subjective; a voice within the film speaks to memory. The walls are screens through which I pass to the inhabited privacy. We experience a place through the perspective of where we come from and hear another's voice through our own acoustic. The sense of place is never separate from the moment.\" – R.B.","popularity":0.1201,"poster_path":"/6wXsrFrjSgZcaHvpdpySiAbQHlt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Pitcher of Colored Light is tinged with a melancholy sense of time passed","title":"Pitcher of Colored Light","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Mahoney","original_name":"Dorothy Mahoney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"640f7a80af85de007b786809","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"54f5f6da92514106830002b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4506114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvN7i4yNDNq0TlTxWKiG420XssN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1298},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ygNl6pB8VyVaDKRwpGDWt2atgD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6wXsrFrjSgZcaHvpdpySiAbQHlt.jpg","vote_average":8.034,"vote_count":5,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9MF29hkND5LEJdNvYoUN7Nn3rkO.jpg","vote_average":1.444,"vote_count":6,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1057,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vucq2RS8BQXJv3CwFVewwRsOch5.jpg","vote_average":0.958,"vote_count":4,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Gloria Kino, Kassel","release_date":"2007-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"FilmSamstag, Kino Babylon","release_date":"2007-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
