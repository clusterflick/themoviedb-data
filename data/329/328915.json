Each year executives and managers ridicule the logic, sportswriters and broadcasters question the sanity, and athletes and fans cast blame. Yet not many people know how it is that the MLB schedule is figured out, and even fewer have any idea what is involved. The masterminds for 25 years behind this massive logistical undertaking were Henry and Holly Stephenson. A husband and wife duo working out of an upstairs bedroom in their Staten Island home with a computer, a pencil and a great deal of cooperation. How did this mom-and-pop team ever end up with the daunting and thankless job of MLB scheduling? This is the story of how the Stephensons landed their first MLB contract and became \"The Schedule Makers.\"","popularity":0.074,"poster_path":"/gsCYCnKWqdZWxHtOdex3C2hcAfP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Schedule Makers","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065353,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Garner","original_name":"Joseph Garner","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55007bacc3a3685ba2001bde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3316684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Dgmxe2933B8czyw7cL9dJx1TZO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gsCYCnKWqdZWxHtOdex3C2hcAfP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
