Shot entirely without dialogue, the film's innovative use of sound helps tell the story of a shepherd who leaves his wife and herd to settle in a nearby town. Since its premiere at the Alexandria Film Festival, Human Being (إنسان / Insan) has been shown in a number of festivals in the Middle East and Europe. This film is a prime example of experimental Arab cinema.","popularity":0.0772,"poster_path":"/qVB84cQjVvL3RhKtkeWskCauzcz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73245,"logo_path":null,"name":"State Corporation for Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human Being","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Human Being","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed M.
