That tends to happen when you build your football facilities on top of a swamp where the temperature averages over 80 degrees. Players often collapsed and were sent to the infirmary.

They called it Gatorade.","popularity":0.2178,"poster_path":"/3eGYoOpbmrV94OnGFdCAxTx9hAh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":204434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amdur Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":91182,"logo_path":null,"name":"RUMUR","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sweat Solution","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2624546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Spurrier","original_name":"Steve Spurrier","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b80266eee18600e37286d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Beilinson","original_name":"David Beilinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55007d6dc3a3685b9e00185c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Amdur","original_name":"Neil Amdur","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55007d76c3a3685b96001a3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suki Hawley","original_name":"Suki Hawley","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8015c55b0c000ffb0d547","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170418,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caroline D'Ambrosio","original_name":"Caroline D'Ambrosio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8021ffdc146011db9b979","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suki Hawley","original_name":"Suki Hawley","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b801405aadc400addbfff3","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Galinsky","original_name":"Michael Galinsky","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8014dd399e6012db4e873","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Galinsky","original_name":"Michael Galinsky","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b80133d399e600ca909741","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Beilinson","original_name":"David Beilinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b80168b1f68d00ae3403ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brett Epstein","original_name":"Brett Epstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8017a5aadc400ffb7ff38","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1737165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen McEneaney","original_name":"Kathleen McEneaney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b801a2d399e6012db4e899","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4447042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7w8N5oAdbvPwrfvVHqWAOK9fty.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifVtQlDlkGE1HwUYvBIzSePupNU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3eGYoOpbmrV94OnGFdCAxTx9hAh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wnhvhMPOPVHKYxiwSvZANOfZcjk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":546}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":10637,"name":"food"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Grantland \"30 for 30\"","release_date":"2015-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
