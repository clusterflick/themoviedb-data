He's the only player to start in four consecutive Final Fours, and was instrumental in Duke winning two national championships. He had looks, smarts and game. So why has Christian Laettner been disliked so intensely by so many for so long? Maybe it was the time he stomped on the chest of a downed player, or the battles he had with his teammates, or a perceived sense of entitlement. But sometimes, perception isn't reality. \"I Hate Christian Laettner\" will go beyond the polarizing persona to reveal the complete story behind this lightning rod of college basketball. Featuring extensive access to Laettner, previously unseen footage and perspectives from all sides, this film will be a \"gloves-off\" examination of the man who has been seen by many as the \"Blue Devil Himself.\"","popularity":1.9771,"poster_path":"/pdzT3ftIWJH7bdQyKI1gQS8SFgu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Perception isn't always reality","title":"I Hate Christian Laettner","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":38,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2987741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Laettner","original_name":"Christian Laettner","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/sD6YsUY1lmr8g4t8Ct5aVrKHZgY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6034b8086cf3d50041fbea22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Krzyzewski","original_name":"Mike Krzyzewski","popularity":0.079,"profile_path":"/bYKpTUTQpGr9kJEC9AkRJQ7vPcR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"576ac451c3a36863e900017c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jalen Rose","original_name":"Jalen Rose","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/yT5WvYpMLDTlJoDgyduZhbFAWgq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6034b885394a87003f747882","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Lowe","original_name":"Rob Lowe","popularity":2.0226,"profile_path":"/77decDyKXB34i9A1FnMM1suI5cA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f4b6d6c3a3683e27000163","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Jeong","original_name":"Ken Jeong","popularity":1.6408,"profile_path":"/dfuDZ2m2A8nBb0TdyeqmlPOobJA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f4b6dd9251416ad1000195","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verne Troyer","original_name":"Verne Troyer","popularity":0.6594,"profile_path":"/39XaEapy4czuHgsPHw5wzvVWWy6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f4b6eac3a3683e2b00017b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Karpf","original_name":"Rory Karpf","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e0f147c3a3683d0b0198e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Karpf","original_name":"Rory Karpf","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e0f14d9251415e3c01b34e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4300028","wikidata_id":"Q30675305","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":1275,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jZw8MtJVrnys1EZSk4CerPxzBJJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2272},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4S4QdNVPDJn7TkTvjRoimOVzy0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w97wTmzPTaZBR9nh986Fyon55Lv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fDonsfgWcSoImZy7XR5MNmfXF8c.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.003,"height":1290,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r0dNKb9lbm1FpgfPArUfPxbWVCE.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1294}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pdzT3ftIWJH7bdQyKI1gQS8SFgu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":30,"name":"individual"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":4235,"name":"duke"},{"id":6496,"name":"basketball"},{"id":14709,"name":"profile"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":249992,"name":"college basketball"},{"id":292954,"name":"acc"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Disney+","release_date":"2021-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I hate Christian Laettner | 30 for 30 Trailer | ESPN","key":"HNk19TXqnq0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-04-12T18:19:45.000Z","id":"650413a7ffc9de0ee20ad27a"}]}}}
