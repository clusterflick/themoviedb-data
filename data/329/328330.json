It was also the center of Polish culture and political activism in America. With Poland partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany, over 4,000,000 Poles immigrated to the United States between 1870 and 1920 in search of a better life. In Chicago, they worked in some of the most dangerous factories and mills in the United States. In their neighborhoods, they built communities, churches, and most of all, aided their beloved Poland in her fight for independence. Their story is known as the \"Fourth Partition\".","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/4nNKZw1Poh17REKe4ALjdJmWCuE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fourth Partition","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Prawica","original_name":"Adrian Prawica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b5997746457005892a4d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Prawica","original_name":"Adrian Prawica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b598e713ed40058d70c9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057034,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeton Murtishi","original_name":"Jeton Murtishi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b597729c62600597899be","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057031,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rafal Muskala","original_name":"Rafal Muskala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b595e8566d20058db4e46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Prawica","original_name":"Adrian Prawica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b593ff6787a00299b6dac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057035,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Slawomir Bielawiec","original_name":"Slawomir Bielawiec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b5982031deb0029a87ba4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Prawica","original_name":"Adrian Prawica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b594d29c6260059789991","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Prawica","original_name":"Adrian Prawica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b596af6787a0058f8f28b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3237768","wikidata_id":"Q19878042","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4nNKZw1Poh17REKe4ALjdJmWCuE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
