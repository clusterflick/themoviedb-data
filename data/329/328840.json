But even more compelling than the stories he's been apart of onscreen are those he tells offscreen. In 'The Primary Instinct,' Stephen plays himself and uses the art of storytelling to take the audience through a riveting and moving journey about life, love, and Hollywood. Along the way, he just may answer one of the questions that's dogged humanity since the beginning of time: Why do we tell stories in the first place?","popularity":0.6147,"poster_path":"/pTcd2iUWs9dVVIxGiD3X9yik13e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15722,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmBuff","origin_country":""},{"id":47851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cut","origin_country":""},{"id":51910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bright
