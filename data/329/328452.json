Bryan Wizemann's haunting and elegiac feature film debut is a contemporary portrait of ritual and superstition, intimacy and estrangement. In direct contrast with the current zeitgeist of a Las Vegas myth, LOSING GROUND is a personal and closely observed work on the addictions of human nature.","popularity":0.0519,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Losing Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0446001","wikidata_id":"Q6683635","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
