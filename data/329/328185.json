They go separately to school, sleep in the same bed and listen to the same name Thomas. The brothers look very similar, but their personalities are different. Only the passion for painting brings the twins together. After years of keeping their existence away from the world, the twins decide to follow their big dream. They want to become painters. The brothers leave their father, move into a house near a city and begin to work hard for success.

years.","popularity":0.1808,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neben
