Even though Tsuchiya is on the left, he ended up marrying the singer for that band, Karin Amamiya, who has since emerged as a spokesperson for disaffected Japanese youth in the media. The New God won an award at the 1999 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival.","popularity":0.4018,"poster_path":"/rrcB7B7bv10k980IoxIsPj41zte.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190263,"logo_path":null,"name":"W-TV Office","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New God","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Tsuchiya","original_name":"土屋豊","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/6GSGA2Mbntc3fwnMOGXTTHjsV2d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54f6abef92514124050016e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1434828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karin Amemiya","original_name":"Karin Amemiya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf6b8e05a533007c7dde18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hidehito Itô","original_name":"Hidehito Itô","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54f6abe89251416ee4000b42","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Tsuchiya","original_name":"土屋豊","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/6GSGA2Mbntc3fwnMOGXTTHjsV2d.jpg","credit_id":"54f6abd492514124050016de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Tsuchiya","original_name":"土屋豊","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/6GSGA2Mbntc3fwnMOGXTTHjsV2d.jpg","credit_id":"63bf6c7e8efe7300f0a2289a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Tsuchiya","original_name":"土屋豊","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/6GSGA2Mbntc3fwnMOGXTTHjsV2d.jpg","credit_id":"63bf6c77e16e5a007ea93d9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1434828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karin Amemiya","original_name":"Karin Amemiya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bf6c85a5743d00b0be7fba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0252242","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/rrcB7B7bv10k980IoxIsPj41zte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":777,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/nb8kyP1lLpCJLstoVzjXj93Lgxf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":1628,"name":"nationalism"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":33858,"name":"right wing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"新しい神様 - The New God (Japanese Patriot Documentary)","key":"Q_2-FMgPHf0","published_at":"2013-11-11T20:25:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"5954c1e09251412b3104cce7"}]}}}
