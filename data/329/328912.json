Johnnie, five years Arthur's junior, returned from his first tour in Vietnam with the Marines. At the time, Arthur Ashe was a lieutenant in the Army working at West Point in data processing while fast becoming a rising star in the tennis world. When Johnnie was sent home however, Arthur suddenly became in danger of being sent to Vietnam. Johnnie volunteered to be sent back to the war in his brother's place so that Arthur could continue his budding tennis career. Johnnie would return home, and Arthur would go on to win the inaugural 1968 U.S. Open en route to a Hall of Fame career in tennis, made possible by his brother's selflessness.","popularity":0.2346,"poster_path":"/5qb3vK4YuqAxKME7HNVYEQzcmh8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arthur & Johnnie","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tate Donovan","original_name":"Tate Donovan","popularity":0.9848,"profile_path":"/uYgYbd842mtRY66Ehw441aKkOC5.jpg","credit_id":"55007b81c3a3685b9b00184e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3173584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5qb3vK4YuqAxKME7HNVYEQzcmh8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZdzey4YpYTsLAlvT0G0n1oJC73.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJE0jBgem6q1lW1EZ5HwNOf9vLr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dMV042Cm6j1nx2vfDi7PWiYnwlb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
