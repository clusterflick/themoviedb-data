Samson is a member of this society, a young man trying to maintain his family working as a gardener at the aqueduct; his worries are bearable thanks to the love for his wife and his three kids. Maneno is a teenager with no interest in studying and spends his time on the play station and watching European soccer, but now, since a few days ago, a wound on his shoulder has started to give him problems. Dixon, known as Mr White by his neighborers, is an almost 20.
