Although the original play was set in an unspecified, but distant past, the film relocates the story to modern day India. The film tells the story of a Bengali merchant from Kolkata and his servant who visit a small town for a business appointment, but, whilst there, are mistaken for a pair of locals, leading to much confusion.","popularity":0.2522,"poster_path":"/sGHcGSLTnIip1Qq6nuVx4aIvInm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1963-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bhrantibilas","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"भ्रांति बिलास","type":"Hindi"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uttam Kumar","original_name":"Uttam Kumar","popularity":0.5308,"profile_path":"/zHgKB4Ssdqc5KHZvnzV3SEiZKPt.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54f887979251412411004ade","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabitri Chatterjee","original_name":"Sabitri Chatterjee","popularity":0.2397,"profile_path":"/8fURygxLLaaI6hI8ERuwiuPOF1r.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63c9ff77bb070d0084e42593","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bhanu Banerjee","original_name":"Bhanu Banerjee","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/rBOM5khanFAUyBn0yTRVUAWXvCT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63123a09e63571007a5b983c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chhaya Devi","original_name":"Chhaya Devi","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/x8uKV8mWfFQytCanKLWi5Pyz2Ao.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63123a600d2944007e8443f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandhya Roy","original_name":"Sandhya Roy","popularity":0.3648,"profile_path":"/eFLcsQMaToTk3Uvcwbf8eRJvtA3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63123a588c7b0f007ab0e543","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3417037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manu Sen","original_name":"Manu Sen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/6i9vPGhs4cJhrUBXF3xABKWemWV.jpg","credit_id":"63123a740d2944007e8443fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2609170","wikidata_id":"Q15955726","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGHcGSLTnIip1Qq6nuVx4aIvInm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
