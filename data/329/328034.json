The mysterious killer also catches a shady lawyer. Higgins and Lane find out that the key to the crimes is an unsolved diamond heist from jeweler Bolden. It looks like those involved are fighting over the loot. Eventually, it turns out that the \"robbery\" was actually a set-up insurance scam that Bolden was personally behind and that killed his employee. Shortly before the last survivor is sent to the afterlife, Higgins and Lane are able to confront the \"invisible\" murderer.","popularity":0.7876,"poster_path":"/faxNESsdVKEn6ngi8LdszlkBUXc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42272,"logo_path":"/2bAuO4EvS59O1uXZQAKXG0HIXQg.png","name":"RTL","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":29165,"logo_path":"/d1wokdgTjC7lJs6yktVd61JZrwD.png","name":"Rialto Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die unheimlichen Briefe","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Edgar Wallace - Die unheimlichen Briefe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunter Berger","original_name":"Gunter Berger","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/jofxyROCDTMUBq84L6Csv43ce2y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Inspektor Higgins","credit_id":"54f2fa20c3a3683245003bba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariella Ahrens","original_name":"Mariella Ahrens","popularity":0.2523,"profile_path":"/fC28huX80EToZmRwgn2wSw2nchc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Barbara Lane","credit_id":"54f2fa39c3a368323e003894","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddi Arent","original_name":"Eddi Arent","popularity":0.3197,"profile_path":"/8HXFKjtsM7jpDL8NZHuUiy3vYN6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sir John","credit_id":"54f2fa4b9251416b35003a71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1148611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosalind Baffoe","original_name":"Rosalind Baffoe","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ann Pattison","credit_id":"54f2fa5ec3a368323e00389e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Schenk","original_name":"Udo Schenk","popularity":0.4922,"profile_path":"/nayRiG68Czv4SRrzThzWA69rPAO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"William Bolden","credit_id":"54f2fa72c3a368323e0038a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Richter","original_name":"Julia Richter","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":"/eNKaejQvsPZX0KEfr0X3Io0zve3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Peggy Lynch","credit_id":"54f2fa849251416b3b003a53","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Vita","original_name":"Helen Vita","popularity":0.1554,"profile_path":"/3T2ttjqhghxl1m0xN20wUtZKgZC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lady Upperworth","credit_id":"54f2fa9ac3a368322f00396e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Ebner","original_name":"Eva Ebner","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/nAWQp0hGcpCOLwpAubHb2zpiXSI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Thinwhister","credit_id":"54f2fab6c3a3683242003a3e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Lehmann","original_name":"Klaus Lehmann","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Stephen Scott","credit_id":"54f2fad39251416b3b003a62","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Lukac","original_name":"Peggy Lukac","popularity":0.3706,"profile_path":"/ejfbSXlgrNfxeeonOrLHpin3nqY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ruth Bolden","credit_id":"54f2fae49251416b31003b86","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.H.
