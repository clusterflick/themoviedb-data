The interviews will tell the stories of four generations of American women grappling with the status of their rights, the issues they face and how these have impacted our society. Kamala will talk with women from the well-known, such as Patricia Arquette, and Gloria Steinem to the unknown, including gang girls and hotel maids, to ask how being female impacts daily life, whether economically, politically or socially.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Equal Meets Equal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
