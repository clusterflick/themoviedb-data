Message from Mungo focuses on the interface over the last 40 years between the scientists on one hand, and, on the other, the Indigenous communities who identify with the land and with the human remains revealed at the site. This interface has often been deeply troubled and contentious, but within the conflict and its gradual resolution lies a moving story of the progressive empowerment of the traditional custodians of the area.","popularity":0.2905,"poster_path":"/iS4TwgwvdJ8UUgdammfLQpci5w6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":"/qildaLRTmB6fCBM3H7L02nQCreO.png","name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Repatriation is one of the most important social issues for Indigenous communities around the world.","title":"Message from Mungo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Kelly","original_name":"Alice Kelly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"54f61ed992514151c600044b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tibby Briar","original_name":"Tibby Briar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"54f61eecc3a3683a5a0008a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Bugmy","original_name":"Alice Bugmy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"54f61efcc3a3683a7300094e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel McBryde","original_name":"Isabel McBryde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"54f61f24c3a3683a6500099a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Pike","original_name":"Andrew Pike","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f61ea49251412402000909","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann McGrath","original_name":"Ann McGrath","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f61eb2c3a3683a690008d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1949,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kHDA8Ogp3qmRpVID38c8z7ZxyFt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3465}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2154,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iS4TwgwvdJ8UUgdammfLQpci5w6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":193459,"name":"australian aboriginal"},{"id":209702,"name":"repatriation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Byron Bay International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Stronger Than Fiction Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2014-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Canberra, Australia","release_date":"2014-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Message from Mungo - Trailer","key":"JOuHgVss9Wk","published_at":"2014-12-02T04:26:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54f61f93925141240b0008b4"}]}}}
