Thomas (Christophe Malavoy) has been blackmailed into carrying a shipment of explosives in his Peugeot to Egypt, where the devices will be forwarded to guerrillas on Cyprus. He brings his lover Veronique (Victoria Abril) along for the dangerous ride from Switzerland to the south, knowing the explosives can be easily detonated by accident and enemy agents as well as government agents are out to capture him. Both protagonists have a short fuse themselves, and as they separate and then come back together, their final destination looms ever closer in more ways than one.","popularity":0.2724,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le voyage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Abril","original_name":"Victoria Abril","popularity":0.9555,"profile_path":"/eXI42Fp7MIGHxEzmAX20I94CZi6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Véronique","credit_id":"54f89f56c3a368351d0044f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Malavoy","original_name":"Christophe Malavoy","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/4dNe1odZn3SBza3KVLDT0glp5wP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"54f89f5ec3a368126c001afa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Cavallo","original_name":"Victor Cavallo","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/iwbRCJCVlFkTTrUfkJE01rwzDG0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yannis","credit_id":"60b7a20e6905fb006f6197ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1514596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michaël Jacob","original_name":"Michaël Jacob","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Karl","credit_id":"60b7a21618b75100419a20ca","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renan Pollès","original_name":"Renan Pollès","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b7a2a1eda4b700599fbecb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Andrieu","original_name":"Michel Andrieu","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b7a229abf8e200596d7cd4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert De Zaltza","original_name":"Herbert De Zaltza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b7a2516905fb0040871ed2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léon Desclozeaux","original_name":"Léon Desclozeaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b7a28edfaae900577dc34a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883777,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maureen Mazurek","original_name":"Maureen Mazurek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b7a2aa57d378006f77c48a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Andrieu","original_name":"Michel Andrieu","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f89f34c3a36833bb004b0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088364","wikidata_id":"Q61782437","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
