On the court, she was nearly as dominant as Jordan, winning a national championship with Texas Tech, three Olympic gold medals, three MVP awards and four consecutive championships with the Houston Comets of the WNBA, the league she helped start. She even had a Nike shoe named after her, the Air Swoopes. Off the court, she has had a life full of transitions. She gave birth to her son, Jordan, during the inaugural season of the WNBA. Later, she divorced her high school sweetheart and became the highest-profile athlete in her sport to acknowledge she was gay.  She has struggled with love, money and personal identity, but has never lost her spirit. In this portrait, you will meet someone who is not your everyday superstar, but a woman who has defied a multitude of labels.","popularity":0.8863,"poster_path":"/7IVmqpc31Y87e0cLJNNg7gHFUC9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In transition... on and off the court","title":"Swoopes","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheryl Swoopes","original_name":"Sheryl Swoopes","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/yA6yTZChgBR6PG3zc6jhy3jfs1M.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"641f7a0508cf87007f37d8e2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Storm","original_name":"Hannah Storm","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648f672e42bf0100e49f4082","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2060536,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katie Walsh","original_name":"Katie Walsh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a9964369ea4865f79343fa","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2979878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7IVmqpc31Y87e0cLJNNg7gHFUC9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":163097,"name":"female athlete"},{"id":176752,"name":"basketball player"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":195624,"name":"black lgbt"},{"id":208820,"name":"olympic athlete"},{"id":215754,"name":"professional athlete"},{"id":264386,"name":"lesbian"},{"id":280190,"name":"women's national basketball association (wnba)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
