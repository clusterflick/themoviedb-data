It was a decade when seminal bands like Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Government Issue, Scream, Void, Faith, Rites of Spring, Marginal Man, Fugazi, and others released their own records and booked their own shows-without major record label constraints or mainstream media scrutiny. Contextually, it was a cultural watershed that predated the alternative music explosion of the 1990s (and the industry's subsequent implosion). Thirty years later, DC's original DIY punk spirit serves as a reminder of the hopefulness of youth, the power of community and the strength of conviction.","popularity":1.3755,"poster_path":"/jkcYRSver7hFK8OxTMQ6hrVb8UZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53577,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Rose Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salad Days: A Decade of Punk in Washington, DC (1980-90)","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Salad Days: The DC Punk Revolution Documentary","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Salad Days - 1980-1990: A Decade of Punk In Washington, DC","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Armisen","original_name":"Fred Armisen","popularity":1.1901,"profile_path":"/nLMCRlt0MV2uu4KPbDPDNsPWfBG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f3fdbbc3a3681de00015b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":533061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Grohl","original_name":"Dave Grohl","popularity":1.0756,"profile_path":"/hDfFm3lLPcdupe3PDucZdidKFBI.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55583b1c92514133f40011be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacKaye","original_name":"Ian MacKaye","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/hWGVc8Ng7o6IxGCv7dDH9gZugF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f3fda3925141799d001322","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurston Moore","original_name":"Thurston Moore","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/5MFuvfhH1S0X6lTrJxq3QywG0Dn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f3fdc79251410c3e000e3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Rollins","original_name":"Henry Rollins","popularity":0.8415,"profile_path":"/2E0cZdoJsdt1Lv4waG3s6fsfJeU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f3fdb092514179920013ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
