Hailed as the father of Natural History film, Smith was a hugely influential visual pioneer, inventing many techniques that are still used today. Being both a genius and an eccentric, we follow his life from his earliest films, to the collapse of his house from his mould experiment to his ultimate suicide. We also meet Natural History icon Sir David Attenborough, who was so amazed by Smithâ€™s films in the 1930s that they inspired him to get into natural history.","popularity":0.8556,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81126,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Media Museum","origin_country":""},{"id":81125,"logo_path":null,"name":"BFI National Archive","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":59143,"logo_path":"/8A78H5sMVZZtEBlHyB6IJjqnLLT.png","name":"Mentorn Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edwardian Insects on Film","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Hamilton James","original_name":"Charlie Hamilton James","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/oZC6Pstqx2N7hROoNmi3o1AFSsH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
