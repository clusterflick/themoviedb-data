As she attempts to uncover the truth about what happened, Jan learns that this specific lynching was iconic in American history, because photos of it were the first ever to be published in a national publication. Both Time and Life magazines carried the story and the photos, as they reported on the anti-lynching bill that was before Congress at that very moment. Additionally, she realizes that no names of the lynchers were ever published. Even the photographer was protected by a cloak of agreed-upon anonymity. Shaken by this stark reflection of white privilege and the brutality it sought to minimize, Jan must now reckon with deeply conflicted feelings about the father she loved, find a way to hold her family accountable, and face the dawning awareness of her own unconscious racism.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uS8kXwwPWIpX0Gu9DouavH5VZdQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father's Name","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Frazier","original_name":"Jan Frazier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67f99e2d7f70ac1a21d98cb4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanna Styron","original_name":"Susanna Styron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f99db2de5e4dec62ad8c2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uS8kXwwPWIpX0Gu9DouavH5VZdQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
