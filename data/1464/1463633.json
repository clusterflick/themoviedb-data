The story follows Don Pedro, Prince of Portugal, who has fallen in love with Doña Inês de Castro, a lady-in-waiting of the Infanta -- Pedro's would-be wife. The sweethearts are married in secret, to the fury of the King, and the ensuing drama combines events in the real world with the two lovers' dreams and visions. The choreography is set to a selection of pieces by the quintessential composer of ballet music, Tchaikovsky.","popularity":0.1021,"poster_path":"/pFkwlTmhGdY78djkSSHpVm1wHau.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theatre du
