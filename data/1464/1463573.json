This one tells the story of the human body's sensory system, including the operation of the inner ear. The film tells the story of Hank Morgan, a man of \"unwavering power and concentration\" and takes a peek inside his head to see how decisions are made. Unfortunately for Morgan, he trusts his inner ear and not his instruments, leading to a near crash.","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":"/pXSXBGfoNSxkDu79wggLYK6iLTj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8409,"logo_path":"/osYFlsgvFQXfEBAlvUgvWQHINLB.png","name":"United Productions of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on the HENRY MORGAN uncensored, unabridged unpublished best seller \"INSIDE MORGAN'S HEAD\".","title":"About Sensations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Inside Morgan's Head","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pXSXBGfoNSxkDu79wggLYK6iLTj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
