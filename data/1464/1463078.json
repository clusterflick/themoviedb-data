Rare archive footage and dreamlike sequences of present-day Hackney are juxtaposed with the East London paintings of Leon Kossoff, Jock McFadyen and James MacKinnon and a heightened soundtrack mixes documentary with poetry, music, song and location recordings.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":"/9ofaTQEXVFxpH5SYsik5FmF0o0o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Cranes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5366121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma-Louise Williams","original_name":"Emma-Louise Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9aeda7b43bdce20aeb1e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5366123,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Rosen","original_name":"Michael Rosen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9af0c1bc639566ada6a5d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2678754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9ofaTQEXVFxpH5SYsik5FmF0o0o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1434}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
