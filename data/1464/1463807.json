What unfolds is either a dream, a dying vision, or both. Then â€” reality returns with a quiet whimper. Life moves on. Raw, lo-fi, and unapologetically rough, this is a meditation on how easily the world forgets. Meaning is left open; interpretation belongs to the viewer.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":"/4P4lTC5ehR5gfpqh0JJSzKZgBL6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A man, a payphone, a moment lost in time.","title":"BUDKA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4536327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilya Romanov","original_name":"Ilya Romanov","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/lYfSou705Y2zzj22KNaxSP6ivlO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Man","credit_id":"67fba3fe765c5222f3991a56","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","original_name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fba40d3110bd82dfacf2e2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","original_name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fba419ec22ba3b49d93ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","original_name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fba4491bc639566adaeeb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfAMa9r0BUuNpRfzEvhOWTMYyYU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4P4lTC5ehR5gfpqh0JJSzKZgBL6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3755,"name":"transience"},{"id":9957,"name":"loneliness"},{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":207825,"name":"connection"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":348124,"name":"dream vs reality"},{"id":350820,"name":"urban isolation"},{"id":350821,"name":"imperfect cinema"},{"id":350822,"name":"lo-fi aesthetics"},{"id":350823,"name":"webcam filmmaking"},{"id":350824,"name":"existential reflection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"University screening of the Imperfect Cinema Module for Year 2 Students","release_date":"2025-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
