It delivers powerful voices of regional Indigenous leaders delivering somber and urgent narratives. Tribute to the Orca highlights Indigenous communities' ancient kinship with orcas and salmon, and the importance of reciprocity in our relationship with our caretaker: Mother Nature. A special focus is on the Southern Resident orcas whose survival, like the survival of Indigenous lifeways here in the Pacific Northwest, depends on scha’enexw (the Salmon People).  The event and film are a project of Se’Si’Le, an Indigenous-led nonprofit organization based in the Bellingham, WA in collaboration with Salish Sea and Northern Straits Native Nations, Save our Wild Salmon and Washington Conservation Action.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tFE3WgZuZSA7IzdPvFlMSBXJkFh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Our Relations: Tribute to the Orca","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Titus","original_name":"Mark Titus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fabff61f3bcfea48d953df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Florian Graner","original_name":"Florian Graner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fac00eec22ba3b49d90df4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368257,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Troll","original_name":"Patrick Troll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fac046c74c16bf88ad0440","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1384,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tFE3WgZuZSA7IzdPvFlMSBXJkFh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":923}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tribute - REEL - Chenoa","key":"1061057049","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-27T22:10:17.000Z","id":"67fabf8dea80d851759a09a9"}]}}}
