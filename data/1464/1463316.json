Which university he will attend, and what career path to pursue: music or law? Through this immersive portrait, we follow Flavio through days loaded with classes, trumpet lessons, and visits with friends (often on the trains that encircle the city and whose schedules Flavio knows by heart). Though he lacks much of his vision, he interacts with the world around him with a rare courage, fully embracing his disability and not letting his ambition or his passion for life be hindered.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/fdYb8OYeCE83YBEtWKvEkxWr3UA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Wandering Flavio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flavio Mendès","original_name":"Flavio Mendès","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b341f3bcfea48d928f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Théotime Berthaud","original_name":"Théotime Berthaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b3e1bc639566ada9d18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Auguste Roy","original_name":"Paul Auguste Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b4ade5e4dec62adb47a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mairame Dieng","original_name":"Mairame Dieng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b551f3bcfea48d92909","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Shoush","original_name":"Caroline Shoush","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b61d4c444a1cc9a0d0d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoire Chmakoff","original_name":"Victoire Chmakoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b701f3bcfea48d9291c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Baptiste Bridon","original_name":"Jean-Baptiste Bridon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b7bd3ab7d7a8badd8c4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Céline Chopin","original_name":"Céline Chopin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b8bea80d8517599f8bb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Bezy","original_name":"Charles Bezy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fa5b991bc639566ada9d39","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Liesse","original_name":"Marie Liesse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa5a63d4c444a1cc9a0cbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Liesse","original_name":"Marie Liesse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa5a6bd3ab7d7a8badd8af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Liesse","original_name":"Marie Liesse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa5a7d1f3bcfea48d928ae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3551164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Coline Beuvelet","original_name":"Coline Beuvelet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa5a87d4c444a1cc9a0ccd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4zj19gYMGxaD7Esg2LcLsJ0a0Dq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fdYb8OYeCE83YBEtWKvEkxWr3UA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/eo2TDDv1gPec7bMBzHJAL7cpHA3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Atlanta Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
