It explores the climate crisis through the eyes of Alaskaâ€™s Indigenous peoples as they utilize their ancestral knowledge and modern science to adapt to the changing rhythms of seasons, cycles, and movements across eroding lands and melting Arctic ice. The global impact of the story feeds into the current and worldwide surge of politically conscious indigenous peoples demanding human rights, food sovereignty, and self-governance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lrPrbSIBR4uQvdORkKlC5U5X9I6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Survive.
