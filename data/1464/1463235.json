This 10,220 km² territory is home to 1,335 known species of animal and 2,700 known species of plant, with no doubt many more to discover. The Kichwas and Huaoranis live here, as do the Tagaeri and Taromenane communities in voluntary isolation. For several decades now, these root peoples have seen their territory and culture threatened by oil extraction activities. They are fighting to raise awareness of the richness of the forest and the importance of protecting it. At the end of 2023, a team of scientists led by herpetologist (reptile and amphibian specialist) Damien Lecouvey spent 30 days and 30 nights in the jungle. Their objective: to inventory potential new animal and plant species, and take stock of known species, in order to help preserve them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jW0Z19siE9tNBk3FlA2kpzsy9Un.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Écailles de la forêt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5366828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Perrogon","original_name":"Lucas Perrogon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa2b4dde5e4dec62adaadb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5366830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manon Kole","original_name":"Manon Kole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa2b60ea80d8517599ed40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5366828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Perrogon","original_name":"Lucas Perrogon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa2b73ea80d8517599ed47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5366830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manon Kole","original_name":"Manon Kole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa2b801bc639566ada91d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2WvKd2p4FOp44H86PbXIdZpkbV8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jW0Z19siE9tNBk3FlA2kpzsy9Un.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
