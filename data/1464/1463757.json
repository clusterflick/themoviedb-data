They work as construction workers in the outskirts of Lisbon. The two of them share a converted garage with three others illegal Ukrainian immigrants. Their life in the garage is very basic and dull, but their inner life is full of contradictory feelings and nostalgia. The film describes their final months in voluntary exile, when yearning for home becomes more acute while the question of prolonging their stay arises. Finally, they leave Portugal and the film follows their first days in their own country. What kind of dreams can give them the strength to live and survive in these inhuman conditions in a faraway land?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5VB0CUWLpMNyqS2bEkjX3ReW6R0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84435,"logo_path":"/va5P5ZaSRJCSh4H6l220slFKae7.png","name":"Laranja Azul","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2003-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Between Walls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Filipe Costa","original_name":"José Filipe Costa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/eekeJLVfFmGv6wO3QfegpYrDHQP.jpg","credit_id":"67fb86e61ce4a3fb1cd910b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Ribeiro","original_name":"João Ribeiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fb86faaacf7cfb26993b86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Filipe Costa","original_name":"José Filipe Costa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/eekeJLVfFmGv6wO3QfegpYrDHQP.jpg","credit_id":"67fb878ed3ab7d7a8bae0a30","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369231,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"João Ribeiro","original_name":"João Ribeiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fb87b91ce4a3fb1cd910ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrijana Stojković","original_name":"Andrijana Stojković","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fb87c7ec22ba3b49d93056","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11059108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cOIEMbEoWthRcJ3PiRnQ1SAtswS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2562}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5VB0CUWLpMNyqS2bEkjX3ReW6R0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1681}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
