This one shows viewers how a Navy pilot’s cavalier attitude to training and safety lead to his fatal plane crash. The film opens with a fighter jet crash landing in the desert. The pilot, “Mr. Smith,” is killed in the crash. An investigative journalist interviews people who knew Smith, and everyone commented about how they knew him as “Indestructible Smith,” which lead to his disregard for safety precautions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gONcuop1DdKeSmBUUTprWTNSLVE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8409,"logo_path":"/osYFlsgvFQXfEBAlvUgvWQHINLB.png","name":"United Productions of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Accident Injury Prevention","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gONcuop1DdKeSmBUUTprWTNSLVE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
