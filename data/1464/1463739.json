In the third year of the Jianyan period (1129 AD), in Lin’an City, rebels forced Emperor Gaozong to abdicate. In this moment of crisis, Madam Liang Hongyu courageously left her infant son and traveled hundreds of miles overnight to Xiu State. There, she and her husband Han Shizhong devised a plan to stabilize the situation, protect the inner court, and quell the rebellion through a series of coordinated actions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gtaLJgVH95OgCa32vyVUpL2HgcZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madam Liang Hongyu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dong Yuanyuan","original_name":"Dong Yuanyuan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67fb7f911bc639566adae953","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liu Xuezhong","original_name":"Liu Xuezhong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fb7f7ca04f530b5c997bb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/gtaLJgVH95OgCa32vyVUpL2HgcZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
