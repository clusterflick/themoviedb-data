He came out later in life, so he missed out on the experience of being young and queer, along with all the love and lust that comes with it. When he finally works up the courage to make up for lost time, he is rejected and condemned. At his most desperate, Dante hears laughter echoing within a gay nightclub glory-hole. As he nears the fluid-drenched stall door, he quickly finds himself transported to the lair of a demon, who is ready to offer him eternal youth and beauty. Although Dante seeks more than just sex, he nervously accepts this unrefusable offer. It doesn't take long for the demon to reveal the strings attached-to keep his new body, he must kill his hookups every full moon, \"when the gays are their most feral.\" It turns out Dante is pretty good at being a killer, that is until he falls in love with one of his victims.","popularity":0.2303,"poster_path":"/aA944VXxtMOBhalrtzC4leqvzkg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demon Twink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1954921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Tysor","original_name":"Jonathan Tysor","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/90MkQDPc7XQA87ibVnO0WChMbkC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67faf8c2de5e4dec62ade601","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1869176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Caceres","original_name":"Jason Caceres","popularity":0.2363,"profile_path":"/3Kz4hLNg99WnPnXp3SoBujRgVFU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67faf8ccaacf7cfb269922f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4747570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Stanley","original_name":"Chris Stanley","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/ku9ZJR2B9D4NbxeijiTnCXvTW36.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67faf8fade5e4dec62ade613","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitchell Hawes","original_name":"Mitchell Hawes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67faf90ac74c16bf88ad08b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Warfield","original_name":"Maurice Warfield","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67faf9131f3bcfea48d95fda","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simone Tringali","original_name":"Simone Tringali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67faf92cde5e4dec62ade624","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben L.
