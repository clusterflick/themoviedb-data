And why is there still so much resistance to that?  Through interviews with funded artists, cultural managers, policymakers, and spontaneous conversations with local residents, the film reveals a reality that goes beyond the borders of a single town, drawing a wider picture of the relationship between art, public policy, and everyday life.  The documentary features historian Célio Turino, creator of the Pontos de Cultura program, and congresswoman Jandira Feghali, rapporteur of the Aldir Blanc Law. The screenplay is co-written by Turino and director bagadefente.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":"/hAg6KUK37wkPXM7l49K0ZnApoqf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220026,"logo_path":null,"name":"NADA∴Studio Criativo","origin_country":""},{"id":259313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phalangae Produções","origin_country":""},{"id":259314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olhares Produtora","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A glimpse into how public cultural policies shape everyday life.","title":"We Want More Than Money","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"We Want More Than Money","type":"International title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2781863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jandira Feghali","original_name":"Jandira Feghali","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fbd3fc3110bd82dfacfdf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369829,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Célio Turino","original_name":"Célio Turino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fbd40b765c5222f39925fb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3356698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"bagadefente","original_name":"Baga Defente","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rOmGNW4mUF4eOQamb28Nkho7uAM.jpg","credit_id":"67fbd20bde5e4dec62ae01db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3356698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"bagadefente","original_name":"Baga Defente","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rOmGNW4mUF4eOQamb28Nkho7uAM.jpg","credit_id":"67fbd220de5e4dec62ae01de","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369827,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathan Lisboa","original_name":"Nathan Lisboa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbd231765c5222f3992579","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369828,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eduardo Baroni","original_name":"Eduardo Baroni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbd2433110bd82dfacfd6c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369829,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Célio Turino","original_name":"Célio Turino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbd25c1ce4a3fb1cd92c55","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3356698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"bagadefente","original_name":"Baga Defente","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rOmGNW4mUF4eOQamb28Nkho7uAM.jpg","credit_id":"67fbd26c3110bd82dfacfd91","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369827,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathan Lisboa","original_name":"Nathan Lisboa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbd276a04f530b5c998e49","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3356698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"bagadefente","original_name":"Baga Defente","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rOmGNW4mUF4eOQamb28Nkho7uAM.jpg","credit_id":"67fbd429c74c16bf88ad2b6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1E1qsSCpCr7k5dMtfMuZhAZQifw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/hAg6KUK37wkPXM7l49K0ZnApoqf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3675,"name":"arts and culture"},{"id":233421,"name":"brazilian politics"},{"id":338238,"name":"public funding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A gente não quer só dinheiro (2025) —Trailer de curta-metragem","key":"vNFC3H_sjuY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-11T12:47:54.000Z","id":"67fbd1e2d3ab7d7a8bae1e83"}]}}}
