At 9 years old he’s smaller than most of his tough-guy friends and submits both to their teasing and to his uneasy role as the pet of the orphanage’s matron. Dreaming of a home with real parents, his only protector is Clara, a sullen older girl. As the summer wears on, Olejka becomes the center of a desperate tangle of abuse.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":"/9swDB7x5hIdCiRJk0hrz62IQkAF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Place Far From Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matvey Kazazayev","original_name":"Matvey Kazazayev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67fa56b1c74c16bf88acf59a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Sanzhayeva","original_name":"Diana Sanzhayeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67fa56b7ea80d8517599f80b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Mashanova","original_name":"Diana Mashanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa56781f3bcfea48d92773","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Mashanova","original_name":"Diana Mashanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa567eea80d8517599f7e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Mashanova","original_name":"Diana Mashanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa5683ea80d8517599f7ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4337103,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grigory Maykov","original_name":"Grigory Maykov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa568ca04f530b5c994e5f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367197,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Polina Berestovaia","original_name":"Polina Berestovaia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa569fc74c16bf88acf583","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w4SgfGqkKbk6eFg4eEhfcvFdl8p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2517}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9swDB7x5hIdCiRJk0hrz62IQkAF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Atlanta Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
