They call themselves a \"brotherhood\", and it's true. These guys do not just skate on boards and create clothes, they have developed a unique, peculiar style, which has now grown into something big, which can be called a subculture. They are different from other brands, because they do not adjust to anyone, they show their lifestyle, not shying away from any symbols, gestures and phrases. Some people recognize it and some people hate it. A huge number of tattoos on the body, their own design of clothes, their own fashion - all this is the image of \"Podmost\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2onXT9QUtLc5uQIzTYcVhrNitHT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Podmost: Emotionally Unavailable","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Подмост: Емоційно Недоступні","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Mironjuk","original_name":"Nikita Mironjuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67fa962fde5e4dec62adc64e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Mironjuk","original_name":"Nikita Mironjuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa96521f3bcfea48d94732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Au9B2wM6GgaXwEmV1j0zFTcnuaY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2onXT9QUtLc5uQIzTYcVhrNitHT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2015-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Подмост: Эмоционально Недоступны\"","key":"AO5uU-48mMg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-07T20:26:24.000Z","id":"67fa95acd3ab7d7a8bade59a"}]}}}
