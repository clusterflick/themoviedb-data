What started out as a casual trip turned into a serious fascination with the culture and its music for two of the band members, Hyun-bo and Hye-ri. A year later, in August 2007, they formed a five-member Irish trend project band ‘Bard’ and went to the World Fleadh in Portlaoise, Ireland, each with only their instruments. Music in Ireland is deeply connected to daily life and reflects the country’s painful history.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bIpZz7lkUpbX5mB7WBOm5mySFub.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2008-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two-eyed Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Jin-pyung","original_name":"Lim Jin-pyung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67faa0a0d3ab7d7a8bade94b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":2286,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/bIpZz7lkUpbX5mB7WBOm5mySFub.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1597}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Michuhol, Incheon","release_date":"2007-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
