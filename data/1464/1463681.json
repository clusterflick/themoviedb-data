As Ellen watches, she unravels a chilling mystery: the legends Roberta investigated—haunted tunnels, forgotten cryptids, and ghostly figures—weren’t just stories. With each tape, Ellen pieces together her sister’s disappearance, discovering something sinister was watching Roberta all along.  As the past seeps into the present, Ellen must decide how far she will go to bring her sister back—before she vanishes.  Partly shot through the raw lens of VHS footage and set against the haunting backdrop of the early '90s Deep South, Southern Scares isn’t just another horror story—it’s a puzzle, a mystery, and a warning.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"Are you ready for a Southern Scare?","title":"Southern Scares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"River Rose","original_name":"River Rose","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ghost Child","credit_id":"67fb547ac74c16bf88ad1996","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4962609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aston Regan","original_name":"Aston Regan","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/gI2MHnrY21Q8g4fnZEVC2O35Kt2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ghost Child","credit_id":"67fb54827b43bdce20aef3a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4962571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Rowe","original_name":"Paul Rowe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vl6BUINdFBzRyETEoriXba5azk9.jpg","credit_id":"67fb54d4d3ab7d7a8bae04e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4962571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Rowe","original_name":"Paul Rowe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vl6BUINdFBzRyETEoriXba5azk9.jpg","credit_id":"67fb54df1bc639566adadef7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36113721","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
