Their brand-new, hard-earned car seems to have a life of its own. What they initially thought was a mechanical malfunction soon reveals itself to be something much more sinister: the vehicle is under a curse. With every unexpected turn and uncontrolled acceleration, their lives are engulfed in a wave of confusion and terror.  The spell behind the car stems from the revenge of a woman with a past intertwined with Humberto's. As the vehicle inexplicably changes owners, new drivers are drawn into this madcap chase. The influence of the haunted car unleashes a chain of entanglements and unusual problems that seem unresolved.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":93259,"logo_path":"/rMYiGrEDx7GdOcfv91pVRYovmWA.png","name":"RCTV","origin_country":"VE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1991-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El carro embrujado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Orjuela","original_name":"Esther Orjuela","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67fb065fc74c16bf88ad0c28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3649971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reina Hinojosa","original_name":"Reina Hinojosa","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67fb0672ea80d851759a11b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Machuca","original_name":"Antonio Machuca","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67fb0682ea80d851759a11bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1464643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicente Tepedino","original_name":"Vicente Tepedino","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/7VdhKppqYsTMGyZGQq5hGugy0xm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67fb06cbc74c16bf88ad0c60","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Rodríguez","original_name":"Irina Rodríguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67fb06dcea80d851759a1208","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
