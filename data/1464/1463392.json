Now an artist's portfolio is seen, it opens up and different parts of a sketch which are enclosed therein, mysteriously fly from it upon the canvas until finally all the parts resemble the image of a man. When completed, the picture becomes animated and comes down upon the ground and engages in some merry antics with its own skeleton which shortly after is changed into a lady. After frolicking around for an interval, the man is changed to a sketch on the canvas; then it begins to dismember itself, one portion at the time. After all the parts of the sketch are in the portfolio, it folds itself up; then the animated person appears from some mysterious source and carries off the portfolio in which his own image is enclosed.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lost Film","title":"A Mischievous Sketch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"67fa8cd8ea80d8517599fede","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
