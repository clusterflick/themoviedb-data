Eavesdropping on their private moments, she compiles a library of fights, family meetings, confessions and hookups - an array of emotions to taste-test, rewind and revisit as she likes. When she encounters Martin, a self-secluded man who harbors violent fantasies, Rebecca creeps down from her voyeuristic listening post. Helpless to resist, she engages with him in a visceral but contactless transaction - as grave as life and death but just within earshot.","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":"/6PVDoNtPCDfi54218QBteObg1xx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Interaction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suziey Block","original_name":"Suziey Block","popularity":0.2274,"profile_path":"/a6hmTvyW2NubdPPQRSQL3dYCK3V.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67fa53921bc639566ada9b4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benno Ressa","original_name":"Benno Ressa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67fa539a1bc639566ada9b57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Lind","original_name":"Morgan Lind","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67fa53d41bc639566ada9b77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5367173,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"R.J.
