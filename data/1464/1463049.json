Racing on closed public roads at speeds in excess of 200 mph, the riders dice with danger and even death.  To outsiders, it looks like a form of madness. To those who do it, it’s like their religion, and the road their church. But with the ever-present risk of life-changing injuries or fatalities, in recent years the future of the sport has hung in the balance.  Following three riders in the weeks leading up to the North West 200, this film explores how faith, family and the risk of fatality push a diverse cast of racers to the limit.","popularity":0.2674,"poster_path":"/dWW5GiejemE7EQSwaqcAJKQPFjT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25055,"logo_path":"/eyNIfbCskdzFRfHIDdzgOmRMjbW.png","name":"DoubleBand Films","origin_country":"XI"},{"id":7710,"logo_path":"/iJQIjE9g4FqCDPLzxqoOfQ0e4Xx.png","name":"BBC One","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ride or Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983369,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben O'Loan","original_name":"Ben O'Loan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9a16cea80d8517599cdb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944937,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sharon Whittaker","original_name":"Sharon Whittaker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9a17ef81b02b080991da7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dWW5GiejemE7EQSwaqcAJKQPFjT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184237,"name":"road racing"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":344318,"name":"motorcycle documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
