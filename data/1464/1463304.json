Paradoxically, this refusal led to a revolutionary advance in the field of medicine. Their professor suggests that they take camel's blood out of the freezer, in which they accidentally discover some strange little antibodies they've never seen before. The faculty scientists take their study a step further and realize that these ultra-resistant molecules, which look like heat-seeking missiles, have astonishing properties, including the ability to sneak into places where others don't go.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2CeGrh02VZ6PG3a2rIsBNmQnivX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un remède de chameau - La révolution des nanocorps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Heilung durch Kamele? - Die Revolution der Nanopartikel","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Heilung durch Kamele?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Rousset","original_name":"Johanna Rousset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67fa51ec1bc639566ada9aaa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1132115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Jampolsky","original_name":"Marc Jampolsky","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fa51c8ea80d8517599f68d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30750845","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9NpNlnzFUkmYrSaRGKb39jEDCce.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8GvQq2Twn17m0bU8GPR96sX5dLr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2CeGrh02VZ6PG3a2rIsBNmQnivX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2023-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
