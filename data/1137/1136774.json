Some of the footage is consensual, some is \"stolen\" and some is footage taken over a lifetime, seemingly with no other purpose than to look at me: who am I? By putting all this material together, the personal-intimate becomes narrative: my recent break-up, my parents' break-up, my inadequacy as a mother. The result is a kind of intimate diary that, in becoming public, is perhaps obscene. But where are the boundaries between what should remain private and what can be shared? Even more so today?","popularity":0.044,"poster_path":"/d04Ov705JrMMqkwvax1mqltY7rR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dok Mobile","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":201660,"logo_path":null,"name":"A little Confidence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"where are the boundaries of privacy?","title":"Chutzpah - qualcosa sul pudore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Stambrini","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/cqG4DVVlWcTCg95ETIIRnT4ssDT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monica","credit_id":"64802b77e272600107200f24","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31013,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paola Freddi","original_name":"Paola Freddi","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64802bef99259c00acca7e07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Stambrini","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/cqG4DVVlWcTCg95ETIIRnT4ssDT.jpg","credit_id":"64802b88bf31f2013adc40f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Stambrini","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/cqG4DVVlWcTCg95ETIIRnT4ssDT.jpg","credit_id":"64802bd3d2b20900ad3a3acf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Stambrini","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/cqG4DVVlWcTCg95ETIIRnT4ssDT.jpg","credit_id":"64802be0e375c00139be06a6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Stambrini","original_name":"Monica Stambrini","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/cqG4DVVlWcTCg95ETIIRnT4ssDT.jpg","credit_id":"64802bc699259c00ff0c4513","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":779,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A672CRukJEc7sE6rFUUQlqZQsVi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1384}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d04Ov705JrMMqkwvax1mqltY7rR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
