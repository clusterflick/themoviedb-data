Alcohol and a doctor's injection of morphine were the immediate causes. Ever since his childhood in Wales his life was a spectacular attempt - comic at times, serious below the surface, tragic at the finish - to survive on his own bizarre terms as the poet to end all poets. By the 1950s, that first postwar decade of uneasiness and change, Dylan Thomas was a legend to his admirers but a burnt-out case to himself. As he tours America to read poetry to rapt audiences, his past crowds in on him, the fractured memories of a man at the end of his tether.","popularity":0.8142,"poster_path":"/pyamF3EzRfi6gWQnTy2RRasO6t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/cey5EAFwOb7AfDOsQ4p4q5MixzX.png","name":"BBC Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dylan: The Life and Death of a Poet","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Lacey","original_name":"Ronald Lacey","popularity":0.6943,"profile_path":"/wrFU5EkxKIq0TpEBuKXzcRAld73.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dylan","credit_id":"647cc8de93828e00bf9efc86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gayle Hunnicutt","original_name":"Gayle Hunnicutt","popularity":0.3108,"profile_path":"/sazCNflLrqm7zYbFvfR2SKDvUST.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Liz","credit_id":"647cc8facaef2d00aa4324c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Bishop","original_name":"Ed Bishop","popularity":0.4564,"profile_path":"/uLLoKf4BknxuF1SOSD0EBB4gSmc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Prof. Goonmeyer","credit_id":"647cc919e323f3010615b6aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1497048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Harper","original_name":"Kate Harper","popularity":0.3925,"profile_path":"/uN0CA2CsywCU3ZUbZBEOCwqS8lQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Connie Goonmeyer","credit_id":"647cc92ee323f300a7d63acf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1653085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Colgan","original_name":"Valerie Colgan","popularity":0.2708,"profile_path":"/qVrWdI8cpkAnB7j8t6t4Th6I64Y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Imogen McLewis","credit_id":"647cc9490e29a200dcbb8475","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Chancer","original_name":"Norman Chancer","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/xxj8VqbDm4chXUF4A7Z3BnEpOVB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Prof. McLewis","credit_id":"647cc95d0e29a20116ad6397","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":186029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Ryan","original_name":"Hilary Ryan","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Girl student","credit_id":"647cc97a93828e0116251192","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhoda Lewis","original_name":"Rhoda Lewis","popularity":0.1437,"profile_path":"/xEXoBUqI9aoi2lcjTENXe07XbRE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Florence Thomas","credit_id":"647cc98c0e29a20116ad63ae","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifford Evans","original_name":"Clifford Evans","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/oAVJM8VENRtNJ65wHB7JsxxKWTV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"D.J.
