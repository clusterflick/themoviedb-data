This short was made for Chuck Jones children's series THE CURIOSITY SHOP and later fell into the 16mm market. By that time, everyone from Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass to Jim Henson, said that they were influenced and inspired by George Pal's Puppetoons. After making a series of great films that turned out to be box-office flops, such as ATLANTIS THE LOST CONTINENT (1961), THE 7 FACES OF DR. LAO (1964), and THE POWER (1968), all of which had stop-motion scenes, perhaps it was time to go back to his roots. Directed by Gene Warren and animated by Harry Walton.","popularity":0.1857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tool Box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041066,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gene Warren","original_name":"Gene Warren","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647e39bf0e29a22bdfecaaa1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29747,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Huneck","original_name":"John Huneck","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc1b4d8aa734b376a69050","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Emenegger","original_name":"Robert Emenegger","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc1b639b1f9121abd651f6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimmie Haskell","original_name":"Jimmie Haskell","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc1b6f6ec7804796d650c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454033,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Harry Walton","original_name":"Harry Walton","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc1b7ef17b887599d645c9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimmie Haskell","original_name":"Jimmie Haskell","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc1ba19b1f9121abd651fe","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5130340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
