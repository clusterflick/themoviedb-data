Viewers will get an unvarnished, inside look at the people, places and powerful social forces currently at work preventing ambitious climate action â€” as well as the cacophony of mutinous, beautifully dangerous, and hope-driving faces of those who would put an end to the fossil fuel age, before it puts an end to all of us and all of our animal brothers and sisters, on whom we rely for so much and who now need us to succeed more than ever before.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Edmund Pettus Bridge to Climate Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4097276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Widick","original_name":"Richard Widick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647cf9b60e29a20116ad704a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
