The plot of the film focuses on two gangs of young men fighting over a church that has been transformed into a shelter. The protagonist, a member of one of the gangs, tries to navigate between the desire to survive and his humanity. He seeks to protect the one he loves, he does not want to betray his friends, and therefore he does not withdraw from the fight. When the gangs clash in a brutal battle, the wounded hero is rescued by his beloved at the risk of his own life. The hero's friends win the battle, but instead of joyful bells, the thunder of fighter jets rings out, blending in with the brushstrokes of the unfinished painting. The lovers fail to protect each other from their inevitable fate.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/aPdIkxrv8XmFSNXj5Zv3iG9wUtX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158003,"logo_path":"/58rlz0a17BkLfJKDPEvngC3O4DB.png","name":"Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kircheninneres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3340809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petras Šimonis","original_name":"Petras Šimonis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"647d08430fb398013559c014","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulina Taujanskaitė","original_name":"Paulina Taujanskaitė","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"647d084b0e29a200bf1f8dd4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aidas Jurgaitis","original_name":"Aidas Jurgaitis","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"647d085493828e013378594f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lukas Malinauskas","original_name":"Lukas Malinauskas","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/pOlYq8gqH3vOY3asCWDuuQC1sKc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"647d085b174973011871a897","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karolis Vilkas","original_name":"Karolis Vilkas","popularity":0.0415,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"647d086117497300de670418","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","original_name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d086e93828e00dcdd6d65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","original_name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d08750fb39801180e06cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","original_name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d087d93828e0133785959","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","original_name":"Mindaugas Docaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d0886e323f30148174a6d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256961,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Ūsaitė","original_name":"Laura Ūsaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d08920fb39800fb0c2bba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irena Kuneviciute","original_name":"Irena Kuneviciute","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d089be323f300c42a9d5c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mindaugas Šmėga","original_name":"Mindaugas Šmėga","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d08a90fb39800a79f384b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mindaugas Šmėga","original_name":"Mindaugas Šmėga","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647d08af0fb39800fb0c2bca","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27942482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aPdIkxrv8XmFSNXj5Zv3iG9wUtX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
