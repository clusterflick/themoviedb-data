More than 70 women, from all over Greece, tell how they were forced, at a tender age, to mature violently in one night and face war, hunger, occupation, resistance and liberation, with bravery, composure and resourcefulness . Some energetic, some shy, some still emotionally charged, these women remember how their fear turned into strength and the play of carefree childhood became a responsibility and an adult role. Their testimonies are small mosaics that make up the palimpsest of the micro-history of Greece. A story experienced through multiple lives.. Their memories are precious not only because they are the last survivors of a martyred historical period, but because they co-shaped, with missing emotions and a spiritually plundered world, a new life.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/pR5R0GGrjvOe1GRc8xJzdBpy8lZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":182679,"logo_path":null,"name":"ΕΡΤ3","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2022-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Memories Stoned Inside her","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tania Hatzigeorgiou","original_name":"Tania Hatzigeorgiou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647e1f74ccde0400fbcea05a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tania Hatzigeorgiou","original_name":"Tania Hatzigeorgiou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647e1f810e29a22bdfeca1ec","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4173291,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iliana Skouli","original_name":"Iliana Skouli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babe994d23dd00e7ce2d96","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173292,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yorgos Kazantzis","original_name":"Yorgos Kazantzis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babece6aa8e0010ec8f79f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tania Hatzigeorgiou","original_name":"Tania Hatzigeorgiou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babee911386c012df3337d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4173291,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iliana Skouli","original_name":"Iliana Skouli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babefc43501100e4c8a735","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173293,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Themis Mauroperastis","original_name":"Themis Mauroperastis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babf20ab6849011c078be0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dimitris Frastanlis","original_name":"Dimitris Frastanlis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babf5a3009aa0139688709","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3758564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eleni Chrysomalli","original_name":"Eleni Chrysomalli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64babf76ab6849011c078c04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pR5R0GGrjvOe1GRc8xJzdBpy8lZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo8HKgzVtuM&ab_channel=%CE%95%CE%A1%CE%A4%CE%91.%CE%95.","release_date":"2022-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ντοκιμαντέρ γυναίκες \"Οι μνήμες πέτρωσαν μέσα της\" | 28/10/2021 | ΕΡΤ","key":"oJTDrJ2w3dc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-28T11:53:03.000Z","id":"647e1f5bcf4b8b01227739f1"}]}}}
