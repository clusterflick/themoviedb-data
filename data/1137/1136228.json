Each fled persecution in Iran, searching for safety, freedom and a brighter future, only to be treated callously by the Australia government. Forming a close friendship while detained, they used music and art as a form of peaceful resistance to promote humanity and tirelessly advocate on behalf of all those who remained held. Australian artist Angus McDonald’s passionate documentary, whilst not shying away from the brutality of their experience, embraces their extraordinary resilience and optimism.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/sG7xJ2XdKHbp7Zju5pu093eyd27.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Howling Eagle Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most powerful act of resistance is love.","title":"Freedom Is Beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angus McDonald","original_name":"Angus McDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f51c1c77d23b00ec05f680","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28668521","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"freedomisbeautiful.film","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i0Pul6lWCSLSWPSHD2gV6q5oUOV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kYhm6xdcdLdA31HCGc0lDuAe8Jx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYMUTB71K4Xg2LpRwgWY2ZDNtuD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.173,"height":313,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vumWIdU5FdhQC0Em10EptOjYtB7.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1619}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sG7xJ2XdKHbp7Zju5pu093eyd27.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bnHwTVys7cSTA2DUnCccm9oXHF2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pciIPFFZjp9pftMB5fG7Er8cTeH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/raYgPQbWG9mQdZ6M96ZOYE2Ug4G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Byron Bay International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"1pbyjqyyWow","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-06-04T00:00:01.000Z","id":"647d4d0517497300de672abe"}]}}}
