In Apulia, a region in south-eastern Italy, the most serious botanical pandemic of the century is underway: a quarantine bacterium, Xylella Fastidiosa, is killing millions of olive trees.  Disrupting landscape, economy and human relations.  The Era of Giants narrates Giuseppe’s journey to his father’s land, in the Plain of the Monumental Olive Trees, where the epidemic is imminent.
