He was a multi-instrumentalist and prolific composer.  Just for Gordon is a documentary about his life and the tunes he wrote that have quickly become a mainstay of the Scottish traditional music repertoire. His tunes had true significance, not just in their unique and original arrangement, but also in their very inspiration - often from entertaining occurrences in Gordon's life. His tunes can be heard at T in the Park, Celtic Connections, Celtic Colours in Canada, the Lorient festival in Brittany and the Fleadh Che√≤il in Ireland.  Gordon Duncan helped to put piping on the map for a whole new generation and for his pupils.  The programme features the musicians that knew and played with him and those who continue to play and be inspired by his music, especially his own pupils.","popularity":0.4056,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193351,"logo_path":"/m7WvlyIAnDSdjjR8u5etsrb1w4y.png","name":"BBC Alba","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just for Gordon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Murray","original_name":"Anna Murray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"647f0e000fb39801180f0902","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Duncan","original_name":"Gordon Duncan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647f11aa0fb39800fb0d347d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099432,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andy Halley","original_name":"Andy Halley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f0f0093828e00f9d90218","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099433,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gavin Humphreys","original_name":"Gavin Humphreys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f0f39174973011872b2dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Angela Mackay","original_name":"Angela Mackay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f0e5fcaef2d00aa442b54","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017532,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gregor Tulloch","original_name":"Gregor Tulloch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f0f1293828e00a7660a65","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099435,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carol Nic Thomais","original_name":"Carol Nic Thomais","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f0f8ecf4b8b00c3d3c7af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Cheape","original_name":"Annie Cheape","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f109c0e29a22be293d99c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":188645,"name":"bagpipe"},{"id":210543,"name":"traditional music"},{"id":276930,"name":"perth, scotland"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
