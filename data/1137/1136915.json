An essay for the children who never left the Residential Schools, told via the colonial plunder in Barcelona and the civil war that followed, alongside Wilkerson's personal family heirlooms, brought from Europe to the former Mexican territory of California, one hundred years ago.

And if left unchecked, it has the potential to destroy us all.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/nE1meMmQcC9FihITzN8yKcp9h83.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Second Burial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"El segundo entierro","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1613560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Wilkerson","original_name":"Erin Wilkerson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647f6a5bca7ec600adb55a9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wpAzBt6gAsN6lfeoph3y0jkFYGi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nE1meMmQcC9FihITzN8yKcp9h83.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine UNAM","release_date":"2023-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
