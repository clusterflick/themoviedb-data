While reading his favorite Mickey Spillane book, he falls asleep and dreams of a helpless girl in dire need of a hero. In his dream, he becomes the mighty John Baretta who looks danger in the eye and laughs. When he wakes, he finds a note in his book that says, \"Remember me. They're gonna die. See me. Help me.\" Johnny sets out on a quest to find the dire maiden in his dream and save her from a criminal's grip. The story juxtaposes Johnny's actual blunder of an adventure with what he envisions in his mind to be this great caper that will prove he can be the stoic hero of the books he reads. Let's just hope Johnny can live up to the hype of his own mental status.","popularity":0.179,"poster_path":"/rkR9aEJH0YGKq2UoNpIj5HQEOOE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oculus Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-30","revenue":9,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young man finds himself inside a crime fiction novel without the fiction.","title":"Let Sleeping Guns Lie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4096914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Elson","original_name":"Kelly Elson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Johnny Barrett","credit_id":"647cb720cf4b8b00a8781f69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4096915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caleb Pass","original_name":"Caleb Pass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mac Sharp","credit_id":"647cb73417497300a819f2b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4096916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.J.
