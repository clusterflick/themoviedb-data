Undoubtedly one of the most striking Quebec experimental films of the 1970s. This work with its expressionist aesthetic has been aptly described as Kafkaesque, the adjective emphasizing the ability of the two filmmakers to evoke anguish and madness, the feeling of confinement and withdrawal into oneself. Important detail: the screenplay written by the character is called The Basement, which is also the title of another Cholakian film made in 1974.
