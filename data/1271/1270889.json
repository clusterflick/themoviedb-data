Ten years after the murder, relatives of Maria and Zé Claudio and witnesses to the case continued to suffer threats to their lives and intimidation to leave the settlement where they live. Nonetheless, the relatives of Maria and Zé Claudio remained on the land, turning the couple's residence into a kind of museum-foundation bearing their names, and continued to mobilize the fight for justice, against violence in the countryside, and in defense of the living forest, where the gigantic Brazil nut tree named Majesty, a symbol of the living presence of Maria and Zé Claudio, resides.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6pEzS14bAMdFqxp6dUsgSBTrM5V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Segue viva a luta pela floresta viva!","title":"Maria e Zé Claudio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4638754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evandro Medeiros","original_name":"Evandro Medeiros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66121bbe1f3319017dc2a853","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4638756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabio Oliveira","original_name":"Fabio Oliveira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66121bedc68b69016304537d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zmoMFgBdMQLXtQ4ABgJHXR5BzM1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6pEzS14bAMdFqxp6dUsgSBTrM5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
