As told by a narrator, Johnson is a horse who is the object of the ceaseless praise and unknowable desire of a dreamy silent performer. The movie is a collaged poetic narrative constructed of vintage video technology, miniature tableaux, eerie dreamscapes and pantomimic gestures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Barten","original_name":"Rebecca Barten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661069de1108a801648bb58b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
