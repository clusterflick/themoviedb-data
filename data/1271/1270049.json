The film translates personal grief into a contemplation of the human condition, establishing a dialogue between the personal and the universal. It acknowledges individual grief while resonating with the shared human experience. Beneath its overarching imagery is a quiet recognition of countless refugees and migrants whose journeys for safer lives ceased amidst the sea's relentless expanse. Their tales are subtly etched in the ceaseless motion of the waves, forming an undercurrent to the film's acknowledgment of lives lost in the pursuit of hope","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea of Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hüseyin Mert Erverdi","original_name":"Hüseyin Mert Erverdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661029202d531a017d7ed2a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
