This film adds a new dimension to a text which asks many questions: What is the real nature of power? Where does it actually reside? How do we respond to, and understand, powerlessness? Why is protest utterly inadequate? What happens when people read philosophy out loud to each other? Inspired by Godard, people read the essay \"What Is Power?\" out loud to the film viewer as if across the table at one of Fred Dewey's table readings of Hannah Arendt's works.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reading Aloud: What Is Power? by Fred Dewey (short version)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Berman Duff","original_name":"Dana Berman Duff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661076eedf86a8013252b01f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
