Vio.Me. formed a cooperative in order to operate legally. However, Vio.Me. does not operate as a traditional cooperative. The workers do not consider the company their property but a common good that should serve the community. In the film the Vio.Me. worker Makis Anagnostou states that: “Our proposal is addressed to the whole of society, because we, as the working class, have proven that we can self-manage a factory, that we can do it ourselves, but our proposal that reaches out to society is that we can all self-manage our lives. This is why it concerns the whole of society. The factory is not a closed space, nor are we the vanguard of the working class.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/iGsBPwfhzhbdjozUhaK4M1RtAta.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Occupy, Resist, Produce – Vio.Me.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dario Azzellini","original_name":"Dario Azzellini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zlZgeSpfwPHHFDssj0chSjMT5TP.jpg","credit_id":"6611ed4e356a71014a2334f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dario Azzellini","original_name":"Dario Azzellini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zlZgeSpfwPHHFDssj0chSjMT5TP.jpg","credit_id":"6611ed65df86a8017e53eab0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Ressler","original_name":"Oliver Ressler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8s9eErrGWAQT0u9LF38RNvof5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"6611eda5356a71016423bd19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Ressler","original_name":"Oliver Ressler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8s9eErrGWAQT0u9LF38RNvof5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"6611edf4b33903017b6f4613","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4638436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thanasis Apostolidis","original_name":"Thanasis Apostolidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611ee39356a71016423be2a","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Ressler","original_name":"Oliver Ressler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8s9eErrGWAQT0u9LF38RNvof5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"6611ede36f43ec017dc207e7","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2876032,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rudolf Gottsberger","original_name":"Rudolf Gottsberger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611ee4a356a71016423be48","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2876032,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rudolf Gottsberger","original_name":"Rudolf Gottsberger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611ee5767dcc9017c9c9f81","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dario Azzellini","original_name":"Dario Azzellini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zlZgeSpfwPHHFDssj0chSjMT5TP.jpg","credit_id":"6611ed8b6f43ec0163c17141","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2876032,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rudolf Gottsberger","original_name":"Rudolf Gottsberger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611ee18356a71016423bdcf","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Ressler","original_name":"Oliver Ressler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8s9eErrGWAQT0u9LF38RNvof5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"6611edafb3390301486e0ba9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iGsBPwfhzhbdjozUhaK4M1RtAta.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Occupy, Resist, Produce – Vio.Me.
