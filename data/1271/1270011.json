The film opens with the sonic resonance of the church bell portrayed later as a towering monument, pointing to Christian ideals that served as both a precursor to the Enlightenment and bedfellow in maintaining this hierarchical order.  Weaving together multiple historical epics with political and mythical narratives, the work uses ideas of spectacle and scandal to address the continued dispossession of “Europe’s Others,” as Lewis describes them.
