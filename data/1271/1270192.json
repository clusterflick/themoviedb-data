A road movie where each of them searches for her roots and self-identity in multinational Kazakhstan and beyond. Along the way, grandmother, daughter, and granddaughter visit the house that no longer belongs to them in Kazan, Tatarstan. All three of them were born in that country, but it’s no longer sovereign. Together they find the grave of the man who brings the three of them together. It’s an intimate story, but it’s also a story about all of us.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/dALeLpIzxdJXwIHOyxkoPRv4Ope.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uvent Production","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2024-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gingerbread for Her Dad","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","title":"Gingerbread for her dad","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alissa Mustafina","original_name":"Alissa Mustafina","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66b2e6feb0ff9c9eff7b8cc1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyabiba Sermukhamedova","original_name":"Lyabiba Sermukhamedova","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66b2e709f7af098c5d92d7ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4636502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Mustafina","original_name":"Alina Mustafina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66b2e7196678380f80a1128b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4636502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Mustafina","original_name":"Alina Mustafina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2e7307df273196527ce41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4636502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Mustafina","original_name":"Alina Mustafina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2e739f7a06306d86f695b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2882357,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erkezhan Maksut","original_name":"Erkezhan Maksut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2e7489cf97b292292db0e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Akzhol Bi-Sarsenbayev","original_name":"Akzhol Bi-Sarsenbayev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2e75b7df273196527ce52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2199207,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexey Elagin","original_name":"Alexey Elagin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2e775c6f1e6094ef13e21","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Akmaral Mergen","original_name":"Akmaral Mergen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2e79a6ad8dd818ca86e38","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31830345","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uKhfRm5muTHOtmgn2dDkWwsBdDi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dALeLpIzxdJXwIHOyxkoPRv4Ope.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"kk","file_path":"/bJNXZFcytrjH1wHP167dfbyJBdn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zlvRdqqNBQ8DGnzK6Yv00MFux8H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Torino Film Festival ","release_date":"2024-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
