As the construction progresses, Manole faces various challenges and obstacles, as well as the pressure to create a durable and beautiful building. As the work progresses, Manole finds himself in the midst of a dilemma: in order to reinforce the construction, he is forced to sacrifice something very dear to him. This act of sacrifice is central to the story and raises profound themes such as art, devotion, and the human limits of sacrifice.","popularity":0.1486,"poster_path":"/lfgb3uz0wXYQf91ASPidi64WFr4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46474,"logo_path":null,"name":"TVR","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1993-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
