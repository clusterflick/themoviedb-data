Will he fight against nature's forces, or submit to its power? Jimmy John Thaiday discusses how his culture, living on Erub directly informs the themes of the film: The ocean is always changing, shifting, and moving. I am exploring the way the ocean creates cycles of life, death, and rebirth. Important moments in our lives push and pull us like the water. If we resist these forces, life can be tough, and we can suffer. When we let go, and accept that life is like nature; it is constantly changing both for good and bad. If we understand this, then we can let nature take its course, and things will be in balance.","popularity":0.0542,"poster_path":"/vc12tM4Qp2AVa594ocSBGh7Pilc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Beneath The Surface","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jimmy John Thaiday","original_name":"Jimmy John Thaiday","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6659dfde2c7537f5811d4575","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4635916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jimmy John Thaiday","original_name":"Jimmy John Thaiday","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66101836e78e2d0163224509","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Keiron","original_name":"James Keiron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659dff2d263ea30a4d97f92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vc12tM4Qp2AVa594ocSBGh7Pilc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
