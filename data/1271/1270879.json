When she grew older, she made the difficult decision to cut off all contact with her parents. The Final Chapter chronicles Frøydis’s experience after she learns that her father, to whom she has not spoken in years, is dying. Deeply conflicted at the prospect of reconnecting with him, she explores her feelings with her oldest friend and her partner. In these candid exchanges, she describes the sanctuary she found in staying with her friend’s family when she was young, how much the safety and connection meant to her. The warmth of these exchanges starkly contrasts with her fears about revisiting a relationship that is both painful and central to her life. Stunning cinematography and visual metaphors resonate with Frøydis’s poignant words as she approaches this momentous decision with beauty and restraint.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/hteHFteWSY5b3sZsvf4ET6O7sGp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Final Chapter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frøydis Fossli Moe","original_name":"Frøydis Fossli Moe","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/zFiosLKrRTsPKhENvRm5nOp9Pwc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66120d88d768fe017b43212b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frøydis Fossli Moe","original_name":"Frøydis Fossli Moe","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/zFiosLKrRTsPKhENvRm5nOp9Pwc.jpg","credit_id":"66120d99356a71014a23454f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281266,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristi Strømmen Kjerpeset","original_name":"Kristi Strømmen Kjerpeset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66120dad67dcc9017c9ce313","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3686023,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Brage Bergh","original_name":"Brage Bergh","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iwQIdM2Ri8g4aTtkcd20IOCrF5F.jpg","credit_id":"66120dbf6f43ec0163c18e9a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3672824,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mikkel Strøm","original_name":"Mikkel Strøm","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zAXEwS8spcD66UIWYIf0Xa1xbvh.jpg","credit_id":"66120dd81108a8017d8dcd7a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vdGmQoPHPw7oKy35u0EJTJcTLbB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/hteHFteWSY5b3sZsvf4ET6O7sGp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Full Frame Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
