The film documents the creative process of actors preparing a play about the re-encounter of a girl who has attempted suicide with her friends from a theatre group. The idea is to give a voice to the young people, those who have attempted, the friends and relatives of those who survive and those who die. The documentary proposes a recovery of self-esteem and hope for those who consider suicide, encouraging all to give a new meaning to their existence, indicating the possibility of new choices and pathways.","popularity":0.0548,"poster_path":"/ayLxrpPBx37lP0bmvwb2tTg43Dg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80352,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPC Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":225424,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICEM - Instituto Cultura em Movimento","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2024-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Alarm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3371020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letícia Pinheiro","original_name":"Letícia Pinheiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fca09467b2a16466d05770","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4115210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrique Bulhões","original_name":"Henrique Bulhões","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/rxEr3qBHVntcSniXJO6QclmVfMD.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fca0a3df2aba95b3f22c17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4975039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marília Magalhães","original_name":"Marília Magalhães","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fca0bbe26a53c122594415","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4374445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Marquez","original_name":"Pedro Marquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fca0c46c365985c8f22c4a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4975040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Barizon","original_name":"Rodrigo Barizon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fca0d46c365985c8f22c5c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4975041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duda Ribas","original_name":"Duda Ribas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fca0e367b2a16466d05789","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Favilla","original_name":"Ricardo Favilla","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611a0691f3319017dc230a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Favilla","original_name":"Ricardo Favilla","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc9fda6329d032d8d05991","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4975038,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcia Zanelatto","original_name":"Marcia Zanelatto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fc9ff7bae383c10cd0594d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429004,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luciana Boal Marinho","original_name":"Luciana Boal Marinho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fca00e7e9037323759450a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Graça","original_name":"Alberto Graça","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fca070bae383c10cd0595f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4418711,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Isabel Paranhos","original_name":"Isabel Paranhos","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fca07a25b61c33da5942e4","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747452,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cleumo Segond","original_name":"Cleumo Segond","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fca08467b2a16466d05765","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1156,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/ayLxrpPBx37lP0bmvwb2tTg43Dg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":770}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Festival do Rio","release_date":"2024-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
