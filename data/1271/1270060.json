The video combines footage of the Operation Dominic nuclear test (Christmas Island, 1962) and the Ilulissat Glacier Calving Event (Western Greenland, 2008) to create a metaphorical anthropogenic landscape. This work was part of the\r installation “Fragments of the Acceleration,” which was developed through a combination of archival research, research into scientific, historical, and cultural perspectives of the Great Acceleration, the Anthropocene, and the climate crisis, as well as an exploration of contemporary perspectives of the climate crisis as represented in broadcast media.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anthropogenic Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Bauer","original_name":"Brandon Bauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66102b312d531a017d7ed402","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
