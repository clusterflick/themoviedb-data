This work explores the depth of two contrasting territories which have both undergone a colonial history. Working out the contrasts and resonances of these two contexts, this work investigates the identity and memory of places but also the strange sensation of reality given by a hybrid and fictional landscape which combines elements that do not belong together.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moved Landscapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annabelle Fouquet","original_name":"Annabelle Fouquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661277e21108a801648d2372","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
