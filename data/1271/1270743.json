The resulting piece brings together scenes of the students reciting text in unison, excerpts of their imaginative responses to Oursler's question, and found footage of the compulsive online gaming, shorthand sms text messaging, and YouTube improvisational recordings that characterize their environment. Through this combination of spoken text and frenetic gaming images, Oursler highlights disparate notions of fantasy, and gives new voice to the layered story-telling that threads through his work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9dSukattdYDrG7IMmHQtIgEU88C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Are We Going to Have to Go Through with This Again?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Oursler","original_name":"Tony Oursler","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/lcn8zD8Z6rSYQ8Owo6IYvZWvWuV.jpg","credit_id":"6611c783b09bde0164bcb9d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9dSukattdYDrG7IMmHQtIgEU88C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
