The Canyon Crest Academy student filmmakers who created this documentary attend the same public school district where members of Switchfoot grew up and developed their love for music, surf, and beach culture. A production of the school program CCA-TV and Envision Cinema, this short film focuses on the band members' desire to give back to the community that invested in them when they were teens.","popularity":0.0948,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Switchfoot:
