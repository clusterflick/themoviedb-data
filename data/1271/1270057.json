There are over 200,000 Arab-Bedouins living in the Negev region of Israel today, with access to one single swimming pool that was inaugurated in the Bedouin town of Rahat in 2017. Bedouins are not allowed to enter swimming pools in Jewish localities. The work deals with the lack of swimming pools due to discrimination, but in a future world, in a few years or a little more, there may be a shortage of water due to global warming, drought and evaporation as well.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swimming Lesson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4636048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vardit Goldner","original_name":"Vardit Goldner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66102a7fd861af017df418b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
