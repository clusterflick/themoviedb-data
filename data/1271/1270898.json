Her best friend is Eda Nur (11). There has just been an earthquake 400 km away from where they live. Through the news they learn that many people have died and buildings have collapsed. With the backdrop of fearing the possibility of an earthquake hitting where the girls live, we learn about their friendship and its ups and downs. The girls have to prepare for their first Turkish bagpipe concert. But Emine is jealous of Eda Nur’s skills and that challenges her in keeping up the good friendship. Through the interactions between the two girls, we hope for Emine to acknowledge that she and Eda Nur are good at different things and that she sees the strengths of that in their friendship.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Best Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2554447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Hougen-Moraga","original_name":"Marianne Hougen-Moraga","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hR85b7Qj5P3UwbqMHO3hJ4jVwr0.jpg","credit_id":"66121ec3356a71017d24e729","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Olympia International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
