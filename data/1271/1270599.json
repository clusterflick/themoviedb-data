He has offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Berlin, Glasgow and London. While other international practices have succumbed to commercial pressures, Foster has retained a reputation for innovation and originality. He is also highly respected for his flair when adapting or converting older buildings to present-day needs. His designs are always rooted in his concern for minimal environmental damage and maximum technological efficiency. This film follows Foster at work in his office and on the site of some of his major new projects, including the Law Faculty at Cambridge University and the telecommunications tower in Santiago de Compostela. Foster is a man driven by his passion for architecture and his perfectionism. This portrait reveals not only his genius, but also his highly sensitive and artistic personality.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/5jzzm1ybYU5v06TINg426leebjM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norman Foster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kidel","original_name":"Mark Kidel","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661156a7d768fe017b4262d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32032240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jzzm1ybYU5v06TINg426leebjM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
