From Paris to Oslo, from La Palma to Istanbul, the protagonists recount their broken story and their personal revolution, through their artistic practice. While painting the portrait of a generation of creative and independent women, the film generates a reflection around the sense of belonging and the role that art plays to rebuild and reinvent oneself away from home.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Échappées","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2429636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katia Jarjoura","original_name":"Katia Jarjoura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611afa31fa1c8017cd282cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
