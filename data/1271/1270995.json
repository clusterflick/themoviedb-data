Filmed spontaneously across the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, six enthusiasts share their impressions of their summer pastime, while a philosophy teacher and a well-known anthropologist (Bernard Arcand) compare their interpretations of the phenomenon in a clear-sighted, concrete way. Bric à Brac bypasses commonplaces to reflect on our consumer habits, our relationship with objects and the importance of territoriality in the practice of this inevitable activity that colors (or embarrasses!) our summers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bric à Brac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Guérin","original_name":"Martin Guérin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661279f61108a8017d8e60b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
