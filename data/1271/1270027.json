He shoots and processes them entirely on his phone in order to bring the active video \"meaning-making\" process into his daily lived experience. His camera (and NLE) is always in his pocket. Lodestar takes advantage of synergies and leaps among some of these loops and then extends them toward proto-narrative --the moment when an objective narrative is first detected. Sound is integral to the potential for an in-depth experience during this video.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fNHBwBDlgM7hGJTZCRDsl6JQQVv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wasp Radial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leighton Pierce","original_name":"Leighton Pierce","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/yPQEX7xbdJmVN49JtQ8TV62RjiU.jpg","credit_id":"6610214b3e6f2b017d39d11e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fNHBwBDlgM7hGJTZCRDsl6JQQVv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
