As the two were inseparable, it soon became known that they would soon marry. This news greatly displeased Bill Higgins, who promptly set about to make trouble. He wrote an anonymous note and attached it to Ben's saddle, saying \" She don't love you. She was with Bill Higgins all day yesterday. A Friend.\" When Ben found it he frowned and tucked it idly into his pocket. This happened regularly thereafter. If Ben had been a trifle older he might have smiled derisively, but he didn't. Youth and jealousy are old acquaintances and so Ben made his visits shorter and shorter. One day, lonesomeness overcame him and he sent the notes in a bundle to Margy. She read them and promptly burst into tears.","popularity":0.2212,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Youth and Jealousy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"620aaa2a29733800b955a08a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2334575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Rich","original_name":"Vivian Rich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8N0e2etPMt1wist0a8iOCdGwE20.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margaret","credit_id":"620aaa38a313b8001bb3a36c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Field","original_name":"George Field","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/xttgd3AAhejnHpvCIASVUceDIGv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bill Higgins","credit_id":"620aaa46cae17c00429fdec5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Pallette","original_name":"Eugene Pallette","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/y3n1c9qjmJzGeZWihwm0QWlmDoR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"620aaa4e1cac8c008d1404ac","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835632,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theodosia Harris","original_name":"Theodosia Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620aaa1cdbad5000422dcd1c","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","credit_id":"620aaa11945d36004274f26b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003580","wikidata_id":"Q15865126","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
