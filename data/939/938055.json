BERLINER is a documentary film that exposes assumptions about, and issues for, women of Turkish background living in Berlin: navigating wearing (or not wearing) the headscarf, a classist education system and sensationalist media stories about their lives. BERLINER explores the lives of first, second and third generation women and their real struggles, as Muslims, and as part of the largest minority group in Berlin: post-war, post-Wall and post 9/11.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/f8sDkYCylEmFihHjtPhxDxtBeM7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"WALLS TAKE MANY FORMS","title":"Berliner","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Nelson","original_name":"Kim Nelson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620881eb1bf26600ce7481c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kOVJLbxButPq72sL5hCBqETohuZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ElRG1O97Rvpcec1FEzVhRTCgIE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8sDkYCylEmFihHjtPhxDxtBeM7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Berliner Trailer","key":"76956526","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-15T13:37:41.000Z","id":"6208813f014325001b56a3a6"}]}}}
