Fleegix is a beverage enjoyed by Martians. At the heart of the film is a dispute as to how this substance is manufactured. While Upstate Martians believe Fleegix is made from berries, the Hand Shadow Punks of Baltimore (who represent a pre-cinematic faction) believe the beverage is made from light converted through automobiles containing animalcules. The conflict about the origin of Fleegix acquires symbolic and mythological proportions.  The film investigates the nature of belief systems which are superimposed on a physical space. This is less a film than an organism or ecosystem of connected notions which is never completed.","popularity":0.0559,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FLEEGIX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Thurber","original_name":"Matthew Thurber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"620ac297a313b80066c4a054","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dayton","original_name":"Robert Dayton","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/pLBMEc1DM3dJyvkjVdhXJlhkBAq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Homunculus","credit_id":"663da17de0d47a677c308aaf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Thurber","original_name":"Matthew Thurber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ac2b71cac8c00b77f01ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
