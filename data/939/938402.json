For most people, home is permanent, private and secure. Here, however, Hu focuses on the instability and insecurity of 'home' for homeless people. Drawing is used as an exploratory tool to try to understand their experiences. This contributed to a proposal for ways in which disused urban interiors might house homeless people and those seeking asylum.  This short film is one of the winning entries to The Architecture Drawing Prize 2021, a collaboration between Make Architects, the World Architecture Festival, and Sir John Soane's Museum.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/yZQ86GUbr9oAAyyJd17PMUkiTT6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Un)homeliness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3425797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boji Hu","original_name":"Boji Hu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62098be730f79c006c9acd41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZQ86GUbr9oAAyyJd17PMUkiTT6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
