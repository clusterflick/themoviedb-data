Color aerial footage by American cameramen of the ruins of Berlin in 1945 tells of life in a wasteland of rubble. These shots of Berlin's rubble landscape are juxtaposed with the metropolis of today's years, the development comes alive, from the new beginning after 1945 to the division of the city in 1961, from the different urban development in West and East Berlin until the fall of the Berlin Wall. Aerial photographs from 1992, '97 and '99 document the lively construction activity after the fall of the Wall. Yesterday and today become particularly clear at three prominent points: Potsdamer Platz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin - Ruine 1945 - Metropole 2000","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0425773","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
