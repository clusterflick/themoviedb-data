See and listen to the work which is justly considered the ultimate in difficulty - both musically and technically - Chopin's 24 Etudes . This is a first opportunity to be able to watch Chopin Etudes from the unique vantage point of performer herself . Never before were the cameras so close up to the red-hot keyboard , following the hands like the pianist's eyes would do . The magnificent sound comes from 1923 Wigmore Hall Boesendorfer Concert Grand Piano.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ppKyalZZwULvC6UwrTUKLvq5yAn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Valentina Lisitsa","title":"Valentina Lisitsa - F.
