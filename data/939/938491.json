She is given a mission that will decide the existence of the company; the wedding preparations of Eun Min Se, daughter of one of the biggest Japanese investors of the company.  Min Se was brought up without a mother or siblings. Reckless and troublesome, Ha Kyung has a tough time taking care of her and is sensitive enough as it is but she finds out that the groom is no other than the man she divorced five years ago, Seo In Jae.  In Jae suggests she puts someone else in charge of the project but she rejects the idea. This project will decide the position of branch manager for her and she couldn't risk it. Ha Kyung tells him instead if he had any feelings left for her, to suck it up and just walk down the aisle. That's the only way she can become a branch manager.","popularity":0.1998,"poster_path":"/jAcWQvytlp3AKOoBdsByVKvcLzi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77994,"logo_path":"/mQcOwCeEkNJV3Iryh4YyKimXXPJ.png","name":"KBS Media","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wedding Planner","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"As: Another Wedding","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Another Wedding","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1235477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Soo-hyun","original_name":"홍수현","popularity":0.4448,"profile_path":"/crYEnuEXdskJ6NNnL9ARvMf9HiU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chae Ha Kyung","credit_id":"6209e8ddc56d2d0041094e70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Yi-han","original_name":"진이한","popularity":0.3985,"profile_path":"/96wMfWIFEQgDFlxVCtKpghvh1lj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Seo In Jae","credit_id":"6209e97438e5100114ee8808","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Fujii","original_name":"藤井美菜","popularity":0.9344,"profile_path":"/w9ffvOSByR75J6oWhWQVEEoerWe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eun Min Se","credit_id":"6209e9a530f79c00d328b2c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":496935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seong Byeong-suk","original_name":"성병숙","popularity":0.4744,"profile_path":"/cFVOqICCoXVgdBTip1ZwgGlXqw2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"[Ha Kyung's mother]","credit_id":"6209e9d47aecc6004307189c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Seul-ki","original_name":"김슬기","popularity":0.4559,"profile_path":"/u86TkLLd1PLxAvCgSQvr89tWDWP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Han Ji Hye","credit_id":"6209e9ede04aca0068ca82e4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Min-kyo","original_name":"김민교","popularity":0.4029,"profile_path":"/kB54YQcI18UDmFbYPKAI6LtPe1z.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6209ea079408ec0042236dd1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1029192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Hae-In","original_name":"Kang Hae-In","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/1oYtFH37mPRSOsNovyS80UXqQRm.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6209f39b26dac1004261642d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Je-in","original_name":"Lee Je-in","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6209ea8f1d78f200db485e07","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935381,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeon Chan-ho","original_name":"Jeon Chan-ho","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6209ea79945d3600db2af473","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAcWQvytlp3AKOoBdsByVKvcLzi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
