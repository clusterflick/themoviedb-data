After tiring of his mistress, Hampton tells Lola that he is planning to marry a \"good woman\" who will exert the proper influence over his son Irwin. Begging Hampton to marry her, Lola confesses that she too has a son, who is being reared in a religious institution for homeless children, but Hampton insists that he must not darken his son's future. Thirsting for revenge, Lola determines to marry Irwin. After inebriating the youth, Lola takes Irwin to the minister, who refuses to perform the ceremony. Too drunk to realize that there has been no wedding, Irwin takes Lola home and introduces her as his wife.","popularity":0.192,"poster_path":"/554gz7gGzSbPtDiVGbLAOlavhLw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Strange Transgressor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lola Montrose","credit_id":"620982d0f48b340040696eac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
