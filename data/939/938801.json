That is to say Bessie loved an idol, a very perishable clay idol much addicted to the use of liquor. Shortly after their marriage, Bob came home reeling drunk. Bessie tried in vain to break him but, with the further use of the poison, Bob fell into evil ways, returned home but seldom and then only to maltreat and abuse her. A day came when Bessie could no longer stand the strain; so she packed her small belongings and dolefully went forth to seek new joys in new fields.","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Innocent Marriage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Will Wayne","credit_id":"620aff36e7c097002a258fc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Field","original_name":"George Field","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/xttgd3AAhejnHpvCIASVUceDIGv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bob Evans","credit_id":"620aff459c97bd002b254c81","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","credit_id":"620aff1ced96bc002d56922c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835632,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theodosia Harris","original_name":"Theodosia Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620aff278c44b9002c0c54fa","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002942","wikidata_id":"Q28497520","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
