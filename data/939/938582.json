He is sick, old and his name has started to fade from the public consciousness. His wife Carlotta Monterey is far from supporting, in fact she constantly reminds him of his shortcomings and unfulfilled dreams. Their sons, Eugene Jr. and Shane come to congratulate him (and perhaps expecting to get some money). But they are unable to help their father, since they have their own problems: Eugene Jr. is an alcoholic, Shane is doing drugs.","popularity":0.2323,"poster_path":"/24trlfG9HDI2atgi56w15nOQhcE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Och ge oss skuggorna","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Andersson","original_name":"Peter Andersson","popularity":0.4834,"profile_path":"/3QrCFAESqlCgwg10KLv1Wre0sKL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shane","credit_id":"620a5b01945d36001bd9bc21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reine Brynolfsson","original_name":"Reine Brynolfsson","popularity":0.2033,"profile_path":"/xDtDGJEeAEPpcDg7oS1Sn5deFuF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eugene Jr.","credit_id":"620a5b12e04aca009516f2c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaretha Krook","original_name":"Margaretha Krook","popularity":0.2096,"profile_path":"/eIfMDQG8oaU2Vt5xbYt4vS6ftja.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carlotta O'Neill","credit_id":"620a5b2726dac100b875bee2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lakke Magnusson","original_name":"Lakke Magnusson","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/ySHbjKQw13pZTw80h29YpJz5Pgu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Saki","credit_id":"620a5b3d1cac8c0043abd064","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max von Sydow","original_name":"Max von Sydow","popularity":1.4935,"profile_path":"/u16BsGyT6v9yuO7wWAF62NayDth.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eugene O'Neill","credit_id":"620a5b55cae17c00429f549b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lars Norén","original_name":"Lars Norén","popularity":0.0963,"profile_path":"/pBeJ5BOTMBA0WRK3ok9iUPPwQvo.jpg","credit_id":"620a5b841d78f23c5a128041","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Björn Melander","original_name":"Björn Melander","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620a5ba3f48b34497cec84d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xj94dB3Do07otfbeccPkDTDEMxI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1430,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/24trlfG9HDI2atgi56w15nOQhcE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1028}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
