The film portrays the life of three migrant workers: a construction worker from Bulgaria who lives on the streets of Frankfurt collecting bottles for a living; a woman from Romania who shares a hotel room with her daughters, everyday she goes out to find work; and a retiree from Bulgaria who drives a truck and has been on the road for four months to support his family back home. Their daily lives are determined by bleak monotony and social isolation, and yet they have not abandoned their hope for a better life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/obrn10I9v46NPY7zTNQFDBGhCli.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World We Live In: Wandering Workers in Germany","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Um uns die Welt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835448,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nina Prange","original_name":"Nina Prange","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62090dad29733800f7af16a2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835446,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sofiia Melnyk","original_name":"Sofiia Melnyk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62090dc01bf26600699a9047","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3424948,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benjamin Manderbach","original_name":"Benjamin Manderbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62090dd3c56d2d0041081a24","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3424949,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frank Carsten Walter","original_name":"Frank Carsten Walter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62090de635a61e00421d332c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3424947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Fischer","original_name":"Hanna Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62090d8938e5100114ed5aec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835448,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nina Prange","original_name":"Nina Prange","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62090da20143257d582bb508","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18236128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/obrn10I9v46NPY7zTNQFDBGhCli.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Neisse Film Festival (Informal festival date)","release_date":"2016-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival (informal festival date)","release_date":"2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The World We Live In / Um uns die Welt | Trailer (2016)","key":"1JnNRZU4XXU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-10-14T08:14:38.000Z","id":"62090d46cae17c00429d4d64"}]}}}
