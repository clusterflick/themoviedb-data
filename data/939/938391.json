Curtis, who is not as talented as he believes himself to be, fails at his job but is saved by his wife Anita, a former actress, who has forsaken her career for marriage. Anita and her old manager, Bruce Winthrope, fashion the play to suit Viola, and Vanity becomes a huge success. The play's triumph enlarges Curtis's ego even further, and he deserts Anita for Viola.","popularity":0.279,"poster_path":"/98S3IK6sIRu65HA5MOD7r6FeKHG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idolators","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Viola Strathmore","credit_id":"6209852326dac1001b847510","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2317657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Webb","original_name":"George Webb","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/6LBbIGJGPZbA8nCW0LNvGRem7zV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Curtis de Forest Ralston","credit_id":"62098533f48b34011dc31922","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1567605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorcas Matthews","original_name":"Dorcas Matthews","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Anita Carew","credit_id":"6209853fcae17c00429e20fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Hill","original_name":"Lee Hill","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Borul","credit_id":"62098552014325008d236b7c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Guise","original_name":"Tom Guise","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/bXTQvjO4qKwiWlvobaBb3klmqdi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Burr Britton","credit_id":"62098560e33f83008ea28211","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1797547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo B.
