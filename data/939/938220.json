Anne fancies herself in love with Henri Levesnue, a Frenchman. So when he is reported to have brought in the biggest prize she is delighted. But the following day, Joe Eagle, a quarter-breed, reaches the station with twice Henri's catch, Ben insists that Anne marry Joe, but she swears she never could become the wife of the French Indian, and because he really loves her, Joe, who has overheard her protestations, hides half his furs under his cabin floor. Anne is married to Henri, but in a few months is very unhappy. He is a heavy drinker; he neglects her, and at last, being penniless, he steals a bale of furs from the station. The factor sets Joe to catch the thief.","popularity":0.2253,"poster_path":"/amkt9DAHvh9YxCqq8c71c3MUELl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Domino Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Land of the Otter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"62091eefcae17c00c2c1309c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.2085,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Joe Eagle","credit_id":"62091f009408ec006817c61b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Storm","original_name":"Jerome Storm","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Henri Levesque","credit_id":"62091f0efab3fa001f696e8a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Laidlaw","original_name":"Roy Laidlaw","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ben Anderson","credit_id":"62091f1c38e510006a579478","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Edwards","original_name":"Walter Edwards","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/s0eNParqKLFe1oXKhSMt4BpBJKz.jpg","credit_id":"62091ecbaf2da8001c09002e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931237,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas H.
