Meanwhile, back in the States, Harry Teal, scheming to steal a mine claim, hires Jane's brother Dick to do his dirty work in Alaska. After Jane accompanies her brother up North, Teal, who has designs on Jane, begins to fear that she will go back to Dave and so plots to discredit him by igniting the jealousy of Kate's admirer, Jim Sykes. Teal succeeds, and in the violent fight that erupts between Dave and Sykes, Sykes is shot by an unknown hand. While pursuing Sykes' assailant, Dave discovers Jane, but their reunion is cut short when Dave is arrested for the shooting.","popularity":0.1495,"poster_path":"/uaK5RR7PzrSq5UymWOasvtGGXdm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163283,"logo_path":null,"name":"The American Lifeograph Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Novak","original_name":"Jane Novak","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/8EFBVUt1LZUjGP8yKcg8k92ZJ3x.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"'Faro' Kate / Jane Sunderlin","credit_id":"62094375fab3fa00e7d4461d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Livingston","original_name":"Jack Livingston","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/y7Gs83nnlnPo7kvf6R16nYsMcmM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dave Langdon","credit_id":"62094383d7fbda0093226eb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Harry Teal","credit_id":"6209438f35a61e008f4c8db6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Sprotte","original_name":"Bert Sprotte","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/tvVZs3dunBBfL32jPvHGHU5ujFU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jim Sykes","credit_id":"6209439d931ea100679be049","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Matieson","original_name":"Otto Matieson","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/3ogR6169p5FaDr4lahC8RZa7PJZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dick Sunderlin","credit_id":"620943abcae17c37db5bafc2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Ernest Garcia","original_name":"Al Ernest Garcia","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":"/pz1VDUCBCvNiZ8qAHg9N4ejXmSX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jean the Half-Breed","credit_id":"620943b8c56d2d0041086059","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Broderick O'Farrell","original_name":"Broderick O'Farrell","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/jQRXAuy5Lr0HwlmsYwVmHx8nRmN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bill Lee","credit_id":"620943c6cb802838de05927b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dills","original_name":"William Dills","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mJ6u30AkN9F5hbhV5BCX9FgbXh7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"The Dean","credit_id":"620943da85867800b66abf31","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Hersholt","original_name":"Allan Hersholt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Little Jack","credit_id":"620943e7931ea100bc7aee90","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis H.
