Here she meets 'Chuck' Hemingway, who despite his rough exterior is likewise a child of wealth, and a Yale graduate to boot. When Van Ness violently rejects his romantic overtures, Hemingway turns to an old Indian chum for advice. The Indian suggests rather chauvinistically that the way to win a headstrong girl is to \"tame\" her -- that is, treat 'er rough and make 'er like it.","popularity":0.3036,"poster_path":"/a1APOLxbPfL3sWo2QNjZEMmkKtJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Iron Strain","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Farnum","original_name":"Dustin Farnum","popularity":0.2214,"profile_path":"/1tOE9Tv8P2pQWWpPUecl70SzT7z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"'Chuck' Hemingway","credit_id":"6209669cef8b3200e0568c13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enid Markey","original_name":"Enid Markey","popularity":0.2145,"profile_path":"/ihoIvZF4nk59zhleufqy0clpSGa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Octavia Van Ness","credit_id":"620966aa85867800b66ae820","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles K.
