From Tokyo to Hong Kong and Bangkok to Seoul, this two-part documentary describes how Asian directors have successfully married the power of local myths and superstitions with cutting-edge filming techniques and innovative storytelling, producing some of the scariest moments in the history of cinema. True Asian Horror includes scenes from The Ring - the movie voted by cinemagoers around the world as the scariest movie ever - and modern horror classics such as The Eye and Phone. Sit back as the directors of these classic films reveal how they manage to frighten the life out of their audiences and hear film critics explain why Hollywood is terrified to turn its back on Asian moviemakers whose meteoric rise to the top has been just plain scary.","popularity":0.1413,"poster_path":"/czkRDqwDOJgUNC5Bywvchtqhl4A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"True Asian Horror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideo Nakata","original_name":"中田秀夫","popularity":0.3816,"profile_path":"/nGrrV7iZeYORB3VD4lfqYY8xFHy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620b305b81da390067799129","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Pang Fat","original_name":"彭發","popularity":0.3943,"profile_path":"/A7jZ7cjEdWufEwN5Eh7CiIknLX7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620b30685b2f4700696f40b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekachai Uekrongtham","original_name":"Ekachai Uekrongtham","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/ftc4Ui6rzNK0BjCS0XrCfsFVoQe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620b3078ca8354001cd53e7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nonzee Nimibutr","original_name":"Nonzee Nimibutr","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/5WFeCdlunAZkjGn7rAwrVIpRlze.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620b3086245dbe004745d560","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oxide Pang Shun","original_name":"彭順","popularity":0.3748,"profile_path":"/l783aPnVADG5i3ZBEExJoojCjfU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620b30944e6742004492f02c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bindu Mathur","original_name":"Bindu Mathur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620b30d8ca8354006ae951fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Foster","original_name":"Kristina Foster","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620b30e7c3514c001b50774b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bindu Mathur","original_name":"Bindu Mathur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620b30f1498bc20042f840a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1031287","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2988,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/czkRDqwDOJgUNC5Bywvchtqhl4A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
