He refuses to accompany her shopping one afternoon and leaves, meeting another girl, whom he takes to the theater. Mrs. Barr is all broken up. She is visited by a friend who suggests that they go to a matinee. They do so and Mrs. Barr discovers Mr. Barr in a box with the other woman. She leaves very much broken up. She attempts suicide on a railroad track, but is frightened by the rumbling of the train. She next visits a drug store where her nervous manner gives away her intention to the druggist. Instead of giving her cyanide of potassium as she requests he gives her a bottle of plain water, marking it cyanide of potassium.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/i2ClEgXrNakkGYSsh1AWsW1PVwo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broncho Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Case of Poison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Barr","credit_id":"6209306d1cac8c0043aaa752","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Nelson","original_name":"Jack Nelson","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/287tmZiqPIXmMr1p88x2wBenWf2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Barr","credit_id":"6209307c1cac8c001b32e2cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2517007,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Virginia Philley Withey","original_name":"Virginia Philley Withey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Edith","credit_id":"6209308b0143251de328bcd0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3425210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Heffer","original_name":"Edna Heffer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Servant","credit_id":"6209309d93388b0066440eed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Fisher","original_name":"George Fisher","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/gK8RRwzwBGksl3laSh0ALzH2E4F.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"620930a6c56d2d009ed681ef","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Sidney","original_name":"Scott Sidney","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6209305acae17c37db5b9171","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0423964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i2ClEgXrNakkGYSsh1AWsW1PVwo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
