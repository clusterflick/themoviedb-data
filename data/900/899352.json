Despite the danger, Sandra, a single middle-aged reporter living there, continues to search for stories, even after waking up with symptoms one day. As a public service, she turns the camera on herself for the first time in her career, documenting her condition and recording the sights and sounds of the afflicted city on her way to the hospital.

With her remaining strength, she brings herself to Quiapo Church, the site frequented by many pilgrims in dire situations.","popularity":0.6573,"poster_path":"/cO3W0dL5r6w1G8zp94yRNCsC40z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97110,"logo_path":"/1toa2pYfVKn3EyIJv2S8yC4ADbX.png","name":"Project 8 Projects","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Myth of Manila","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","title":"Mito ng Maynila","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Myth of Manila","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":462483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angeli Bayani","original_name":"Angeli Bayani","popularity":0.1953,"profile_path":"/8lESf7mxEKl9ETLOfMO91ol2MmD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6194e71f9d592c002a495899","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janus Victoria","original_name":"Janus Victoria","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6194e752d768fe008e4cfdb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janus Victoria","original_name":"Janus Victoria","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6194e72befca00002b872b21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085230,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Neil Daza","original_name":"Neil Daza","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/up70A11S5v6peGR5nV0GcB1UCuT.jpg","credit_id":"6194e78ff9475b00636d6852","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A9ZqRLPCeYyqKltVANgBj4J02Dw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cO3W0dL5r6w1G8zp94yRNCsC40z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11479,"name":"social commentary"},{"id":11322,"name":"female protagonist"},{"id":158651,"name":"realism"},{"id":188973,"name":"pandemic"},{"id":263237,"name":"covid-19"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Myth of Manila_Trailer","key":"643164345","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-07T10:25:57.000Z","id":"6194e8ac4da3d4008cbec18b"}]}}}
