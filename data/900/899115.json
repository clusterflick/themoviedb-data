The world has become saturated by a toxic fog that destroys all life forms and replaces oxygen with poison. He spends his days fighting to survive, as his resources quickly dwindle. On a night when all seems lost, a nymph crashes outside Dumontâ€™s bunker. In a sudden act of bravery, he dons his final tank of oxygen and leaves the safety of the station. Gathering the wounded Nymph in his arms, Dumont risks his life to return the glowing creature to the peak of the red mountain. In his quest to save his new charge, Dumont risks his life and, in doing so, discovers hope beyond the fog.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/piw8ABb4oj4uw0h1MUySNY1prnr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forbidden Zone","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Tolchinsky","original_name":"Zach Tolchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6194036f258823005f1a1ac2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Tolchinsky","original_name":"Zach Tolchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619403748e2ba6009215784c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candace Hammer","original_name":"Candace Hammer","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/5IkBMeh0CFggM4Ax7YhNyb7zAyB.jpg","credit_id":"6194039effc9de00646199a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Tolchinsky","original_name":"Zach Tolchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bf5851b72940122f4d4a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Tolchinsky","original_name":"Zach Tolchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bf58e6c19ea01281e070b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2691678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Michael Cardon","original_name":"Paul Michael Cardon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bf59d4f33ad012a56c6ba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19707046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/piw8ABb4oj4uw0h1MUySNY1prnr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/51z5EVBm8PbxaZmuw34ppfI3JZb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lVp4FcpInwGB3fMYL88kr2ix6CJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spark Animation Festival","release_date":"2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
