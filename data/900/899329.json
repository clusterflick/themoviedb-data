In this fantastical village, a puppeteer manipulates the characters in a kind of shadow play that seems to be activated by musicians and actors. The film poses multiple political questions about justice, self-defense, politics and migration. Amorales’ visual vocabulary confronts us with these topics as he suggests that our vision of the world is shaped by pre-existing languages and social codes.","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Aldea Maldita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
