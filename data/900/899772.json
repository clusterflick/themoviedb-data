He made three Gospel albums, winning a Grammy for \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\" However, his radical new direction alienated fans and enraged critics as he preached evangelical messages. In his first-ever interview, Dylan's Bible class teacher, Pastor Bill Dwyer, describes Dylan's born-again transformation. Legendary Slow Train Coming producer Jerry Wexler, background singer Regina McCrary, keyboardist Spooner Oldham, songwriter Al Kasha, San Francisco Chronicle rock reporter Joel Selvin, AJ Weberman and others tell the tale of Bob Dylan's Gospel Years. Director & Producer Joel Gilbert weaves the story of this monumental period of Dylan's life and music through revealing insider portraits, exclusive photos, live concert video and TV footage from 1975-1981, with visits to Rundown Studios, the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, the Vineyard Church, and the Fox Warfield Theatre.","popularity":0.2282,"poster_path":"/ijxO7WysaPMLT6n4M1un58ry84b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highway 61 Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":241,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Covering the period after Dylan gave his life to Christ.","title":"Bob Dylan 1975-1981: Rolling Thunder and the Gospel Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":116329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Gilbert","original_name":"Joel Gilbert","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Producer/Director","credit_id":"61966f47497560004321dc40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter","original_name":"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter","popularity":0.2541,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61966f8a67b6130044769cba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2335057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scarlet Rivera","original_name":"Scarlet Rivera","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":"/3Nhg9yD8nsuIC3KEDM7XJqQ8tCP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61966fd81feac100661548af","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":116329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Gilbert","original_name":"Joel Gilbert","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6196701ceb14fa002b5551a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":798,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ijxO7WysaPMLT6n4M1un58ry84b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186,"name":"christianity"},{"id":5708,"name":"gospel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
