Exploring as well as highlighting the struggles and complexities around issues of race, stereotypes and belonging, this experimental essay film demonstrates how connected those larger issues are to personal, lived experience. Ultimately, with emphasis on the present and the future of race relations in America, the film challenges and encourages us to constantly question and reimagine our own positional privilege.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/yFchwS1BasBGRA9b9DCPuJW29GZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time to Leave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3315016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léwugà Benson","original_name":"Léwugà Benson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61967450a0f1a20042dd8171","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFchwS1BasBGRA9b9DCPuJW29GZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2020-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
