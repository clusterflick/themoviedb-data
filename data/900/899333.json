The first film, titled Death Note: Rewrite Genshi Suru Kami or Death Note: Relight Visions of a God, condenses the events of the series' first half. The second film, titled Death Note: Rewrite 2 L o Tsugu Mono or Death Note: Relight 2 L's Successors, does the same for the series' latter half.  In addition to being shorter, the story's setting and timeline have also changed. Some new scenes and dialogue were introduced—especially in the second film—and the first film is now presented as a reminiscence of the death god Ryuk.","popularity":0.3169,"poster_path":"/pUCxVsSLC1BHUn74Co3WhJk2JuG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Note Rewrite - Collection","video":false,"vote_average":5.083,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pUCxVsSLC1BHUn74Co3WhJk2JuG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dPKBZKOQICVzbjhmlogjV36sapa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
