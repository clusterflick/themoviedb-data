A man's hand reaches out to her and tells her to snap the phone. The woman says, \"Shut up and hit the man. The woman hits the man, saying, \"You're always talking on the phone like that, living off the support of others. I'm on my own. The way you live is the problem. The man says. In fact, the man tries to have an affair and gets dumped. I thought the story would go like this, but it didn't go at all. This film was made based on a film shot in a seminar for fourth-year students at Tama Art University. The actors were students who participated in the seminar. They wanted to make a film about a story, so I asked each student to tell a story, which I transcribed, made into a scenario, and filmed them acting and talking. Rather than creating a \"story,\" the work was composed of everyday scenes, with the idea of a \"story\" in mind. I have just begun to think about stories that make time.
