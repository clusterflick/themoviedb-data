As I was talking with her, she told me that she loves to pull out hair, and when I asked her about it, her story touched on the sense of life. I decided to film her talking about it. She said that when she pulls out her own hair, she gets excited because she is aware of both herself pulling out and herself being pulled out. Skin is a problem, she said. As I was filming, I was surprised to find that her story had become a great theory of the body. For the introduction, I borrowed a song by Hikashu. Produced in 1981. The artist was 46 years old.
