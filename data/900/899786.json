The Blue Nile, and the Blue Grotto. The grotto is lit by light that is refracted through the water from a small opening five feet high into a vast canon. The ferrymen sing 'O Sole Mio'. The silent magic is broken.  Black blue sadness in Geertgen's 'Nativity at Night'. The virginal blue robe which mirrors the blue sky is swallowed by black.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rbxqTPG2Bk0OUcd2QITwu1mBmtk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Year Is Passing (In the Roaring Waters)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Rampton","original_name":"Felix Rampton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61966fd529733800430bc868","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rbxqTPG2Bk0OUcd2QITwu1mBmtk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
