Every morning, miners from surrounding neighbourhoods gathered here to put on their gears and got into the minecarts, heading underground into pitch darkness. They worked non-stop in challenging conditions of high stress and high temperature, providing Taiwan with an indispensable source of energy. This documentary celebrates the miners’ contribution, but also stirred up controversy due to its inaccurate report of their wages.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heroes with No Name: Coal Miners in Ruifang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hsia Tsu-hui","original_name":"Hsia Tsu-hui","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6195e4c825b9550062c21073","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
