It illuminates the sustaining, transformative powers of film by transforming a variety of “waves” from cinematic history—ocean waves, waving hands, waves of soldiers—through the luma waveform scope, a technical feature of movie editing software. Converted into luma waveforms, the original filmic images are rendered unrecognizable, their representational nature exchanged for a ghostly, mesmerizing shimmer.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/kdldKT4xPYG87cBCnCOh4m5UEa2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wave Form","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3133617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Brock","original_name":"Margaret Brock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Luma","credit_id":"6196663ba0f1a2008efdff04","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2883647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiz","original_name":"Tiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619665d5fc5f06006ac4131f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314917,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Upjohn","original_name":"Tom Upjohn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619665e471458f004293310f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott McCrorie","original_name":"Scott McCrorie","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619665efeb14fa009244d21a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2883647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiz","original_name":"Tiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6196660f1feac100661533f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314923,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryanne Kap","original_name":"Ryanne Kap","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6196662e67b613009469b6cd","department":"Production","job":"Production Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Samaras","original_name":"Alex Samaras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61966622abdafc002a213e26","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2883647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiz","original_name":"Tiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619665cfae384300426f408b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott McCrorie","original_name":"Scott McCrorie","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61966602bc2cb30090ca0818","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott McCrorie","original_name":"Scott McCrorie","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619665f9eb14fa009244d21d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2883647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiz","original_name":"Tiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619665dcae3843006172717a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mara Nesrallah","original_name":"Mara Nesrallah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619666189512e1002aff4b8a","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kdldKT4xPYG87cBCnCOh4m5UEa2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2020-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
