Drew is crippled by the need of his comfortable place or his safe place. His distractions are, in his mind, medicinal to his mental health, and we see that in the opening of the film while he plays video games with friends. Although, after winning a game with his online friends, his mind is forced back into the inner battle he faces daily. After battling with the realization of his own fear to confront himself about his own hidden issues, Drew realizes that his distractions are that of his aide when hiding from himself. He even dreams of what he uses to clear his mind from the usual inner turmoil from within. In due time, Drew immerses himself in an environment where he feels safe and comfortable again. Yet, this time, he stays there and questions whether or not this entire inner battle he faces is all a part of a beautiful dream in disguise.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164683,"logo_path":null,"name":"24K Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An avid player of hide and seek comes to realize who he is truly hiding from.","title":"HIDE","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3313637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Coleman","original_name":"Drew Coleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Drew","credit_id":"61951be54da3d40061f08506","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3313637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Coleman","original_name":"Drew Coleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61951c31efca0000441662e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
