It sounds like a book lover's fantasy, and maybe it is. The bookseller, Libero, knows most of his rather eccentric customers and can barely bring himself to take their money (although fascists pay double). When a young boy, Essien (Didie Lorenz Tchumbu), an émigré from Burkina Faso, happens on the shop, Libero begins lending him books of increasing difficulty. From Pinocchio to Moby Dick, Essien can read as fast as Libero can lend, and the two form a bond over reading and meaning. \"Books should be read twice,\" Libero says. \"Once to understand them, and once to think.\" Life should probably be lived like that too, but the bookseller's name means \"free,\" and freedom is what Libero bequeaths to Essien.","popularity":0.1981,"poster_path":"/1eWRxAKLl2Y5ELior8uNsxzxjvm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Right to Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"丘の上の本屋さん","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"O Direito à Felicidade","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Remo Girone","original_name":"Remo Girone","popularity":0.3344,"profile_path":"/gRS90yn20ZMlq4pvVQjtUM5DLqN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6193dd1875f1ad008fdd33a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corrado Fortuna","original_name":"Corrado Fortuna","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/Ap0FrVoBHuYBIeENawqlS0V55uK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6193dd246ca9a00067303d82","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didie Lorenz Tchumbu","original_name":"Didie Lorenz Tchumbu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6193dd2a8258fc0094a9373e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moni Ovadia","original_name":"Moni Ovadia","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/oCWqzvHsHvv3o9bWVlziEFnXDjT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6193dd311ad93b0043d3de70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pino Calabrese","original_name":"Pino Calabrese","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/1NFAHS8cHsHvjCa667PsIteSbI3.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6193dd371ad93b00237c59e8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gianluca Gallucci","original_name":"Gianluca Gallucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193dd0175f1ad00431c6b34","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Davide Zucchetti","original_name":"Davide Zucchetti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193dd0d4581990064c7577c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Rossi Massimi","original_name":"Claudio Rossi Massimi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193dce27ad08c008f51dc40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Rossi Massimi","original_name":"Claudio Rossi Massimi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193dce875f1ad008fdd334b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2591683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucia Macale","original_name":"Lucia Macale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193dcf5ccb15f00661c8e56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13913738","wikidata_id":"Q110460333","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/1eWRxAKLl2Y5ELior8uNsxzxjvm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/vapa8Z7j8uWOD0yWpzk7qcLiVBp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1817}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
