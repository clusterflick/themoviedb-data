Harry and Farina notice a rivalry between two very large young kids, Joe and Chubby, that would fill the bill if only the two heavyweights would put aside their gentle natures. Farina gets an idea: tell each of the lads that the other will take a dive in the second round. So the fight begins and the stands are filled; but will the combatants actually throw a punch? Ernie has one more trick up his sleeve to get the fists flying and the crowd on its feet. Sweet science indeed.","popularity":0.5861,"poster_path":"/tAIeFWuyuNZZTzOJclPLCm64TOQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boxing Gloves","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Aber","original_name":"Johnny Aber","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Boy sitting to the right of the tomato thrower","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f382f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Chaney","original_name":"Norman Chaney","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/kt0X2khuZxy7lXavbXI3vjfr6LS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Chubby","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3833","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cobb","original_name":"Joe Cobb","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/1tbc8vvi0Rx8sIsxUSPLraiuchV.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3837","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Cooper","original_name":"Jackie Cooper","popularity":0.669,"profile_path":"/pbdUaMBfLq2qUP1jg7dM9hINRcI.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Jackie","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f383b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":949499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Darling","original_name":"Jean Darling","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":"/cdqmANXlclbuhSZrMj3Rw5sdhiY.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f383f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hall","original_name":"Charlie Hall","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/huLPhEhh8pO9v0gSJb7HVB76GRZ.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Sidewalk diner attendant","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3843","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen 'Farina' Hoskins","original_name":"Allen 'Farina' Hoskins","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/dpRqNv9R1k2YFVWaplHsBFNu086.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Farina","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3847","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby 'Wheezer' Hutchins","original_name":"Bobby 'Wheezer' Hutchins","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/fw0r5KTZb4A9fq3klG8GEiosaPt.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Wheezer","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f384b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1055292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Ann Jackson","original_name":"Mary Ann Jackson","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/9NMuWeHW8U9QtAAUEvvAmqxHjj.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Mary Ann","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f384f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Mallon","original_name":"Bobby Mallon","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Announcer Graham McCracker","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3853","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Schuler","original_name":"Billy Schuler","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3857","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Shuford","original_name":"Andy Shuford","popularity":0.1927,"profile_path":"/3q1vgTPfXpPcaJOo6JPJqpAzJRP.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Chubby's trainer","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f385b","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnie 'Beezer' Smith","original_name":"Donnie 'Beezer' Smith","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/d4OiwPtaKmScBdf6LHlJQO0H2Q0.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Beezer","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f385f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Spear","original_name":"Harry Spear","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/cai6t0K01PQ6ASlwc3WqdOmAmez.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3863","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dannie Mac Grant","original_name":"Dannie Mac Grant","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/AjAJbyKvKBi3p8Es149FLBHdhi2.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"(uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4b1fc3a36847f81f3867","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
