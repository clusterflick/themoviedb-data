Terry cleans houses for a living - but what she'd really like is a house of her own. Her husband Des is quite content to go on living in a caravan.  Terry spots an advertisement for 'The Buckingham', a low-budget project home. For Terri it's love at first sight but it isn't till she reveals the depth of her desperation that Des relents and sells his boat so they'll have enough for the deposit.  Excitedly they move to the outskirts of Sydney to begin their new life but they soon discover the dream can turn into a nightmare.","popularity":1.0569,"poster_path":"/oph1wAhrtXWpN7CRiPTalvBiwhf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palm Beach
