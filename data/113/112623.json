Creepy and beautiful at the same time, it does not share platitudinous ways to frighten the audience with the vast majority of modern horrors. Countess di Castiglione is a really existed Italian courtesan famous for her beauty and wide acquaintanceship among the ruling elite of those times. She directed Pierre-Louis Pierson to help her create 700 different photographs in which she re-created the signature moments of her life for the camera. Robert de Montesquiou, a Symbolist poet, dandy, and avid art collector, was fascinated by the Countess di Castiglione. He spent thirteen years writing a biography, La Divine Comtesse, which appeared in 1913. After her death, he collected 433 of her photographs, all of which entered the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.","popularity":0.4682,"poster_path":"/7bmgtExAFM2Ejqp37TC3knN11RU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Native Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La comtesse de Castiglione","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1009472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia García","original_name":"Virginia García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b1cc3a36847f81f2f49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":218114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Coggins","original_name":"Howard Coggins","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/cTwAjypEE1mXtcqHIhnNCUUHreV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b1cc3a36847f81f2f4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Marioni","original_name":"Ray Marioni","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66d357196e97953b05945415","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocky Byron","original_name":"Rocky Byron","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66d357358f265bb6e9b60ed5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lodge","original_name":"David Lodge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5565b951c3a3687ad900182e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106299,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Lodge","original_name":"David Lodge","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3563193a8774f24c0d703","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106299,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Lodge","original_name":"David Lodge","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3563fac52e3192fb17214","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915508,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antony Radcliffe","original_name":"Antony Radcliffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3566aac52e3192fb1721e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915509,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ibrahim Kazandjian","original_name":"Ibrahim Kazandjian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3569b9192cfbf71005283","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915510,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ian Chattam","original_name":"Ian Chattam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d356b34ced5c2c5f580fa6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4915509,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ibrahim Kazandjian","original_name":"Ibrahim Kazandjian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d356de34b4c444a3c0d70b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1238198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Miller","original_name":"Joel Miller","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d356fd4e0a1bf9a3ae0b2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93ydGz9WBvOrzgRb0lfWi1wJRgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7bmgtExAFM2Ejqp37TC3knN11RU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
