The protagonist of his story is Piotr ‘Mad' Korczak, while somewhere in the background there is his rival Andrzej Marcisz. The director focuses on the career decline of a great master, provoking his reflection on his future life, when he will no longer be able to climb mountains. A moving story about inability to come to terms with old age and the desire of immortality.","popularity":0.2103,"poster_path":"/yhNPtS59wxkBGJzF2Hk71mghsAI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2010-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Declaration of Immortality","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Korczak","original_name":"Piotr Korczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b1ac3a36847f81f2935","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrzej Marcisz","original_name":"Andrzej Marcisz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b1ac3a36847f81f2939","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Koszałka","original_name":"Marcin Koszałka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1ac3a36847f81f2945","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Koszałka","original_name":"Marcin Koszałka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1ac3a36847f81f294b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Koszałka","original_name":"Marcin Koszałka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1ac3a36847f81f293f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1055087,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Wagner","original_name":"Anna Wagner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1bc3a36847f81f295d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacek Kołtuniak","original_name":"Jacek Kołtuniak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1bc3a36847f81f2957","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055088,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryszard Urbaniak","original_name":"Ryszard Urbaniak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1bc3a36847f81f2963","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372458,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Piotr Michalski","original_name":"Piotr Michalski","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656fa3bb1cc4ff011e16196d","department":"Lighting","job":"Master Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055085,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrzej Smolik","original_name":"Andrzej Smolik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c740b7c3da0a8c6f409a1e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2117860","wikidata_id":"Q9205587","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":15.231,"height":26,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/n5kGc5lVeKIuVEIBiXtXlxK25Wz.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":396}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yhNPtS59wxkBGJzF2Hk71mghsAI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ulsan Ulju Mountain Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Film Trailer: Deklaracja nieśmiertelności / Declaration of Immortality","key":"te3LwzHUyxE","published_at":"2011-06-26T15:33:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e4c3a368544800893b"}]}}}
