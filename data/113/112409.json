After recording an album of songs by his friend Jobim, Frank Sinatra is reported to have said, \"I haven't sung so quietly since I had laryngitis.\" Naturally, \"The Girl from Ipanema\" and Frank Sinatra are featured in this musical collage of countless seamlessly edited excerpts of concert footage that cover decades of events all over the world: from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon, Paris, Copenhagen, Jerusalem, Tokyo, Montreal, New York and back to Rio.","popularity":0.2206,"poster_path":"/8k5CIDgKcZwfde0Xo28d8wyeGje.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Natura","origin_country":""},{"id":76566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regina
