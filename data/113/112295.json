(So, what's your price?), it seems to be the constant over this excellent documentary work, performed by Olallo Rubio, a young Mexican director. The movie shows two faces of the same issue: the American influence in the Mexican culture. you will remain thinking after the movie ends. Everything has a price? Everybody has a price?, so, What's your price?. Strong and ancient differences between two distant-neighbor countries are discussed under each opinion. Both Mexican and American-common persons give its particular point of view about the other, but also about themselves. Developed with a extremely low budget, but with inventive and imagination, this movie shows many of the key aspects in the Mexican-American relationship. However, the movie is not just a compilation of statistics, the producers manage to make it fun too. That's one of it's good points. But never the only one. Well developed, absolutely recommendable.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/kdjbqn7v8oSTvFbOoTEqbtGOkcA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2007-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So, What's Your Price?","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"So, What's Your Price?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olallo Rubio","original_name":"Olallo Rubio","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/rcBLf47zmQasZGEE4koiDcffzYE.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b14c3a36847f81f1471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1020853","wikidata_id":"Q5576178","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kdjbqn7v8oSTvFbOoTEqbtGOkcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
