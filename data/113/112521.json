Although he is a top agent, he is questioning his loyalty after twenty years of service. His devotion has already cost him his wife, family and personal life. During a de-briefing from his last assignment, he is unknowingly administered the drug Oblivion, which destroys brain cells causing permanent memory loss. Within a few days of injection, the drug's effects become irreversible. Clayton will not only lose his memory, he will lose his identity as well. He realizes he can no longer rely on anyone at the agency to help him, not even his boss, Agent LaNova. With nowhere left to go, he appeals to his ex-wife, Kate, for help. Clayton and Kate must locate the antidote before it's too late.","popularity":1.9362,"poster_path":"/xMXNAUtRXwyCwmP1EnWCqeK1nRa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35,"logo_path":"/wxrHa3nZ1K4zo65p56991INkGo6.png","name":"Lions Gate Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10399,"logo_path":null,"name":"CineTel Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Lapse","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Sulle tracce del passato","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William McNamara","original_name":"William McNamara","popularity":0.7906,"profile_path":"/hVOdM3UUmJqpREnBxzm0J4j0b5R.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clayton Pirce","credit_id":"53a346070e0a26149200064f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Meyer","original_name":"Dina Meyer","popularity":3.2106,"profile_path":"/bKte4cIXI1aQat8JLVNONZE4Y2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"53a345fe0e0a26148f000669","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Scheider","original_name":"Roy Scheider","popularity":1.0136,"profile_path":"/y0MTwkCm5fIKjM1xH90tZbjAHql.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Agent La Nova","credit_id":"52fe4b1ac3a36847f81f285b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Rollins","original_name":"Henry Rollins","popularity":0.8415,"profile_path":"/2E0cZdoJsdt1Lv4waG3s6fsfJeU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gaines","credit_id":"53a346100e0a2614a800062c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":196358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Lynch","original_name":"Barry Lynch","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/n0y9euSOCwkSv99y7M4xv58Gifc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"53a3461c0e0a261492000652","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adoni Maropis","original_name":"Adoni Maropis","popularity":0.3382,"profile_path":"/eMT9AihEqmnJdAqIqWvsWm590mn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Iraqi Leader","credit_id":"53a346250e0a26149e0006b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Endre Hules","original_name":"Endre Hules","popularity":0.3257,"profile_path":"/nIAnouBLmT2kbYA7fs9R8ix9I50.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rossovitch","credit_id":"53a3462e0e0a2614990006f6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":206493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassandra Hepburn","original_name":"Cassandra Hepburn","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":"/myKQClzs2wygDFfTWSZ132gtNpS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Susan Li","credit_id":"53a346380e0a2614a8000633","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haskell V.
