Beginners Workout: The beginners workout is quite energetic and he literally launches right into the routine. There's lots of kicking and punching (very good fun). This workout last's roughly 30 - 35 mins.  Experienced Workout (I don't think it's actually called that, but I can't remember the wording!!).
