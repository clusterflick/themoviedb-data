The only disappointing section is the final cooldown. It's not as fun as the rest, and the addition of abs and glutes might complete the fitness aspect but doesn't gel with the rest of the up-beat funky workout. Not for serious fitness fanatics but undeniably fun--and it'll do wonders for your dance-floor cred.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/QOGfe0y1zTkxtb9UIecCvDNVmu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dan Karaty - The Hotpants Workout","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/QOGfe0y1zTkxtb9UIecCvDNVmu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
