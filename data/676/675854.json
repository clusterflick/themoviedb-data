In \"The Practice of Architecture\", critic Kenneth Frampton visits Zumthor at his studio where the two are surrounded by models, designs and plans for current and future projects throughout Europe and the United States. Frampton questions the renowned architecture on the motives and methods behind some of his most famous works, including his Zinc-Mine-Museum in Norway and the highly acclaimed Therme Vals, a stunning hotel and spa built over the thermal springs in Graubünden. While walking us through his career, Zumthor discusses his penchant for minimalism, the importance of landscape, light and material, and the architectural theory behind his stunningly precise style","popularity":0.2025,"poster_path":"/xssdygrVx5VhbrY7wukPAnOXC6W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Practice of Architecture: Visiting Peter Zumthor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Frampton","original_name":"Kenneth Frampton","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e517c8df48b3400136ebec5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rima Yamazaki","original_name":"Rima Yamazaki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e517c78f48b3400176ebe23","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5e517c5ca76ac50016a2bc9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joëlle Schon","original_name":"Joëlle Schon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e517c8135811d001354d38c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5e517c6ff48b3400136ebea1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2823030","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ekNGqRgIwnopEIwsbzc6MICXUCh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xV6MreglnV3gAgCyJAkC7yZLabN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cdSmDpVusqEzFQaifeUVJlu5con.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iJ8kYMD7JenPrP7hg5jpxLHrIeU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pFcZ0PHZggeTESoRrMAXwiur5l6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d6QQtx8JJnSwKtngrqtLiStK06C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2SEr3e1SYadQ1OosUDC5hQ1uLax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/14ohoCL6gMDdvUj1pWfvFsVjDaQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xssdygrVx5VhbrY7wukPAnOXC6W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5VknjwEpColr45XKII1aTWoNyyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Architecture Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
