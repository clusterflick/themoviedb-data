She returns to her father, a gamekeeper at the castle of Count Franz, a despotic bachelor whose brothers Lazlos and Michael covet his estate. Disheartened by her shattered romance, Anna accepts the proposal of Franz. The brothers conspire to hire Paul to compromise the girl, but Paul, discovering she is none other than the woman he loves, decides to win her for himself.
