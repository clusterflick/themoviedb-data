Today, as a radical Ultra-Orthodox leader, he organizes mass demonstrations against the State of Israel. He is also the editor of an influential magazine of a radical Jewish sect known for not recognizing the State of Israel. In contrast, Ultra-Orthodox parliament member, Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, served in the Israeli Army, and has been involved in mainstream politics for many years. As national election day approaches, Ravitz anxiously tallies his party's projected parliament seats. Conversely, Pappenhym is counting on high numbers of voter abstentions. For Pappenhym, participation in Zionist elections is a grave sin.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/5iKxZJ9ljZSQpj3iLtddTzIINxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2010-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A rare journey to the heart of an ultra-Orthodox community in Israel","title":"HAREDIM - Gevald!","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"!גיוואלד","type":"Original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmuel-Haim Pappenhym","original_name":"Shmuel-Haim Pappenhym","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4f81909b861600166bb896","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avraham Ravitz","original_name":"Avraham Ravitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4f81aa9b861600166bb8c5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Ofer","original_name":"Ron Ofer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f811da93d250015452dd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yohai Hakak","original_name":"Yohai Hakak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f812a9b861600166bb847","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Itay Ken-Tor","original_name":"Itay Ken-Tor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f814da76ac500159f8189","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/5iKxZJ9ljZSQpj3iLtddTzIINxJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
