It narrates the search for a lost paradise. From the moment that Europeans crossed the Atlantic, it became the anima of a resistance discourse.  How many different weapons does it take for a fight? The solo exhibition of Patrícia Ferreira Pará Yxapy, one of the most engaged women among Brazil’s Indigenous filmmakers combines new works and the archive behind her audiovisual journey over the past 15 years, always in close collaboration with the Mbyá-Guarani Cinema Collective.
