Their house lies on the border; the façade is under Israeli occupation, the Palestinian Authority controls the back. At the entrance to the house is a military post; on the roof the Israeli army has placed a watch point over Palestinian Hebron. The three women, trapped in the middle and constantly surrounded by Israeli soldiers, carry on their difficult lives in a perverse situation: the occupation becomes a routine, the absurd becomes a given. This is the story of an occupation that extends to the staircase and the roof of the house, where it encounters poverty, loneliness, pain, but also the small joys of everyday life. This is an internal prison, the external one is the ongoing occupation.","popularity":0.2911,"poster_path":"/smimsQXQtmHR8AQpfCj7AGfNf1B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2001-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detained","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Eingeschlossen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Asurot","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Asurot (Detained)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Setton","original_name":"Dan Setton","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3463f950a64219eb1736f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568402,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Danor Glazer","original_name":"Danor Glazer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3461bd4d215b280580f09","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234814,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oron Adar","original_name":"Oron Adar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d3462f0909699461b60b89","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2546995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anat Even","original_name":"anat even","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e518984f48b3400156eeac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1483398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ada Ushpiz","original_name":"עדה אושפיז","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e51899635811d001955d691","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321310","wikidata_id":"Q1307512","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/smimsQXQtmHR8AQpfCj7AGfNf1B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":173259,"name":"arab"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK.fest München","release_date":"2005-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
