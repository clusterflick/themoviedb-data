The movement was initially videoed with a phone, the sound recorded on a good deck.  The video was then analyzed carefully frame by frame, and converted to a movement score that was then performed by a dancer and a homemade camera.  In this process it becomes something other, refracted through multiple layers of interpretation, its calm insistence full of a sense of meaning that finally passes without ever having revealed more than the enigmatic gesture itself.  Shot with a homemade pinhole camera onto homemade emulsion.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/nxewILxWWIZLTynW9MbuXke16qz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Schaller","original_name":"Robert Schaller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e51feb135811d001555e5fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539092,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Christensen","original_name":"Simon Christensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e51fec1a76ac50013a3ae25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nxewILxWWIZLTynW9MbuXke16qz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://vimeo.com/374383810?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=4335317","release_date":"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
