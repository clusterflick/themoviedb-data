A world inhabited by exceptional beings who have the capacity to experience joy from a single musical note. Individuals who partake in remarkable efforts to unveil that dream of beauty which preoccupies each and every one of them. You may notice them singing anywhere and everywhere: at the wheel, in the shower, even in the kitchen. But above all, they sing together, men and women of all ages and various backgrounds, transformed by the radiant glory of song, and united under the banner of L'Ensemble vocal d'Outremont. Music is at the centre of their universe and gives them the intense feeling of belonging to the human race. Especially as the big night approaches and the collective dream of perfect harmony is but a breath away.","popularity":0.0599,"poster_path":"/y3svzihlIw0RaaerfcN8WDbsnDG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For a Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Leduc","original_name":"Jacques Leduc","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/loS8GxqZmGvpB8JXyiOx45pSlCe.jpg","credit_id":"61b1e5e5da9ef2001d3698f3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195873,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"André Corriveau","original_name":"André Corriveau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b1e5fd5800c4005f0ce53c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Gagliardi","original_name":"Laurent Gagliardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e50420aeb0932001241514c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2338265,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karina Goma","original_name":"Karina Goma","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e50421d35811d001352de51","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tahani Rached","original_name":"Tahani Rached","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qXPkbtXLRjaZqmaFTj2V7lYyFDE.jpg","credit_id":"5e5041edb3e627001426ac13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0357341","wikidata_id":"Q56419171","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y3svzihlIw0RaaerfcN8WDbsnDG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
