The film unfolds across multiple universes wherein dreams are recycled waste products and meaning has been all but lost. The narrator arms himself with artificial memories of artificial pasts in order to protect himself from the future. SHADOWBANNED is a meditation on the perception of history, esoteric culture and the implosion of meaning in our hyper-accelerated times.","popularity":0.1166,"poster_path":"/ygkh5tSVJxs4zx5TnLAKr4OapH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SHADOWBANNED","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Rafman","original_name":"Jon Rafman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/5ouiqddcOWIAyReiu4aLwi2dSkf.jpg","credit_id":"5e518107f48b3400136ec9e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1264,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ygkh5tSVJxs4zx5TnLAKr4OapH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
