Until then he did not spare his characters death and transience, and when the time came he directed a childishly inquisitive view on his own inevitable ending. He did it with a small miniDV camera and in a matter of seconds turned from a professional filmmaker to an amateur who films not only when he can and when the conditions are favorable, but always and everywhere because he feels a need to express himself through film and think in terms of film. At the end of his five decades long career, Babaja had the modesty and the inspiration to start again. As an 80-year-old he made his first feature-length documentary film, using digital technology for the first time. Good Morning impressively and consistently rounds up the artistic and life trajectory of a great modernist and paints a unique authorial trace he left in the history of our cinema.","popularity":0.0701,"poster_path":"/6JBLAR2jB2mnsVfJc2TwGivviuo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sava","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2007-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Morning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ante Babaja","original_name":"Ante Babaja","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e581fe3f48b34001579bdf8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433579,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Goran Trbuljak","original_name":"Goran Trbuljak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e4e33a880551002d0ba69e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ante Babaja","original_name":"Ante Babaja","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5055c49b861600186d579f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546207,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tomislav Jagec","original_name":"Tomislav Jagec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5055fceb093200164160e5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ante Babaja","original_name":"Ante Babaja","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5055dc35811d0017541bd6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ante Babaja","original_name":"Ante Babaja","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e58204f0398ab0012a18f3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1050696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6JBLAR2jB2mnsVfJc2TwGivviuo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
