Even though Rosaura is wanted by the fisherman José, she rejects him. Pedro, a horseman, arrives at her place and begins to harass María until he manages to possess her. The man is a criminal who usually cheats with fishermen and hurts those who dare to confront him with his ax. When the evildoer tries to abuse Rosaura, José, the fisherman, does what is necessary to avenge the insult. Furthermore, other men are already looking for Pedro.","popularity":0.3088,"poster_path":"/1Jpiyfx8XiuGAIvOPoEvQxeSHEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1959-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thirst for Love","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Armendáriz","original_name":"Pedro Armendáriz","popularity":0.592,"profile_path":"/c9WueBsUgQDmCSIOxTeyhG7RUwB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pedro Ortiz","credit_id":"5efc02807b7b4d0036559470","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvana Pampanini","original_name":"Silvana Pampanini","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/8WvSvjToM53gtqklWJ2c1MOHYVZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"5efc028c5437f500388ec334","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Luisa Peluffo","original_name":"Ana Luisa Peluffo","popularity":0.2943,"profile_path":"/70TzTJgZmwYAJCHWyLt3l69LpRs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rosaura","credit_id":"5efc029ad6d64d0035c6dd16","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Fernández","original_name":"Jaime Fernández","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/i3EP5OlYcVkIX6YJG2Lhwngp4Jo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"José","credit_id":"5efc02ab7b7b4d0038565db3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Manzano","original_name":"Miguel Manzano","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/b38NBptTzji4Jh51gD8esmGiup0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Señor Cura","credit_id":"5efc02b8a284eb0038970941","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":380715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Roldán","original_name":"Emma Roldán","popularity":0.1784,"profile_path":"/yDXKuZZKy6UTAmb1HyUKs6pLnlx.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Abuela","credit_id":"5efc02c3be7f350033a8b17d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Varela","original_name":"Alfredo Varela","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/bL9pYkkvzQG44QCoLmDuMo13EFx.jpg","credit_id":"5efc0263f031740036508560","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112022,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José María Fernández Unsáin","original_name":"José María Fernández Unsáin","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/qykIys8fB5BeDY6B7VESRmEMwLJ.jpg","credit_id":"5efc0212e93e950035be7f14","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sergio Magaña Hidalgo","original_name":"Sergio Magaña Hidalgo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efc0226f03174003650846f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfonso Corona Blake","original_name":"Alfonso Corona Blake","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":"/6tGpy6DqlAmMoS4OelUEx3nME2k.jpg","credit_id":"5efc01f57b7b4d003556f93d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0134956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1Jpiyfx8XiuGAIvOPoEvQxeSHEe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1959-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
