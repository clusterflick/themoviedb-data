The motifs and colors of his canvasses have been widely reproduced, and are now part of the 20th century art pantheon, changing the way we view the world. Hockney is typically seen as an artist who loves life, a good time, glamour and sex. The highly personal and emotional side of his work is often overlooked, much like the intensity and individuality he has shown in each of his successive periods and styles. Through images, anecdotes, and detailed pictorial analysis, this documentary highlights how the renowned painter defies classification and remains mysterious in many ways: an intense, profound, and infinitely passionate artist.","popularity":0.4591,"poster_path":"/7R1pCW973fBEQeZ6UPR7zygO2CU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101459,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prounen Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Hockney: Time Reclaimed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"David Hockney: Från poolen till porträtten","type":"TV Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"David Hockney - L'eternità ritrovata","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hockney","original_name":"David Hockney","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/mUPzSASAKnpR9FjkUXz7LcOfKv5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4f1f219a3c49001237ee6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Rotschopf","original_name":"Michael Rotschopf","popularity":0.2869,"profile_path":"/2hDYo2hlzrecWg33DXL7BGq0IV9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sprecher (voice)","credit_id":"5e4f1f5aa76ac500169ebfe8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1986436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Trabitzsch","original_name":"Michael Trabitzsch","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f1ea09b861600116bc95f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1986436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Trabitzsch","original_name":"Michael Trabitzsch","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f1e92a76ac500139ef1c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545373,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Frefat","original_name":"Robert Frefat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f1eaf9a3c490014384a6e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11718074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9Ph3cjyukyCAEkM1zseBe4gno1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7R1pCW973fBEQeZ6UPR7zygO2CU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":228469,"name":"paint"},{"id":262449,"name":"british painter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Arte","release_date":"2017-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
