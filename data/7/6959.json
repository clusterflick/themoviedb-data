Strangely, every time she steals something, a mysterious man pays for it. A clumsy detective begins investigating and finds a crucial clue: a strongly scented woman's glove. The perfume is an expensive scent and the detective's pal realizes that it belongs to a popular nightclub singer. The friend quickly becomes enamored of the girl, but then so does her mystery man, a notorious international criminal. Eventually he gets arrested, leaving the detective's pal to move in on the singer.","popularity":0.6217,"poster_path":"/ecV51geUk4YuM1jqOi5T24j27PC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Super-Film
