All of them plunder their parents' supplies in order to build their own stage and amplifiers. Baffled by these unexplained thefts, the parents decide to hold a meeting as their suspicions turn to a group of camper folks living across from their flat. The tables are turned when the residents take a camping holiday of their own and end up being mistrusted by the locals as much as they themselves did their own neighbors. Meanwhile, the children's gang meets a rival group of kids who are planning to enter the same competition.","popularity":0.5299,"poster_path":"/torzyhBq9j6FuGJ4XBlcNb7cD4K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castor Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1980-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gang Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harro Coppens","original_name":"Harro Coppens","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Erik Verginkel","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bart Gabriëlse","original_name":"Bart Gabriëlse","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":"/mai3LHB3W9TJmZYdMzsYTFDUuSB.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Maarten Verginkel","credit_id":"64d4e961b6c26411575225f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick van Doorn","original_name":"Patrick van Doorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bennie","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liesbeth Hovius","original_name":"Liesbeth Hovius","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Reene Klein","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Mulder","original_name":"Ingrid Mulder","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Anja","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b17","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Rook","original_name":"Robert Rook","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Willem","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b1b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norbert van der Zwaan","original_name":"Norbert van der Zwaan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ronny Jansen","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b1f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Femke van der Linden","original_name":"Femke van der Linden","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Karin","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b23","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Oomes","original_name":"Joyce Oomes","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Astrid","credit_id":"52fe446ec3a36847f8095b27","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Cox","original_name":"Gerard Cox","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/s1tOcwZQHHlZwH9jFlK14vKmbJa.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Dhr.
