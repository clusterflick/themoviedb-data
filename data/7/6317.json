A stranger comes to the house - Ruth's cousin - with a picture of Ruth, age 8, in Berlin, with a woman the cousin says helped Ruth escape. Hannah, Ruth's daughter engaged to a gentile, goes to Berlin to find the woman, Lena Fisher, now 90. Posing as a journalist investigating intermarriage, Hannah interviews Lena who tells the story of a week in 1943 when the Jewish husbands of Aryan women were detained in a building on Rosenstrasse. The women gather daily for word of their husbands. The film goes back and forth to tell Ruth and Lena's story. How will it affect Hannah?","popularity":1.256,"poster_path":"/whHyCV08F1C2r7uzTeyHsJ4nIWg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2538,"logo_path":"/yWB5nl8uOhLTwKOqMpkGjfv0FIW.png","name":"Letterbox Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1469,"logo_path":"/AwbErjR0AMpVnN9PbdHiBB3g3q0.png","name":"Tele München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2003-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosenstrasse","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":41,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Riemann","original_name":"Katja Riemann","popularity":0.3653,"profile_path":"/waayy0jpNbxLDQ8JO1uRDng8SLF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lena Fischer ( 33 Jahre alt )","credit_id":"52fe444ac3a36847f808d893","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Schrader","original_name":"Maria Schrader","popularity":0.2389,"profile_path":"/sZuIcKq5D75GNKlYecK08O3X0hG.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hannah Weinstein","credit_id":"52fe444ac3a36847f808d897","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Schade","original_name":"Doris Schade","popularity":0.2309,"profile_path":"/aFhyDdmrd3jJJ0TI64uO0cUWCXP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lena Fischer ( 90 Jahre alt )","credit_id":"52fe444ac3a36847f808d89b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jutta Lampe","original_name":"Jutta Lampe","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":"/3N5QHA58w6d4iYGenNC8OWdWlWH.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ruth Weinstein ( 60 Jahre alt )","credit_id":"52fe444ac3a36847f808d89f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svea Lohde","original_name":"Svea Lohde","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Ruth Weinstein ( 8.
