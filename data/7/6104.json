And it’s not an entirely sad occasion. “That wretched little man,” she says. “He’s always been so much trouble. How is it Miss Marple has never upset me at all, not ever?” That night, who should appear at her doorstep but the wretched little man himself, Hercule Poirot? The great fictional detective and his creator proceed to play a very Christie-like game of cat and mouse for the manuscript – and for their own lives.","popularity":1.0608,"poster_path":"/4k8u5rro0RyF2skYlYcyBFnWbSa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder by the Book","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Ashcroft","original_name":"Peggy Ashcroft","popularity":0.1774,"profile_path":"/bF2GD1brYDKT17j25ANkZQR739R.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Agatha Christie","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Holm","original_name":"Ian Holm","popularity":1.4643,"profile_path":"/9YbuYOqOmYwReBAj9Hh6z7DWwhH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hercule Poirot","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wilson","original_name":"Richard Wilson","popularity":0.9716,"profile_path":"/e0W6gWfmNOTiHPmxGWyjsQTrUHF.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sir Max Mallowan","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Aldridge","original_name":"Michael Aldridge","popularity":0.288,"profile_path":"/2qd9sF9MKhrNXDlwoHGWYn7i3gr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Edmond Cork","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Atkinson","original_name":"John Atkinson","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gardener","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn Archibald","original_name":"Dawn Archibald","popularity":0.149,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4e7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Gordon Clark","original_name":"Lawrence Gordon Clark","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":"/kIw4PQjseVY5VSuCADgNYXYGimN.jpg","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Evans","original_name":"Nick Evans","popularity":0.0994,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4ab","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47871,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dickie Bamber","original_name":"Dickie Bamber","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Goodall","original_name":"Howard Goodall","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/8uWVPa2mwX4neQj26i2fPrO5DDI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4bd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47872,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Jessop","original_name":"Peter Jessop","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13321,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Box","original_name":"John Box","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe443dc3a36847f808a4cf","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2173277,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Price","original_name":"John Price","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be8481cc3a368174e027806","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0201788","wikidata_id":"Q17635437","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4k8u5rro0RyF2skYlYcyBFnWbSa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":703,"name":"detective"},{"id":207046,"name":"murder mystery"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
