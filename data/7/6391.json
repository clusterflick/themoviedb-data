Batya, a catering waitress, takes in a young child apparently abandoned at a local beach. Batya is one of the servers at the wedding reception of Keren, a young bride who breaks her leg in trying to escape from a locked toilet stall, which ruins her chance at a romantic honeymoon in the Caribbean. One of the guests is Joy, a Philippine chore woman attending the event with her employer, and who doesn't speak any Hebrew (she communicates mainly in English), and who is guilt-ridden after having left her young son behind in the Philippines.","popularity":0.5069,"poster_path":"/hTCagyFazmGez993bLX9XgG3GiP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2426,"logo_path":"/ebQiHrVpqSs93D3A6eEDy9OFO52.png","name":"Les Films du
