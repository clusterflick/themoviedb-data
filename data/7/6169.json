However, she does not look forward to much, as her agent David hired journalist Eike Blohm to write Sophie's biography. But soon the idiosyncratic woman falls in love with her sensitive biographers. David, however, is not at all thrilled with Sophie's love affair: he fears that this could expose his scams and embezzlement of Sophie's private assets.","popularity":0.5061,"poster_path":"/oNaJTpiYjGxYXphRRkO1Nl11QaX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mit
