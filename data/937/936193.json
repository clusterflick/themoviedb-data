The narration centers on a young woman's struggle to find a relation between her body and her self as mediated by language. The text is a poetry of formal relations that carries personal and historical implications, including the desires of the woman paradoxically voiced by a male narrator. The title suggests the vivid virtuality of dreaming; scenes repeatedly refer to both reading and sleeping.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/x02xOSWdoiXNeD4U8HdEpcevtF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Body Travel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Foreman","original_name":"Richard Foreman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62020b8396670e008f846bfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x02xOSWdoiXNeD4U8HdEpcevtF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":624}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
