Directed by Paora Maxwell, it is framed around interviews with key figures (Syd Jackson, Hone Harawira, Ken Mair, Mike Smith, Annette Sykes, Eva Rickard, Joe Hawke). The interviewees explore events, and the kaupapa behind their activism, from thoughts on sovereignty, and the Treaty of Waitangi, through to symbolism (tree felling, land marches) and being kaitiaki of the environment.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radicals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3418525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paora Maxwell","original_name":"Paora Maxwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6202e37e9affc0008e22ce00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3418528,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray Waru","original_name":"Ray Waru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6202e396ffd44d0042054401","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
