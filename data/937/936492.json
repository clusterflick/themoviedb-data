These were taken on my phone during permitted exercise (cycling).  The shots from 26 March are “imitated”. On the alto saxophone I have recreated and recorded as many as possible of the original sounds from the (poor-quality) audio on my phone-shots, and thus replaced the original audio.\r The shots from 28 March replace the original audio, too, but are “inverted”. I wanted to make a soundtrack that was in some definable way the OPPOSITE of the actual sounds recorded on my phone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London 26 and 28 March 2020: Imitation: Inversion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3418746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Kraabel","original_name":"Caroline Kraabel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62031be95e12000097602b82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
