Fudge isn’t just a problem; he is a tornado, a tsunami, a superstorm, an arctic bomb of chaos and destruction. When Fudge runs away under Peter’s watch, an epic family adventure across New York City ensues, one that ultimately brings these two together just as their world is turned upside down by the arrival of a brand-new problem — an infant baby sister — reminding us all that nothing is ever constant … except change.","popularity":0.2877,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106544,"logo_path":"/psd84iF7PTGrKf4yFOStKj8JbAh.png","name":"AGBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","title":"SuperFudge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2425606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amos Vernon","original_name":"Amos Vernon","popularity":0.0824,"profile_path":"/qljP9V61X8jrgdNazFrDZJGLBbA.jpg","credit_id":"6201765d5a5ed00042e948cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3417154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nunio Randazzo","original_name":"Nunio Randazzo","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620176685a5ed000d16ae292","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Russo","original_name":"Joe Russo","popularity":0.8473,"profile_path":"/o0OXjFzL10jCy89iAs7UzzSbyoK.jpg","credit_id":"66993a49918faf64ba754d49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Russo","original_name":"Anthony Russo","popularity":1.0856,"profile_path":"/xbINBnWn28YygYWUJ1aSAw0xPRv.jpg","credit_id":"66993a550f81bafb5d1a4889","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170416,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Judy Blume","original_name":"Judy Blume","popularity":0.1853,"profile_path":"/IfncQ93lOOnY73UNxWAzmWxxwN.jpg","credit_id":"669939c73a064149edf45a2a","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18071584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
