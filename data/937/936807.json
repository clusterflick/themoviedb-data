Beginning with a single repeating shot of a fluorescent light, the film employs different methods of superimposition, juxtaposing 35mm still photographs of industrial architecture and the original Super 8 footage shot in Detroit. The soundtrack was produced using a Sony handheld microcassette recorder to capture field recordings of street construction throughout the city’s Midtown area. The process through which film and sound are recorded are integral to the final composition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8LD5MfM6BrTXpIFpscWlYGEZ3Xu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Station II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3419931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Hubbard","original_name":"Michael Hubbard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620436d319418600420c20cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LD5MfM6BrTXpIFpscWlYGEZ3Xu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVhl8en2PKbsgqBUv21q1PGbHHy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Media City Film Festival (virtual)","release_date":"2022-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
