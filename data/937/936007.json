The professor telephones to the husband to meet him and is about to shoot when the husband, in a small table mirror, sees the action and wheels on the music teacher. In the struggle, the professor is killed, but before dying he gives the husband his wife's note. The husband is arrested for the murder, but for the sake of their little daughter, hides the note in a secret drawer of his desk and keeps silent about his wife's connection with the slaying. Fifteen years later he is pardoned, but his wife orders him from the old home. He gets the note and when he shows it to the wife, she craves his forgiveness.","popularity":0.2441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suppressed Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
