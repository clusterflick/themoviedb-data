Each loop is exposed in one moment with 59 pinhole \"lenses\" to create as many distinct images that, when presented in series, create a panning of the landscape in various directions. The work was exposed on outdated black & white 35mm print stock acquired from Archives Canada discards, and processed by hand in Caffenol chemistry, a less environmentally impactful developer made with coffee, vitamin C and washing soda.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/j0kqSqIOZHCnsaDjOXwUWy3Ide6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pinhole Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2349394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex MacKenzie","original_name":"Alex MacKenzie","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8Pa5QCZyq2Gc7CXTIObpULLQ0Vl.jpg","credit_id":"62028b1e439be17b32a14981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0kqSqIOZHCnsaDjOXwUWy3Ide6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
