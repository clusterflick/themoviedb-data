The Den-O characters are drawn in the style of Shin-chan's regular characters.  Another thing of note, inbetween commercial breaks, clips of a live action Shin-Chan onboard the Den-Liner or with characters from the Kamen Rider Den-O Series were shown. In most of these scenes it involves the Owner giving Shin a speech of sorts or making Shin feel uncomfortable.","popularity":1.4656,"poster_path":"/fcIfJbJhh85FYUIAH4NSJNamXMN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crayon Shin-chan Midsummer Night: I Have Arrived!
