Our hero's day gets spookier by the second, as he is pelted with Purple Puffy Puffin' Lillies, startled by little lost Muckachuck Scouts, and survives a nose-to-nose encounter with a towering \"tree beast\"!  The Pobertanian Bean Wars:  When Bobbin receives a pair of Pobertainan Flamenco Beans in the mail, the gang just can't wait to see them dance. But these beans are in no mood to make merry. In fact, they are furious with each other! Join the Threads pals as they find out the cause of the commotion, and try to help patch up the predicament. Can the bean brothers bury their beefs and be buddies again? Bobbin and company learn about the Boxed Bean Business and also, just how important it is to forgive one another.","popularity":0.3602,"poster_path":"/lBAJ3u5tD3sxPkx7OQzh2SdGbei.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Word Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":219331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Everland Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Threads: Things That Go Puff in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millie Hurley","original_name":"Millie Hurley","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/dtXcNfTi625uqAGBO1usoDdsZ8L.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bobbin the Bear, Joan, Tiffany, Beanita","credit_id":"6201a80ae8d0b400b5fdfc79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Whalen","original_name":"Greg Whalen","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Patches the Pony, Beanardo, Beanello, Beanali","credit_id":"6201a8358f26bc010a7b6c60","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Gladd","original_name":"Alexis Gladd","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lacey the Lamb","credit_id":"6201a848af2da800ce3fb88c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Decker","original_name":"Andy Decker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rags the Rabbit","credit_id":"6201a855e54d5d0095738f10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krissy Shields","original_name":"Krissy Shields","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Christina","credit_id":"6201a864d37197009677b774","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Olsen","original_name":"Chris Olsen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/bQsKinztswcP00fNU2JT2SDMl7B.jpg","credit_id":"6201a890761421001b981de0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Olsen","original_name":"Chris Olsen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/bQsKinztswcP00fNU2JT2SDMl7B.jpg","credit_id":"6201a880e54d5d006bc1b8e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Olsen","original_name":"Chris Olsen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/bQsKinztswcP00fNU2JT2SDMl7B.jpg","credit_id":"65e55960a672540162aa351d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Olsen","original_name":"Chris Olsen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/bQsKinztswcP00fNU2JT2SDMl7B.jpg","credit_id":"65e55898278d8a0147bdfb12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erik Hanson","original_name":"Erik Hanson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e55929278d8a0185c2952f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loren Balman","original_name":"Loren Balman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e558a4a672540162aa3390","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571554,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rich S.
