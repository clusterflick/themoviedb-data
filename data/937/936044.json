A fire breaks out among the booths and everyone is pulled to safety except little Peggy, Marjorie's kid sister. Marjorie pleads with Kirk to save the child, but he lacks the courage, and Randolph Sherman, Kirk's rival for Marjorie's affections, plays the hero part. For Kirk's public display of cowardice, he is disowned by his father and rejected by Marjorie, who soon marries Sherman. Kirk drifts to the South Seas, eventually landing in Manila, where he becomes a derelict. When Lillie, a fellow drifter, is roughly handled in a bar, Kirk goes to her assistance; she expresses appreciation for his bravery and soon effects his regeneration through her faith in him. Kirk and Lillie journey to the interior, and they obtain work on a plantation recently purchased by Randolph Sherman. During a native uprising, Sherman is killed, and Kirk saves Marjorie from certain death.","popularity":0.2657,"poster_path":"/A3c3nYJbxjH64HWiCXOtZ32HpPx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ports of Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Lowe","original_name":"Edmund Lowe","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/8aDjzC5moz2NQZ8aBhBn5bmuFXj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kirk Rainnsford","credit_id":"62016ebacf4b8b00b771ccc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Keener","original_name":"Hazel Keener","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/yCdeKDDHVvpDOB3uF8DM1Fqj95q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marjorie Vail","credit_id":"62016ec81e922500df6006cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William B.
