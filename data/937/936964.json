The company he is a part of is rehearsing a comedy. Double also has a special power: the power of invisibility. Thanks to this ability, he spends all his free time following others, coming into contact with the less visible sides of their lives and their personalities. He follows his fellow actors and spies on the customers of the hotel where he works. Except for theater and hotel work, Double has no social life, nor does he have friends. One evening, he uses his invisibility power to attend the theater rehearsals. When the actors begin to rehearse the scene, what happens leaves him bewildered: played from start to finish, without his parts, the scene works just as well. Double comes out lost and disoriented. Was it perhaps the answer he was looking for? He ends up staying invisible and completely withdrawing from his own life.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3420431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Valente","original_name":"Valerio Valente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62049bc790b87e00d1c1882e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"SF Indie Festival","release_date":"2022-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
