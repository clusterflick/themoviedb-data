During a time of suppression, she is exiled with her brother to Siberia. There Petroff is sent in the discharge of his official duties and secretly renews their romance. When the Bolsheviki overthrow the government, Sonia is freed and aids in the escape of Petroff, who incurs the enmity of Egor, the revolutionary leader, because he is a royalist. Together they escape across the frozen wastes in a sledge, pursued by wolves and Egor, who has used patriotism as a cloak to conceal personal ambitions.","popularity":0.2533,"poster_path":"/ouW4YVSSvy4vIhiSfuPsDHWtzEJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shows the horrors of the Siberian salt mines, the mutiny of political exiles and love and romance that triumphed despite oppression.","title":"Siberia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Rubens","original_name":"Alma Rubens","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5E4uO4iO6cw0FsOL2oUcytqM1XN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sonia Vronsky","credit_id":"62019bde1b70ae00faa222bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Lowe","original_name":"Edmund Lowe","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/8aDjzC5moz2NQZ8aBhBn5bmuFXj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leonid Petroff","credit_id":"62019beb8f26bc0043d95de7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Tellegen","original_name":"Lou Tellegen","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/ztroYjioXrzZAlTXWGoUN8Ak3Fz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Egor Kaplan","credit_id":"62019bf99d592c001b8e4a23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Alexis Vetkin","credit_id":"62019c1213654500682929b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Panzer","original_name":"Paul Panzer","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/6NhO8FSFg6azBGaga5IaSNaUNEs.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Commandant","credit_id":"62019c2ad371970043e7694b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vadim Uraneff","original_name":"Vadim Uraneff","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kyrill Vronsky","credit_id":"62019c39a24232004329ad5c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilyan Tashman","original_name":"Lilyan Tashman","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/vZPbaXbyMUxnxtEjiJYaMuvWD9T.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Beautiful Blonde","credit_id":"62019c47e54d5d001cff9618","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1503954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena D'Algy","original_name":"Helena D'Algy","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/9iCOZVMLNZAhAenAvN53JmgsNbv.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Beautiful Brunette","credit_id":"62019c551e92250042586426","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James A.
