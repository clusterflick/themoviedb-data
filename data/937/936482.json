Appropriating an MTV-like format to critique and question the capitalist commodification of Malcolm X’s subversive politics, X-PRZ sets computer-manipulated imagery of Malcolm X against advertising logos, archival footage, TV imagery, and a propulsive soundtrack of rock music by R.E.M. and Nine Inch Nails. – Tony Cokes","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/evgP9byfjCVWG6PPkDyihwtWSKA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Sell Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Cokes","original_name":"Tony Cokes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6203135e3009aa004269c2a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/evgP9byfjCVWG6PPkDyihwtWSKA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
