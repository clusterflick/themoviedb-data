Ignoring the family festivities, her parents ditch her for a day, leaving her in the care of a neighbor. The girl will regress to the events that have hurt her.  \"Rabbits have been a symbol of childhood ever since Lewis Carroll's portray of a certain elusive character, but it is in the interpretation of each psyche that it takes a more perpetual shape. In my analysis of its symbolism, the rabbit expresses a female childhood at an age close to puberty, along with the desire to leave the bonds; perhaps a virginal consciousness that remains in the symbol of rabbits to this very day.\"  Laura Maria Isabel Ruiz
