Following this motto, dance teacher Alan Brooks shows 25 vocational school students what they are capable of, and how they can master life with more confidence as a result. WE ARE GOOD is a gripping account of the fascination of dance, faith in oneself and others, enthusiasm, dedication, respect and lust for life - the dream of a tolerant and diverse community. The film not only spotlights dance and music but also existent social role models and shows how we can emancipate ourselves from them.","popularity":0.0738,"poster_path":"/eHtSLFlYHCEwccaVZFgp7SiJGql.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule f端r Fernsehen und Film
