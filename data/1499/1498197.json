Even worse she is not sure that she wants to continue their relationship any longer. Oscar is devastated by the rejection and is uncertain what to do next. After visiting a friend who suggested the old clich√© that love conquers all, Oscar resorts to an extremely unusual method to solve the problem of Lulu's reluctance.

Next morning when he is discovered, still alive, he refuses to surface until he has seen Lulu.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5at6NCGeGCUZj84oqe08S85m550.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Held His Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Ryan","original_name":"Amanda Ryan","popularity":1.2487,"profile_path":"/yIJH20UUl3x2JulTGXMRrPlTO7j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"684dbfbc26f0afc2351bee22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Chapman","original_name":"Mark Chapman","popularity":0.6293,"profile_path":"/fWOr0yEFH6n5hRWgB399OK6LRz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Detective","credit_id":"684dbfcd1bc1d2e03db0e06c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Tully","original_name":"Gillian Tully","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Waitress","credit_id":"684dbfe9f9743db94b3fe342","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5504954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Lowenstein","original_name":"Stephen Lowenstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684dbf97b18e08d8175c7a7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5504954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Lowenstein","original_name":"Stephen Lowenstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684dbfa9f0993891e43fe384","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0160510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5at6NCGeGCUZj84oqe08S85m550.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
