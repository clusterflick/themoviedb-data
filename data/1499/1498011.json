She had not been home for two years, since the beginning of the war. Upon exiting the train, she immediately runs into her old friend Andrii, with whom she once filmed a documentary and now shares a mutual sympathy. Now, he is a military man. Dasha's parents pick her up, and she asks them to give Andrii a lift. On the way home, Andrii is invited to dinner. Dasha spends her weekends with him, gets to know his platoon commander, and falls into the vortex of Andrii's internal conflicts with his military colleagues. When Andrii got wounded at the front, his expensive things - a bulletproof vest and a helmet - were supposed to be retrieved by his colleagues, who, however, were just not disciplined enough and lost Andrii's things.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rmDWWNOlmn4HPNW4bmL59f37lmr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where`s My Body Armor?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"De mii bronik?","type":"transiteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daria Penkova","original_name":"Daria Penkova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684d6943b963c0e95c1bec39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daria Penkova","original_name":"Daria Penkova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684d694f9e85afcb973442ea","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daria Penkova","original_name":"Daria Penkova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684d6959a0c6e5041ebb4bd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daria Penkova","original_name":"Daria Penkova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684d696672276fc73bbb495d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5504421,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vita Stoikova","original_name":"Vita Stoikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684d697d5b83eb6b5db0dda2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37303160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/rmDWWNOlmn4HPNW4bmL59f37lmr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
