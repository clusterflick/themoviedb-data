Set against the expansive and eerie backdrop of rural Victoria, the film follows Francesca, a woman in her seventies, as she reflects on the harrowing past that fractured her community - a mysterious sound virus that compelled people to dance until death.  Having spent decades in isolation, evading the sound’s haunting echo, Francesca is now a shadow of her former self. But as the sound begins to creep back into her world, she is forced to confront not only the trauma of what was lost but the enduring pull of what once was.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resonance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3844485,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Pollyanna Carveth","original_name":"Pollyanna Carveth","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ec22acaf33a218dbb4ff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
