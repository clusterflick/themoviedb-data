The person waiting in the confessional is Damian, an unemployed thief who reveals he has killed a young man.  Oscar begins to suspect that the victim might be his missing nephew. Now, Oscar faces a profound moral dilemma: he holds information that could finally give Mariana the answer she’s been desperately searching for about her son’s whereabouts, but revealing it would mean breaking the sacred seal of confession, a violation that could lead to his excommunication from the Church he has devoted his life and faith to.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":265333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sirio Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Secret of Confession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria del Rosario Bejarano","original_name":"Maria del Rosario Bejarano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684de1140ee7e0b662344301","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505207,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaspar Lemos","original_name":"Gaspar Lemos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684de163ec73293cd7bb4c19","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505210,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Abigail Nazaret Peréz","original_name":"Abigail Nazaret Peréz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684de1d1c83ebe7819bb4e6b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505215,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lara Ledezma","original_name":"Lara Ledezma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684de22a70df840a281befb5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505210,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Abigail Nazaret Peréz","original_name":"Abigail Nazaret Peréz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684de3fa075e60e6f934430d","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505246,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Axel Enríquez","original_name":"Axel Enríquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684de46a5b83eb6b5db0dfcf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria del Rosario Bejarano","original_name":"Maria del Rosario Bejarano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684dfdc416fa13e10a1beeba","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505461,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yazmin Soto","original_name":"Yazmin Soto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684dfde9d8519c0893b0e054","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505461,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yazmin Soto","original_name":"Yazmin Soto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684dfe2ce8c608addb3444b4","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
