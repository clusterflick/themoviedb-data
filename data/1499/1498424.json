The film was produced entirely in Source Filmmaker, by the fan group Fortress Films, and released for free on YouTube on February 20, 2023. Emesis Blue bases many of its assets directly on those of the original game, following the nine playable mercenary characters on a fictionalized depiction of the 2Fort multiplayer map, but maintains a mature, surreal tone with a largely original narrative. At a total of one hour and 48 minutes, it received critical acclaim for its high production value and length, both of which were said to be closer to those of a feature film than a typical Source Filmmaker production.  When an executive of the BLU Corporation mysteriously vanishes in Mortem, New Mexico, a private detective and washed-up war veteran team up to find him, yet the man they hunt is more dangerous than they can possibly imagine.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fbd481NbzldgL8wsna8nKNK0V9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emesis Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Payne","original_name":"Chad Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Fritz Ludwig","credit_id":"684e32626cf092f3cbb0e2d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Nichols","original_name":"Cameron Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Scout","credit_id":"684e323fbc04bf9bb63febaf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazzyjoeyjr","original_name":"Jazzyjoeyjr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Soldier","credit_id":"684e322fcee7bada933dfa05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pelizzari","original_name":"Anton Pelizzari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Zed & Del Conagher","credit_id":"684e324e61b42e75a95c7b01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahomas Himmler","original_name":"Ahomas Himmler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Scout's Mother","credit_id":"684e3281b18e08d8175c7c3d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Love","original_name":"David Love","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jules Archibald, Blutarch Mann","credit_id":"684e32e2d374eef39f3fe287","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Whinfield","original_name":"John Whinfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Police Officer, Street Voices, The Paramedic","credit_id":"684e3329cace8fd50bb0e037","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Payne","original_name":"Chad Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684e337db68cba1afa1ec653","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Payne","original_name":"Chad Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684e33b5b1d362cf68b0e0b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pelizzari","original_name":"Anton Pelizzari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684e33e1f33177836c5c7af6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5505707,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrei T.
