The title creates a tongue-in-cheek link between Uganda and Switzerland: \"Rolex\" is also an abbreviation of \"rolled eggs\" and refers to a well-known Ugandan street food dish-an omelette wrapped in a chapati.  In the film, the dish is called \"commando food\" meaning the food of the people in the slums. The film is about, among other things, criminals who grew up as street children, and a Swiss tourist who walks straight into their clutches.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wFgUyao1a5jNEmg0l30hAHFLdys.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73179,"logo_path":"/5RLXXpJKHnsn0oOFM80JdPVTvSC.png","name":"Ramon Film Productions","origin_country":"UG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UG","name":"Uganda"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2025-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rolex Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nabwana IGG","original_name":"Nabwana IGG","popularity":0.2127,"profile_path":"/4A8wgT5uCLYECTLeMZ0c6cWHvky.jpg","credit_id":"684f3fa94cff3224bc1ecac5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wO5O9cSJ416Y5NqNCHuzgA9RIkc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wFgUyao1a5jNEmg0l30hAHFLdys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Made and released for the \"Wakaliga\" exhibit at the Kunstmuseum Luzern.","release_date":"2025-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ROLEX  TIME !","key":"wOCU_gkLCO4","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-11T01:09:15.000Z","id":"684f3f2a4db2ecadbd1bf677"}]}}}
