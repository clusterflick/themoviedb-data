Blu in You is mediated through the lens of a female observer Melanie Smith, who views staged conversations between a visual arts curator Andrea Fatona and writer Nalo Hopkinson. The two explore black female subjectivity and sexuality by looking at various themes. Beginning with a cultural history of violence and sensationalism (embodied in the figure of Sara Baartman, \"the Hottentot Venus\"), then the gaze shifts to the present with discussions of celebrated cultural icons Josephine Baker, Dorothy Dandridge, and the muse Jeanne Duval, and the contemporary, black, queer female erotic body and sexuality.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blu in You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Mohabeer","original_name":"Michelle Mohabeer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684e3ce172276fc73bbb4ca9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
