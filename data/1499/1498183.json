On one side was a\r ruthless leader-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic-who claimed history\r was on his side. On the other, an alliance whose politicians believed\r that this was a crusade for moral values. It was a war where the\r politicians, rather than the military commanders, dictated the\r battlefield strategy and tactics. At its end, the war had produced one\r million refugees, thousands of civilian deaths, and a broken land still\r without peace. FRONTLINE correspondent Peter Boyer undertakes the first\r in-depth examination of a European war rife with diplomatic infighting\r and military stumbling.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/18hMlMoV9KSZwhimaDlXDsOUPbu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1198162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/18hMlMoV9KSZwhimaDlXDsOUPbu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
