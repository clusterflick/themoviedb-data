A five- day visual countdown precedes each new visual installment within that nine day time keeper. The rhythm provides structure, predictability and accountability, creating a lifecycle, and cyclical ritual for the makers and those experiencing the work. The literal “late night” window in which this work is made influences the dreamy, albeit lucid, mood, vocabulary and tone of work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"late_night_project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5506579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Cairns Cella","original_name":"Erin Cairns Cella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ef3f0cee7bada933dfe4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5506580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jascha Narveson","original_name":"Jascha Narveson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ef3fa789ef510931ec855","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
