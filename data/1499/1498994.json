Bored and horny supervillains like The Nameless Meta (Marc Cabot) are very bad news for beautiful women like Nadya (SugarNadya.) Looking for something - or someone - interesting to do, he soon encounters Nadya in the hall of his hotel hideout. Poor Nadya's not a Meta, just an ordinary human, so she's immediately just enchanted with The Nameless Meta, and then next thing you know she's naked and begging for his touch. After indulging her, her position as a Russian Tea Girl on his staff seems like a lock-in.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":235703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreams of Control Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This sweetheart was in the right place at the right time... but met the wrong man.","title":"Sweet As Sugar","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5507700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sugar Nadya","original_name":"Sugar Nadya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nadya","credit_id":"684faa345aa37572d4295412","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":4869018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Cabot","original_name":"Marc Cabot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Nameless Meta","credit_id":"684faa4743b50130475c82f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5507672,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marc Cabot","original_name":"Marc Cabot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684faa6126f0afc2351bf552","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":4869018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Cabot","original_name":"Marc Cabot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684faa8b905436f1ae3dffbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4869022,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Cabot","original_name":"Marc Cabot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684faaa5104285654a1bf844","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5507673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Cabot","original_name":"Marc Cabot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684faab9e9ca8a7b3c3febe4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9678,"name":"mind control"},{"id":194404,"name":"supervillain"},{"id":353612,"name":"comic book universe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
