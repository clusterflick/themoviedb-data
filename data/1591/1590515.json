When she feigns an interest in his father, Carver attempts to disgrace his family name by working as a farmhand and later as a busboy in a hotel. However, the newspapers only praise him for his self-sacrificing principles; and finding that he cannot bring shame to the family through menial labor, he takes up with a notorious actress. But when this maneuver also fails, he returns to his former fiancée, who has no further complaint about his being an inexperienced dullard.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4W837GFeGhkZYqe9pU9beeHTSAB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Amateur Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wanted: A Blemish","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryant Washburn","original_name":"Bryant Washburn","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/5UlSMWoAnoXIoa5cTv7yf1yECRn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carver Endicott","credit_id":"692ccb4d8a56f6ff693ea06c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1415319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann May","original_name":"Ann May","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/127p9dCNQbedHB1T9WeUWerkPyq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Margaret Bedford","credit_id":"692ccb658a56f6ff693ea070","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Wingate","original_name":"Charles Wingate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carver Endicott, Sr.","credit_id":"692ccb7b0ffd03350ddc2e32","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1705217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Mayo","original_name":"Christine Mayo","popularity":0.1024,"profile_path":"/feB507fDHM4IypIHgsox0bLuRd7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Maybelle de Neville","credit_id":"692ccb9104ce570f9adc2f4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Bracey","original_name":"Sidney Bracey","popularity":0.2574,"profile_path":"/g8ZJZVGVqa5Hn8sEsLjkIKjTVv9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hopkins","credit_id":"692ccbbad172f9b4f03ea048","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norris Johnson","original_name":"Norris Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"692ccbccfd638ea26a113e8c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Pettie","original_name":"Graham Pettie","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Farmer Brown","credit_id":"692ccbde6be48d329ce3371f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Dodge","original_name":"Anna Dodge","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/6gjFkcwkKKag9gKPjSvYIOhjUcf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Brown","credit_id":"692ccbf0fd638ea26a113e94","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Campbell","original_name":"Maurice Campbell","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ccc06c83c1b1135511e39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douglas Bronston","original_name":"Douglas Bronston","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ccc163081467496dc2f4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848626,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry J.
