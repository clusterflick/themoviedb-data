When a devoted but exhausted father-to-be sets out to secure a single pastry for his very pregnant wife, he's pulled into an absurd, high-stakes race against his equally stubborn neighbor. What begins as a simple errand spirals into sabotage, rivalry, and sheer chaos-until a sudden twist reminds everyone what truly matters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lOV8EPNnTE3m0nJMvTgfiV8Zooj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":272463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sasha Gitin Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2026-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Small pastry.
