What happens while the chickens eat the scraps that the pigs have left behind? Nothing less than an excellent portrait of the generational leap. Two women's voices become improvised rhapsodies of everyday life. Grandmother and granddaughter who, like the chickens, will have no name. Four beings for whom there will be no need to measure the rhythm of their lives and who, nevertheless, will live. And they will observe, learning and knowing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2013-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duas pitas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiana Gómez-Díaz","original_name":"Xiana Gómez-Díaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cd7dfe41e9cc21c3e9fcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
