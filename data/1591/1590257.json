Reared in the confines of the circus by Old Toodles the clown, in accordance with her father's dying request, Hoop-La naively accepts the attentions of good-looking Joe McGee, a cheap horseman, after winning a race for him as a jockey. Tony Barrows, the foppish scion of a wealthy family, falls in love with Hoop-La, but she resents his snobbery and makes faces at him. When Hoop-La learns that her father was wealthy, she secretly marries McGee to save herself from a dull society life, but when she discovers McGee's true character, she promises to keep him supplied with money if he leaves.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gP7LMz7BjDoKJvdxJGmYbD3Z1NC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41056,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film Corporation of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoop-La","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Cirkustøsen","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les saltimbanques","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"女曲馬師(フープ・ラ)","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Barker","type":"Alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Springtime of Youth","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Rhodes","original_name":"Billie Rhodes","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/8oXEkqwiT8FsWfgdyPW57zM3tN9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hoop-La Charters","credit_id":"692cbbb943c0ad7191286322","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Grassby","original_name":"Bertram Grassby","popularity":0.1617,"profile_path":"/fmam6pfammNnEBWsYxCKnYdRv3P.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tony Barrows","credit_id":"692cbbdc3d1e0017cedc2e9f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3320309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John B.
