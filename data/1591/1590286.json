Despite claiming he was far from the scene, he is arrested and humiliated by the media.  After years behind bars, Geraint is released but deeply changed. Determined to rebuild his name, he opens a luxurious entertainment complex called The Termine67 — part hotel, part mall, part gaming center. The name honors both his birth year (1967) and the Gen Z number “67”, making it popular among young people.  At first, the place becomes a symbol of hope and fun — flashing lights, games, and crowds. But Geraint’s quiet bitterness grows. He begins gathering people who feel wronged or abandoned by society — outcasts, hackers, criminals. Soon, The Termine67 transforms from a family attraction into a dark underground network.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/p9qNAQHDbhnYFczLthvOvwWe88P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toyland Studios Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"crime, redemption, horror, action, spies","title":"The Morter -
