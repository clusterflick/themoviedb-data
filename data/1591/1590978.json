It is an expression of a certain extremely private viewpoint. It reveals the existence of privacy in soft porn and mocks at the idea of male egocentricity; it is in sympathy with the autonomy of desire and fantasizes about revolution and liberty (not only those related to sex). The video is definitely neither a cry of a defender of feminism nor a female artist's opinion on sex. It not only depicts sex, but also talks about love and choices, the mental ones rather than the physical ones.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cao Fei","original_name":"Cao Fei","popularity":0.3601,"profile_path":"/gBJOFVy8iHrY8twGQOit1VBWk7n.jpg","credit_id":"692dc251f4a929b428dc3224","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
