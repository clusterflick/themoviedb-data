The man proves to be Ann's husband Ned, whom Bruce takes to his ranch in order to reform. When Ann comes to visit, Ned accuses her of having an affair with Bruce and, to punish her, he forces her to go to the mine which he has swindled from Benny Lynch's father. Fearing Lynch's vengeance, Bruce has warned Ann not to allow Ned near the mine, and so Ann sends Bruce an \"SOS\" via his horse Abe. Bruce manages to save Ned, but Lynch finally exacts his revenge by killing him, thus freeing Ann to marry Bruce.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ilDba6FjtosnHmZDtNn2Tl8Gdis.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shod with Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Et Præriens Mandfolk","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"男子の愛","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bruce of Circle A","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bruce Bayard","credit_id":"692cb12ad384161ed339889e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Ferguson","original_name":"Helen Ferguson","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/iUdYOBg85MKCIE6vQk7vnIYIddq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ann Lytton","credit_id":"692cb154c46a744537dc2df7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1321570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Schade","original_name":"Betty Schade","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/I4bTrOHFcjvlcsP26Xft4XGFeK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nora Brewster","credit_id":"692cb1626e665fdfe73e9f70","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cain","original_name":"Robert Cain","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":"/aBGtUfw3WZo0iF0y5EaYCoIIpz2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ned Lytton","credit_id":"692cb1720988ca30d1511dbd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1443696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Stewart","original_name":"George Stewart","popularity":0.899,"profile_path":"/4nnFJ2KxttO5G1F6aZwHU9cLMGr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Benny Lynch","credit_id":"692cb18351437d7195113dbc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson McDowell","original_name":"Nelson McDowell","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":"/c9WodDYcxUL0P5X1zq1DVgJXogG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Parson","credit_id":"692cb1927e0dcb66bb511e35","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Connolly","original_name":"Jack Connolly","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tommy Clary","credit_id":"692cb1a3fb266fec832862ee","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmett J.
