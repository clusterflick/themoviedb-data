The film delves into the pop-cultural phenomenon of Roy Bianco & Die Abbrunzati Boys – a band that represents far more than \"just\" Italian pop music. It explores authenticity, musical DNA, a longing for Italy, and the question: Why does this project work so well – and why does it resonate with so many people?  Through interviews, studio footage from Vienna, concert moments, expert opinions from figures such as Dieter Thomas Kuhn, Dr. Richard Brütting, and Prof. Dr. Christoph Jacke, as well as insights from longtime associates of the band, the film attempts to paint a multifaceted picture – without shattering the myth. The documentary aims to explain why RB&DAB are not just a fleeting phenomenon, but a band with lasting relevance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cbS6z5IQsWsw08m6RUigbpdVQZ4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Musik
