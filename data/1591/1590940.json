Initially, they were supposed to stay abroad only for the duration of the conflict, but after the war ended, the Greek government banned the children from returning home. One of them was Mito Klavchev, who never managed to return to his homeland. His son, Petro, embarks on a journey to trace his father's roots and the identity he lost years ago.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v7dCxxuI5m5pbYyipXf6kFgxTp9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amitall
