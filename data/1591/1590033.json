But now his parents have decided to go their separate ways and divorce - a catastrophe for the boy. The court awards custody to his mother (Karin Schröder), but Detlef harshly rejects his mother's new partner (Gerd Grasse). He sees him as the person responsible for his unhappiness. Hoping to improve the family atmosphere, his mother forbids the boy from meeting his biological father; this leads to Detlef's absolute despair, and he becomes a \"case\" for child welfare services.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AiJKXWtxvBVJbKBtsn2PkvM2yxu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210487,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Gate Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Case of Detlef Kammrath","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5847047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Sioda","original_name":"René Sioda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Detlef Kammrath","credit_id":"692bc271b00af7a1ca3b85cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5847048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burkhard Kurth","original_name":"Burkhard Kurth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Kammrath","credit_id":"692bc290533bbe1a2daa3f9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Schröder","original_name":"Karin Schröder","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/cVU8Z5f1k2hRgRf8faFG9vyEO6R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr Karoline Kammrath","credit_id":"692bc2d992c127c952247d58","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gert Grasse","original_name":"Gert Grasse","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/fATbi6YJilayrHDQ3FxGua0EQRA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Christian Methe","credit_id":"692bc30c57e7da58d217cded","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Solveig Müller","original_name":"Solveig Müller","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":"/ad21ovBwXECqRUmcFZqdhABbpCv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Renate Winkler","credit_id":"692bc32cc7db80a2ff9ae143","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Carstens","original_name":"Bruno Carstens","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/7qMd6YEjWMJApigBF2ay1JcX2DI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Heinz Winkler","credit_id":"692bc3477f28fdf387aa3fab","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1741004,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hedda Zinner","original_name":"Hedda Zinner","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692bc224e61e01d19d24ef17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1597690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Grabowsky","original_name":"Klaus Grabowsky","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692bc23c115854f2ea247d87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35288579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AiJKXWtxvBVJbKBtsn2PkvM2yxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15160,"name":"divorce"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":260101,"name":"ddr"},{"id":260283,"name":"german"},{"id":350689,"name":"children"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1981-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
