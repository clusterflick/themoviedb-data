Три интервью. 1994","overview":"\"Three Interviews.\" This is from my archives, a TV shoot with Dima Frolov, 1994.  Part one: my interview with Vlad for St. Petersburg TV. This interview is listed first because it's being published online for the first time. Part two: Vlad interviews Viktor Tuzov, and part three: Vlad interviews Timur Novikov (we filmed these two interviews for Tatyana Didenko's program \"Silence 9\"). I've already published the last two interviews online, but I decided to combine all three now—for friends, a chance to mentally transport myself back to those wonderful times when it seemed nothing could foreshadow disaster (at that point, Viktor was already terminally ill, but it was perceived as something extraordinary—an accident, an evil fate, the fate of one man).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eNHYNlYkjEK7qdbTxsbL9Vj1hRl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe.
