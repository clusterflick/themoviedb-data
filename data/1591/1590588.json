A group of men and women walk slowly through the grasslands beside the train tracks, forming the Agrupación Crotos Libres (Free Hobos). With anarchist roots, the hobos advocate a life without a fixed abode, free from material attachments, in defense of leisure and working-class solidarity. Since then, their \"non-profit\" walks have been their main activity. Pedro, one of the last remaining hobos, recounts their history through his amateur VHS footage.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zS56ZFYWTWKiItcndTt7wPX6rNR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crotos Libres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magalí Flaks","original_name":"Magalí Flaks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cf610d384161ed339899f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magalí Flaks","original_name":"Magalí Flaks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cf63ad384161ed33989a4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Azul Aizenberg","original_name":"Azul Aizenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cf6538ec939e2a3398ab5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533646,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mario Bocchicchio","original_name":"Mario Bocchicchio","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cf66599d2e6fd773ea049","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3243857,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Esteban Bellotto Kuzminsky","original_name":"Esteban Bellotto Kuzminsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cf6b6e05dbfed50113e78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1002,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zS56ZFYWTWKiItcndTt7wPX6rNR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":657}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
