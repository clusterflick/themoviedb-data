After purchasing a new wardrobe, Leona goes to a fashionable resort hotel where she poses as a widow with a mysterious past. She arouses the suspicions of the hotel clerk, a correspondence school sleuth, who suspects that she has kidnapped Captain Cromwell, a wealthy aviator who has been missing for several days.
