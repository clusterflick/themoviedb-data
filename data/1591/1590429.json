Now UK and European funding is also at risk. The world had been on track to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030 – because of Trump’s aid cuts, instead the death toll is set to triple by the decade’s end.  In this short film, Trew interviews a wide range of HIV/Aids patients, from children who’ve lost their parents to volunteer health workers trying to work out how to weather the storm as medication dries up.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Sentence: The Real Cost of Trump’s Aid Cuts on HIV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bel Trew","original_name":"Bel Trew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ca95ea55331d882e33694","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
