The narrator's singing highlights the characters' thoughts and beliefs, leaving the visualized action to take responsibility for the narrative and its understanding. Zobeide walks quickly through the night, fearful of being followed by someone, real or imagined, like the shadow that accompanies every gesture of a woman who must deal with a pre-written cultural landscape, where it is the male dream that must come true and where women are only dreams.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zobeide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5848511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luciangela Gatto","original_name":"Luciangela Gatto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692cbb69191e0684f2dc2ebc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
