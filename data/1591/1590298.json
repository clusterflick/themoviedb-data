In Littler's singular style, the film juxtaposes an author's interior landscape with the dramatic exterior of a remote coastal setting. Set within the interior of an old whaler's cottage, the film captures the ever-changing weather, the impervious sea, and moving clouds, reflecting a lifelong study of the interaction between man and place. Enigmatic, elegiac, and at times eerie, the film's pared-down images and otherworldly sound design reveal both the external beauty and the haunting interior landscape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/foHp3J81vilaADMyvRBaXKmQp4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slowboat Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Man.
