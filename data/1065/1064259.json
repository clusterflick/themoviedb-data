He is warned about overusing the Dream Catcher device but continues to do so as loneliness pervades his entire life. He dreams of the same woman day after day, but has no idea who she is. Until one day he runs into her. They hit it off and surprisingly they share a lot in common. But things are not exactly as they seem.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/7maWBwWkISZV6DFDUwmPjKk62Ja.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream
