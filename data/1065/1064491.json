Reflecting on the different contexts that propelled this form of community publishing, like Argentina’s 2001 economic crisis, the independent art scene, and the movements which formed around waste-pickers, the film’s narrative is developed through conversations with important actors from the cartonera world.","popularity":0.7336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
