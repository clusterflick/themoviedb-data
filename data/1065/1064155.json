In the street, Muscovites sell shoes, a dog and a monkey are sturdily dressed, the escalator takes us out of the metro while others swim in a steaming outdoor pool. Sometimes, to make a living, people dress up as clowns or wolves to lure passers-by into stores.\r The wolf gives the narrator his phone number. He is young and his name is Ilia Krone. His mouth is the same shape as hers like a perfect harmony. Moscow seems empty to him when he is away. \"He has a head for wanting to come to France\" a friend told him. Besides, things don't get better with time. Moscow is a city where it is said that the colder it is, the more people start to lie.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hAICbYaTlE5STq2y2RaNykWtAmc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Rêve De L'Ours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Pavia","original_name":"Valérie Pavia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a39a61aa789800ca0bb3f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAICbYaTlE5STq2y2RaNykWtAmc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
