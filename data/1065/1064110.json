The international team of 20 riders hailed from the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. All are living with Type 1 diabetes - collectively with a whopping 263 years of experience. As they journeyed across the country, they destroyed stereotypes and showed the world what living beyond Type 1 looks like. The team educated people on the warning signs of Type 1 and what it means to thrive with the chronic illness. They also raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Type 1 diabetes cure research.  â€”Dana Howe","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dedicated to all those who live beyond...","title":"Bike Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7867736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
