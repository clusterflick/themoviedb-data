With a mixture of fictional and documentary techniques, the film immerses us in the universe of sidecar racing, paying attention to the peculiarities of a vehicle driven by a magical alliance between pilot and passenger (or as it is known in sidecar jargon, 'monkey'). Aided by a dreamy musical score and Hélène Louvart’s deft cinematography, Love & Crashes explores technique and sensuality, control and spontaneity, the physical and the mental, speed and care.","popularity":0.112,"poster_path":"/1nmEOC47EHhgu5R7QMfyo2O4dXq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love & Crashes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucile Chaufour","original_name":"Lucile Chaufour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4a977209f180080ec6bed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56289,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hélène Louvart","original_name":"Hélène Louvart","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/aTcNiyNvU7j3xGBBsFdKm3OldYa.jpg","credit_id":"66604464389be4f543e990f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549348,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Deusy","original_name":"Richard Deusy","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66604471ea9e3bd344dddca1","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26351396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1nmEOC47EHhgu5R7QMfyo2O4dXq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2023-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
