Beauvais discovers that Sylvion, his best friend, has long carried on a clandestine love affair with Pauline. An artist acquaintance urges Gaston to comfort himself with absinthe. Gaston in his despair yields. From that moment the wreck of his career begins. Maddened by absinthe, he denounces Pauline at the marriage-altar on his wedding day, as Sylvion's cast-off mistress. Still driven by absinthe, he murders Sylvion and ultimately his brutalities drives Pauline, now a pitiful outcast of the streets, for she fled her home in shame after Gaston cast her off, to end her pathetic existence in the dark waters of the Seine.","popularity":0.2406,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wormwood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John St. Polis","original_name":"John St. Polis","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/q242vTdxgXFTVjmtDB5sPjxfhHy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63a5f1b8596a91008c4f7353","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3842893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Kaufman","original_name":"Ethel Kaufman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63a5f1c2c048a9007da8fb48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Arthur","original_name":"Charles Arthur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63a5f1c98c3159008a9f15c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1635093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar L.
