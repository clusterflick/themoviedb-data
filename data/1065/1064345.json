With an address in her pocket, she hopes to stay with Nassim, who assists rejected refugees. Nassim, however, claims to be unable to open the door. Having nowhere else to go, Roya is determined to stay. Slowly but surely, a conversation develops between the two. Marked by their past as refugees, they are both looking for a way out. They could be each other’s salvation, but a closed door stands between them. They get to know each other through the closed door, and so two life stories with one fate are unveiled.","popularity":0.3629,"poster_path":"/kdS9BXE2UIGke0SfZRx7JajHaRt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237679,"logo_path":"/e4grtrOY2NpxGyCAZOfKhKaXzmp.png","name":"100% Film &
