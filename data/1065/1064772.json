And Paris seen from its very bowels: by slow boat travels on the Seine.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/x0TeSXz4B1Xde8DIbGoDwHNuUrY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Terre des Vivants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"63a56ac4c048a9007da8d18e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x0TeSXz4B1Xde8DIbGoDwHNuUrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1992-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
