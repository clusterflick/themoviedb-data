Touré's next narrative project, Haramuya (1995), was again welcomed warmly and seen widely. But what happened then? How could an obviously gifted filmmaker from one of world cinema's true hubs, Burkina Faso, not find the means to continue? How did Touré end up riding a motorcycle, doing deliveries and errands? The fact that only a few years after Haramuya's release, Atria, the organisation where Touré deepened his technical knowledge of filmmaking, was closed down as the last francs of support were cancelled suggests that Touré's story is also a symptom of something more structural and grim.","popularity":0.0749,"poster_path":"/rQj5Ea68eU7fRTqHmIVdJqMnqdw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230255,"logo_path":"/hy89qMBuNI0ugUj0mzv4JlvlG2d.png","name":"908","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":86999,"logo_path":"/12bvJrCnsFtisFPvenW4BvWq021.png","name":"Generation Films","origin_country":"BF"},{"id":205579,"logo_path":"/gS38yKDiTo9KGgOubDDjZFC8Ijr.png","name":"DS Productions","origin_country":"ML"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ML","name":"Mali"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Taxi, The Cinema and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drissa Toure","original_name":"Drissa Toure","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66588c351d04f3b44d2d2ba5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaston Kaboré","original_name":"Gaston Kaboré","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/baKZufTJ17zJzYZ1Lc7QADj4BiL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66588c84a9aadc2d322d2db2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mory Kaba","original_name":"Mory Kaba","popularity":0.1219,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66588c8b74fb5bc7276c2b34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clément Tapsoba","original_name":"Clément Tapsoba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66588c928f75c3347a506069","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3842034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salam Zampaligre","original_name":"Salam Zampaligre","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a50068c048a900a748748c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3842034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salam Zampaligre","original_name":"Salam Zampaligre","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66588c4a23d6cea1046c2d33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21951504","wikidata_id":"Q126016930","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ujcznch2FRBbxY5fSuChjlvihZv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rQj5Ea68eU7fRTqHmIVdJqMnqdw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gwzaETfAyEdor5jXp0fukj8ZVxy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Le taxi, le cinéma et moi – trailer | IFFR 2023","key":"zLXCV9Smc0s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-12-19T20:47:44.000Z","id":"6658894b09a371848c2d22bf"}]}}}
