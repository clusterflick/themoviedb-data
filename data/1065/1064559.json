In one we watch the struggle of matches with a teapot. The matches will be helped by a candle and the matches will thank her very interestingly for disposing of the teapot. In the next story, we follow the story of a little weather pencil and a little knife who falls in love with her. But the knife is unlucky, and so in the end we see how the pencil turns out when instead of a knife he uses the services of a grater. The last story presents the relationship of clothes and irons. As in the previous cases, \"gratitude for help\"again comes into play. I'll keep the points of the individual parts for myself, so that you have something to watch if you're lucky enough to get to these films.","popularity":0.1176,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovenská filmová tvorba","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kontakty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslava Havettová","original_name":"Jaroslava Havettová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4edfa1b7294008aa987d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3842430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Filoména Urbaničová","original_name":"Filoména Urbaničová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a5758cfd630000a171dc77","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Pallós","original_name":"Alexander Pallós","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a5768ec6006d00a2bdff47","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslava Havettová","original_name":"Jaroslava Havettová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a5769bfd6300008846c061","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3842436,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henrieta Peťovská","original_name":"Henrieta Peťovská","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a575cd387651007e60966d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslava Havettová","original_name":"Jaroslava Havettová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a57562fd6300007e6b5d84","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslava Havettová","original_name":"Jaroslava Havettová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a57568befd91007dfef510","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dežo Ursiny","original_name":"Dežo Ursiny","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a5767a310325008cfca9d3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179287,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marta Solárová","original_name":"Marta Solárová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a5768438765100848af58a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslava Havettová","original_name":"Jaroslava Havettová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a576a63103250093228f38","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622931,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rudolf Urc","original_name":"Rudolf Urc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a5757abefd91007dfef51f","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
