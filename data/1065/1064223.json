Marcelinho documents a performance during which the artist mounted a bicycle wheel onto a stool in the middle of a large forest clearing in Peru, reimagining Marcel Duchamp’s famous readymade (a sculpture created from found objects). He removed the spokes, buried them, and set the stool on fire. Only the wheel’s metal rim remained, which Paucar then rolled around the grass using a stick. He recalled, “When I saw Duchamp’s Bicycle Wheel at a museum in Berlin. . . . it made me remember how I would play with a bicycle wheel as a child.” [Overview Courtesy of MoMA]","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eDZ6ELw616jMdhwQ3qWuw8pHacr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2005-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marcelinho","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Paucar","original_name":"Antonio Paucar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63a3ce4c25a536009b93d209","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Paucar","original_name":"Antonio Paucar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3ce68435011009f74a74b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1039,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDZ6ELw616jMdhwQ3qWuw8pHacr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
