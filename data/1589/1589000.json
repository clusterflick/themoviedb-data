The principal subject of the film is New York street culture: birds, dogs, transportation, derelicts, pedestrians and seamy life, intercut with a very few fragments of nature, indoor and simple subjects. Each sound has been written as dialogue or collected from the radio or produced on synthesizer to accompany each image and establish attitude: amusement, amazement, contrast, bewilderment, humor, absurdity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Creston","original_name":"Bill Creston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929094823baaad693249426","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
