Between her mother's dreams of surgery, her grandmother's rituals and the ridicule of her peers, the girl seeks salvation in singing in the choir and friendship with the only person close to her, Yura. But an accident leads them both to injury, and Nadya's life changes forever. Once in a Moscow clinic, she encounters children whose trials are much more difficult than her own. The operation, which is supposed to give hope, turns into a painful choice - between the expectations of the family, the fear of rejection and their own right to happiness. The ending of this story turns out to be completely different from what her loved ones were preparing for.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":281539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karelia Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Бо-бо","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Bo-bo","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4198543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darya Alkhova","original_name":"Дарья Альхова","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":"/grMxgHOTpYBRwIbPbLqEUNH2aLQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69275223e0c4caff91a758d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5322939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Tsyganov","original_name":"Александр Цыганов","popularity":0.3972,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6927522b52403149d5c122c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3122621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Lebedeva","original_name":"Марина Лебедева","popularity":0.3774,"profile_path":"/w2VVu8nEBuCOjlCBQ4tZWLRIPKu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69275232eedb15746e26bfb8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Lapshina","original_name":"Ольга Лапшина","popularity":0.4436,"profile_path":"/g8RNLIB9hJXMZwRlQ5aK9dENEJj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"69275238b4e504105eea9fb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2033326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergej Kolesnikov","original_name":"Сергей Колесников","popularity":0.3785,"profile_path":"/ngyVGIbc5gHR4lJJMWxkR6blssW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6927523f2952522785245512","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Ryazantsev","original_name":"Олег Рязанцев","popularity":0.5154,"profile_path":"/gYvLlFBVSrUMsUAM0WWR2OffDEC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69275246159e8c918226bf52","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4421752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Ulanovskaya","original_name":"Ирина Улановская","popularity":0.2398,"profile_path":"/g1X3epi4RN9WsXRatj0DDzttUwp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6927524feedca2470e248be3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5840896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Dovzhenko","original_name":"Мария Довженко","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6927525597fec70dfb248c7c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3398233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Tolstikov","original_name":"Игорь Толстиков","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6927525b1a5c802c1cd9cbd2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4337279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alesya Alisievich","original_name":"Алеся Алисиевич","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"69275268f27adf435ad9cc27","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4116534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Kuzina","original_name":"Анастасия Кузина","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692752aaa8eeb62a2cc12195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4116534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Kuzina","original_name":"Анастасия Кузина","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692752aea8eeb62a2cc12198","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2649268,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Innokentiy Smirnov","original_name":"Иннокентий Смирнов","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692752b5a777c445c330cf46","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2491091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleksandr Prosyanov","original_name":"Александр Просянов","popularity":0.2968,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692752ce52403149d5c122c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38593241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
