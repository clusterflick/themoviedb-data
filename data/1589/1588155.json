It captures the moment — when he is around 90 years old — that he returns to an old drawer, tries to pick up his tools, and realizes he no longer has the strength to hold them. That simple gesture becomes the symbolic trigger: the end of his long creative cycle and the beginning of a farewell to his art. From there, the film documents the dismantling of Vlavianos’s studio and workspace, and the gradual process of his withdrawal from physical creation. It’s not just a retrospective of works: it’s a portrait of decline, memory, mortality, and legacy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6R0tHVXk89j2gwlo6TgXqlEg0O1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77846,"logo_path":"/cV5wlhNOJH2TZiWU3Z5bvJwGE7s.png","name":"Na Laje Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Art remains.
