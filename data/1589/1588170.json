Two shots from a lupara shotgun fatally wounded him outside the home of his future wife. He was only 27 years old. His crime, as a trade unionist, was refusing to cook rotten meat for the canteen of Fatme, a large industrial plant in Pagani. He had also fought to improve the working conditions of his fellow workers in the factory. The Camorra did not forgive him. To date, there have been no convictions for either the instigators or the perpetrators of the murder of Esposito Ferraioli.  The short film begins and ends at the scene of the murder. The story begins immediately after the execution. It is 1978.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/x1eU4U95yWLBJppAnWAIon3rLK1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Libera - Associazione CONTRO LE MAFIE","origin_country":""},{"id":281529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambress'...
