Using one of pornography’s most familiar devices, the close-up, a pair of female lips, projected onto the theater’s entrance doors, recites a litany of improbable solicitations to passersby in a sensual voice that emanates from the intercom in the ticket-booth window. Liquid-crystal panels embedded in the facade intermittently phase to transparent peepholes revealing a jeweler’s box emblazoned with one of four words—discreet, innocent, genteel, and virtuous—that stand in counterpoint to the licentious terms displayed on the theater’s front wall: shameless, savage, sinful, and scandalous. The installation on the marquee is by Jenny Holzer.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soft Sell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Diller","original_name":"Elizabeth Diller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927870e73b53cbe1f26c002","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Scofidio","original_name":"Ricardo Scofidio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927872059faf41409371828","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
