Told through a queer, horror-inspired lens, the narrative follows an intimate relationship that slowly ruptures under the weight of obsession and emotional consumption.  Through visceral styling, symbolic objects, and layered sound, the film explores how affection can spill over into possession; how love, when held too tightly, begins to bruise, bite, and leave its mark. The pomegranate, ever bursting and staining, becomes a motif for desire: tender, violent, and impossible to contain.  Inspired by theories of the abject, queer temporality, and the monstrous feminine, Eat My Heart Out exists in a world just slightly askew; somewhere between self and other, beauty and decay. It is a study in transformation, a love story soaked in unease, and a quiet question: how far would you go for a love that consumes?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/if76lPVnJDxfCiZsBxyJp6os0P8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far would you go for a love that consumes?","title":"Eat My Heart Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauryn Hill","original_name":"Lauryn Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Unnamed Character","credit_id":"6927a2c90e552cc66b371931","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Izzy Sallows","original_name":"Izzy Sallows","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Unnamed Character","credit_id":"6927a2df1a5c802c1cd9ccf9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maddie Hardy","original_name":"Maddie Hardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a06cd2ba0d8569eaa261","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841448,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Millie Phillips","original_name":"Millie Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a0dc2952522785245689","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841449,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sofía Brown","original_name":"Sofía Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a108f27adf435ad9cd9f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cody Veal","original_name":"Cody Veal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a12ddf1ecfb3b237189d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maddie Hardy","original_name":"Maddie Hardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a14785fe4502b3ea9c32","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramani Richar","original_name":"Ramani Richar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a18a0086856765a759ef","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maddie Hardy","original_name":"Maddie Hardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a1a1792b9dd8f2a758de","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841454,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Soriah Abraham","original_name":"Soriah Abraham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a1befefb70501426c061","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841457,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Marrius Pichay","original_name":"Marrius Pichay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a1dccb2c58a363c12291","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maddie Hardy","original_name":"Maddie Hardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a1fca298fb991b30d19d","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maddie Hardy","original_name":"Maddie Hardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927a209072141e20cd9cd34","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AqvqZhxEigpPB5Z2389wAU52XUZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/if76lPVnJDxfCiZsBxyJp6os0P8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":265587,"name":"queer horror"},{"id":317274,"name":"horror romance"},{"id":362903,"name":"abjection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
