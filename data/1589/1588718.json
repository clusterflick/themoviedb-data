The high priest arranges for his rival to be stoned to death, and the queen, rather than submit, allows herself to be buried alive with her lover's body. Many centuries later, a ship steams toward Cairo, Egypt. Among its passengers are wealthy playboy Reginald Stanhope; vaudeville dancer Celia Thaxter and her manager, Gregory Gallup, who together are maneuvering Reginald into marrying her. Also aboard are Herbert Boone, a shell-shocked drug addict, and his nagging wife, Adele; Kelim Pasha, an Egyptian prince who attracts Adele Boone's affections; and Mahmud, an Egyptian mystic who insists that Celia Thaxter and Herbert Boone are the reincarnations of an ancient Egyptian queen and a priest who sacrificed themselves for their love.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yK7mFTC0RROvIUvNKJkZil20sYh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Betty Compson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Always the Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"再生の女王","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Compson","original_name":"Betty Compson","popularity":0.5698,"profile_path":"/jjizL1zum4tKBqeTzKhPuqlae5a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Celia Thaxter / Queen Neco Tokris","credit_id":"69286b7a632305690c245a1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emory Johnson","original_name":"Emory Johnson","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/bhjxPzKIyVslP87KkDyDpUJoTks.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herbert Boone","credit_id":"69286b96f27adf435ad9d09b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Pawn","original_name":"Doris Pawn","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/d2d8vvnE5maAAW0tZzmc3LpGTGS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Adele Boone","credit_id":"69286bc2632305690c245a2c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Pring","original_name":"Gerald Pring","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Reginald Stanhope","credit_id":"69286bef0086856765a75c9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Rosson","original_name":"Richard Rosson","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/hjJhqwxMpdVpj5C9yfmM0H4MvgD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mahmud","credit_id":"69286c0792edc640ed248ea1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5842537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Delmore","original_name":"Arthur Delmore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gregory Gallup","credit_id":"69286c1afc9c528ad7245b34","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1416237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Macey Harlam","original_name":"Macey Harlam","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/6S2WQu6PTCUs1PsnqHNq12Ah8b4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kelim Pasha","credit_id":"69286c2ee4a60f2a14d9d069","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Rosson","original_name":"Arthur Rosson","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69286c46a8eeb62a2cc126de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chester L.
