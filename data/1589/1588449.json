Every inch of his skin holds the touch, the caresses, the breath of another body that loved him and is no longer there. His reflection has become a cruel reminder of what was shared. Adam is condemned to be everything he loved, everything he lost. After the breakup, Adam begins a desperate search to erase that memory. It's not just a memory; it's a stain, a weight on his skin, a mark that accompanies him even in silence. He tries to purify himself with water, to wash away the traces, to tear away what he lived through. But the water that cleanses also erodes. What disappears is not just the other person; it's a part of himself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De barro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
