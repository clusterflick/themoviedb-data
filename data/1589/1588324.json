For 400 years, the village of Trancoso had protected its religious traditions and cultural habits, rooted in Jesuit foundations. With this sudden “discovery,” the once-isolated community began to attract travelers from around the world. The symbols and rituals of fishermen and farmers seemed destined to disappear. Yet something unexpected happened. The historic bubble burst, but the culture survived. Even while opening to the contemporary world, Trancoso preserved its centuries-old festivities blending Indigenous, African and Catholic-Portuguese origins. These celebrations and local stories form the narrative and poetic center of the film: resistance and coexistence shaping identity. The documentary invites us into the Feast of St. Sebastian, the heart of this transformation. “Cordel” becomes the key to unlock a hidden past — and to guard memories against the silent advance of modernity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/s0KmQgC7xHGFEpgGkMH7yVGSNrJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales of Trancoso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seu Flor","original_name":"Seu Flor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6927889b43f4b5919926c21b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elba Ramalho","original_name":"Elba Ramalho","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/mvADo7bWe45oCtEnb1pD1ruaRYt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"692788a51f7534ad602458f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josenildo da Conceição Ferr","original_name":"Josenildo da Conceição Ferr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69278936c578854951c1220b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquim Alves","original_name":"Joaquim Alves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6927895147e951ad7ca75b7b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Urizzi","original_name":"Pedro Urizzi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/5sQnLFO8c40B2FsyVWVxKW7R5VL.jpg","credit_id":"6927899f9e5d52773e245881","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Urizzi","original_name":"Pedro Urizzi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/5sQnLFO8c40B2FsyVWVxKW7R5VL.jpg","credit_id":"692789a9cb3a5c6c26248bf7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felipe Solari","original_name":"Felipe Solari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/Mq2ceGX5cBHq94fUwFLLyeRnbq.jpg","credit_id":"692789b779a48b40f7248de8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felipe Solari","original_name":"Felipe Solari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/Mq2ceGX5cBHq94fUwFLLyeRnbq.jpg","credit_id":"692789c477cc5b7167245791","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estas Tonne","original_name":"Estas Tonne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tqNgXenMOnmSvyrjCHHiSytPang.jpg","credit_id":"692789fb2952522785245612","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4179100,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruno Dias","original_name":"Bruno Dias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69278a17009327a50c245581","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111112,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rodrigo Ferrante","original_name":"Rodrigo Ferrante","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69278ac2fded68c40e30d090","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6131078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxLjis9UVqtUal8Ke4cFdYlHC2Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s0KmQgC7xHGFEpgGkMH7yVGSNrJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Documentário \"Cordel de Trancoso\" - Trailer","key":"200239301","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-01-19T20:19:00.000Z","id":"69278860b579088f9b248be6"}]}}}
