Unfortunately this ability comes at a cost. He doesn't know why he reversed time when he actually does it, because there can only be one time line at all times. So his past future doesn't exist anymore and he has to choose differently. Dominik Trapp, a boy with a deadly sick sister, finds out that Kai possesses these abilities and wants him to assist in saving his sister who is suffering from brain cancer. However, Kai can't and doesn't want to get caught up with Dominik. Therefore a game of cat and mouse ensues which leaves Dominik increasingly angry and he finally takes action.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gott würfelt nicht nur einmal","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3651338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Matic-Arnauld des Lions","original_name":"Philippe Matic-Arnauld des Lions","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Chief physician","credit_id":"6928daa973b53cbe1f26c515","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5379249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Maier","original_name":"Thomas Maier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kai Roth","credit_id":"6928dac17e2cd1388430d465","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5843233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Niethammer","original_name":"Birgit Niethammer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lena Neumann","credit_id":"6928dae5e92f3841ada75e91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5843234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Schmucker","original_name":"Julian Schmucker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dominik Trapp","credit_id":"6928daf861f6ba2bf1a75f6d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5843235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Schmucker","original_name":"Julian Schmucker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6928db190a9b7f7ec1d9d0f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4832385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Maier","original_name":"Thomas Maier","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6928db29cb3a5c6c2624920c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10322702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"DE","iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/sRd60kQ9CC2y3jNdwCiFmnNbMjC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gott würfelt nicht nur einmal - 4K Teaser","key":"AJfEYpB7OSk","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-20T17:00:00.000Z","id":"6928dce6fded68c40e30d56c"}]}}}
