Tenir !","overview":"Reynold is a 75-year-old Haitian political refugee, severely weakened by diabetes. He is also a talented singer-songwriter. His music is his refuge, the trace, the scent of his longed-for homeland. It is a gift and a legacy he received and must pass on. He knows this, but he can't seem to manage it. Trapped in limbo, ill, he is unable to move forward. He asks me for help. I do so by filming him. Will this man, broken by exile, depressed, sick, shaken by something in our friendship, find the energy to record his album?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"M ap kenbe !
