On the day of the Euro’s semi-finals, cocky lad’s lad, Kyle, is completely swept up in the chaos of ‘it’s coming home’. But before he can scream the national anthem at the top of his lungs, Kyle’s forced to watch a Punch and Judy show in his drama class. At first, Kyle mocks the lunacies of this outdated show. But the more Kyle watches, the more he’s reminded of a memory he’s done everything to run away from. Now on a slippery slope, Kyle turns to familiar vices and destructive national pride, leaving him on the brink of becoming his own worst nightmare.  Set against the red-and-white backdrop of a country blinded by its desire to win, Squeaky Bum explores how patriotism and violence can intertwine, whilst holding up a mirror to masculinity at breaking point.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Squeaky Bum's Never Gonna Be One of the Lads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33298563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
