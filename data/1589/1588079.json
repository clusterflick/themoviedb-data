With songs like \"Rat Trap\" and the worldwide hit \"I Don't Like Mondays,\" they made music history—biting, melodic, and socially critical. After a long hiatus, they returned in 2013 and have since proven that taking a stand is timeless. Their current chapter combines classics with fresh energy, especially for their 50th anniversary. At Wacken, on August 1st 2025, they brought their rebellious mix of rock, punk, and new wave to the stage, as a reminder that good protest always needs a damn strong chorus.\r Setlist: \"Rat Trap\", \"(I Never Loved) Eva Braun\", \"Like Clockwork\", \"Neon Heart\", \"(She's Gonna) Do You In\", \"Someone's Looking at You\", \"I Don't Like Mondays\", \"Against the World\", \"She's So Modern\", \"Diamond Smiles\", \"The Boomtown Rats\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boomtown Rats: Live at Wacken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Geldof","original_name":"Bob Geldof","popularity":0.2572,"profile_path":"/9fDWH8hQifcpzWHcTjBQLngsvJT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals / Guitar","credit_id":"6927159d1ddc82e41cd9cb5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462389,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pete Briquette","original_name":"Pete Briquette","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bass / Vocals / Synths","credit_id":"692715b5d8135ae325a757a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garry Roberts","original_name":"Garry Roberts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"692715c472e9163ae5eaa03a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Crowe","original_name":"Simon Crowe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Drums / Vocals","credit_id":"692715d40cc54f1d51d9cab1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Dunn","original_name":"Alan Dunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"692715e885fe4502b3ea99b4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darren Beale","original_name":"Darren Beale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"692715f6b8ebbf3ee7371788","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
