He's a man who transformed his life, marked by violence, gangs, and addiction, into a story of redemption through art. After surviving a near-fatal ordeal, he found in sign painting and murals a way to heal and restore identity to his community. With his chopper bike, his music, and his wooden cart full of paint, Chapo travels the neighborhood, filling the walls with color and hope. Beyond his tough exterior, he reveals himself as a loving father, a committed artist, and a symbol of change in an environment still battling violence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calaveras y diablitos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César \"Chapa\" Meza","original_name":"César \"Chapa\" Meza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6927da6f9441301f2ac124a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Dávalos","original_name":"Diego Dávalos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927da8e79a48b40f7248f34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis G.
