In that enforced silence, he confronts his anxiety, his loneliness, and everything he's been avoiding. Searching for a cigarette to calm himself, he ends up finding something much simpler and more human: the presence of his mother. Night Light is a portrait of the weariness of living on autopilot and the importance of pausing, even for a moment, to reconnect with what truly matters.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luz de noche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Romero","original_name":"Alejandro Romero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6927d9884779d992ddd9cea7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Vera","original_name":"Carmen Vera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6927d98f98bc74bb14eaa175","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Arzate Fernández","original_name":"Emiliano Arzate Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927d9a2abfaa75736eaa445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5841713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Arzate Fernández","original_name":"Emiliano Arzate Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6927d9ae33220d1d62d9cf46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
