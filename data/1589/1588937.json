She goes to investigate and finds a curious entity identifying as Selene. Red doesn't care about her galaxy of origin and engages without thinking twice. Selene is strong but Red holds. Unfortunately, Selene has the ability to absorb Red's power. With every withdrawal, Red becomes weaker. Despite losing her powers, Red still manages to hang on. Selene hasn't broken a sweat but decides to call in her \"insurance policy\". An entity identifying as Reaver appears and engages the depowered Red. Poor Red doesn't have a chance to breath as Reaver and then Selene and Reaver fully dismantle the poor heroine. This is just the beginning for Red as Selene has been instructed to utterly humiliate the cocky heroine and prepare her for her Master. Red couldn't possibly be prepared for what's in store as she discovers what it means to be \"Ravaged\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ravaged I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5611156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco","original_name":"Coco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Redwing","credit_id":"6928dc8a4779d992ddd9d1bd","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":5546394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ophelia H.
