A nude, aging male body shaped by sunshine and exercise. In search of an image that is not obscured by clothing, I found Werner. A seventy-something raw food nut who loves to spend the summer months outdoors on the outskirts of Berlin. A fleeting acquaintance deepens into a fragile friendship. Then an accident I can't recall. Werner finds me in the woods. He wants to introduce me to Buddha and teach me mindfulness. Guided by the sun I follow him to Pattaya, Thailand. The air hangs oppressively over this unreal place. An amalgam of incense, the sound of crashing waves and prostitution. A different Werner emerges. Disgust, aversion. Towards Werner, towards the male within me. Searching for a morality that neither exploits nor is based upon any convention.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Sex Please","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
