This orientation, delivered by an ambiguously-gendered guide, is essentially a monologue that plays with comedic and narrative conventions while also exploring foundational questions about language: its relationship to knowledge, time, abstraction, experience, communication, and intimacy. As the title suggests, the video is also interested in the surfeit of information currently at our disposal, the time we take in downloading it, and the relationships forged by human animals in its haze.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Time Eaters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela McGuire","original_name":"Angela McGuire","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Orientation Leader","credit_id":"5a8238209251411681007ab3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1977193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Davis","original_name":"Phil Davis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"New Human","credit_id":"5a8238320e0a26082f0008a9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Dodge","original_name":"Harry Dodge","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/f402t01SHmAJL8ybStXp7XqOwsE.jpg","credit_id":"5a82384cc3a3684cdf008865","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
