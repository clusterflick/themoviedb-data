Oreste is driven by the Furies to atone for killing his mother Clytemnestre. When he and his companion Pylade are shipwrecked on the island of Tauride, the king Thoas demands they be sacrificed. At the center of the drama is Iphigénie, Oreste’s long-lost sister. Forced to live among her enemies, she holds the lives of the captives in her hands—unaware that one of them is her brother.  (Iphigénie en Tauride is performed in an adaptation of the 1779 Paris version edited by Gerhard Croll, by arrangement with Bärenreiter.)","popularity":0.4637,"poster_path":"/uTrO2M2F8NX06TUDOoUaFjB8Jy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
