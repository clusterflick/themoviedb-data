The friend begins a total make-over upon her friend. First she slathers her in mud-packs, and then she encases her in lovely silk dresses. Soon the plain woman is transformed into an extraordinary beauty. It is no surprise that her boss, not knowing her true identity, falls hopelessly in love with her. Singing, dancing and romancing ensues. Songs include: \"A Picture No Artist Can Paint,\" \"You Gotta Be Modernistic,\" \"I'm Telling the World About You,\" \"Maybe Someday,\" and \"Can I Help It.\"","popularity":0.5955,"poster_path":"/wIM7RJLYVkOdj2lxT7zaRYCsfgR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her only leg-acy was a pair of perfect calves - but the havoc they created!","title":"The Golden Calf","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Her Golden Calf","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mulhall","original_name":"Jack Mulhall","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/4r33PICmACJZ2Bjum0v1EkvOxbx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Philip Homer","credit_id":"5a807c80925141410701f247","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Carol","original_name":"Sue Carol","popularity":0.2229,"profile_path":"/p8xbZH7XicN9sZNu3aEmGsqBpAh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marybelle Cobb","credit_id":"5a807c880e0a262aa9022557","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"El Brendel","original_name":"El Brendel","popularity":0.1876,"profile_path":"/yGYoP6Ydhot6LduPSPkYmIhoxe4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Knute Olson","credit_id":"5a807c94c3a36818ac01e460","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie White","original_name":"Marjorie White","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/5u6WpCtjAjodmwVcpTDY1oHdaPy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"5a807c9f92514140f801ef09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Keene","original_name":"Richard Keene","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/kSrGTjWZtOfTzyQ12WT7W9H09pi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"5a807cad0e0a262aa2021cb9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1067737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Page","original_name":"Paul Page","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/rfxPc4PpYozGJp8UQ8B4RldmGdn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Edwards","credit_id":"5a807cb6c3a368189f0206b8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Catlett","original_name":"Walter Catlett","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/c5ldUlcqrUuxpQE9iXqj9GlRZwt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Master of Ceremonies","credit_id":"5a807cc4925141410101fbb3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilka Chase","original_name":"Ilka Chase","popularity":0.1349,"profile_path":"/yjhLeqn62NAWSmFtpJYJWwzoofL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Comedienne","credit_id":"5a807ccc925141410a01f647","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Millard Webb","original_name":"Millard Webb","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/xkpQl5A7INZ73kjZy7NXSEnSk17.jpg","credit_id":"5a807c68c3a3681895020d10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Davis","original_name":"Aaron Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7f09d0e0a26363900d064","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marion Orth","original_name":"Marion Orth","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7f0aa92514109f300bfb5","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153282,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harold Atteridge","original_name":"Harold Atteridge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7f0bbc3a36829c200dc0c","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0020925","wikidata_id":"Q48674160","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mnakG9pxkfplK1s0N7NOlK7dnqV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wIM7RJLYVkOdj2lxT7zaRYCsfgR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14818,"name":"model"},{"id":164754,"name":"bohemian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
