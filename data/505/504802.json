Although today's one million nuns outnumber priests two to one, they must struggle to be heard by the all-male Roman Catholic hierarchy from which they are excluded. Behind the Veil: Nuns is the first film ever to record from a global perspective the turbulent history and remarkable achievements of women in religion, from pre-Christian Celtic communities to the radical sisters of the 1980s. Contemporary nuns of strength, dignity and commitment speak of their lives and of their predecessors.","popularity":0.2092,"poster_path":"/xpj4outu5djrHkUlSkNtfbDegOF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio D
