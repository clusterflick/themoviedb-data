Based on a stage play, this DV feature traces the poignant trajectory of a rebel whose dream of world revolution first landed him in battles against British colonialism in the 70s, and later on his deathbed in the mid-90s, in agonies over the uncertain fate of a revitalized China. Revealing a little-known chapter of rebellion and idealism, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WU ZHONG XIAN is a timely, resonant docu-drama for today's Hong Kong, China, and our ideologically-disillusioned era.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":"/cAo7u6795H7kyvZQzXQutR4yfFf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riverdrive Productions","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":100937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asian People's Theatre Festival Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2003-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life and Times of Wu Zhong Xian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mok Chiu-Yu","original_name":"Mok Chiu-Yu","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Wu Zhongxian (Ng Chung-yin)","credit_id":"5a82234c925141167500641c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evans Chan","original_name":"陳耀成","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a82235b0e0a267f350072ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77704,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"O Sing-Pui","original_name":"柯星沛","popularity":0.2076,"profile_path":"/eOPrLtzbROCubUfejdeDxqAJwfD.jpg","credit_id":"5a82238392514116720066c5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evans Chan","original_name":"陳耀成","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a82238dc3a3684cd80068d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969094,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gill Wong","original_name":"Gill Wong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a822398c3a3684cd80068dd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977169,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Huie","original_name":"John Huie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8223a5c3a3684ce20065c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969094,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gill Wong","original_name":"Gill Wong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8223b60e0a267f37006e1b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66005,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"William Fung Kwun-Man","original_name":"William Fung Kwun-Man","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a822408c3a3684ce2006608","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mok Chiu-Yu","original_name":"Mok Chiu-Yu","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8224210e0a267f37006e7a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":126517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willy Tsao","original_name":"Willy Tsao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a822436c3a3684cf1006ca7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cAo7u6795H7kyvZQzXQutR4yfFf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lFOlFBe60j2HAqwTPmABavRpu85.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2003-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
