The film is a remake of Ladislao Vajda's 1955 film of the same title, about a boy brought up by monks and encountering Divinity. The story revolves around Marcelino, an orphan abandoned as a baby on the steps of a monastery in nineteenth-century Spain. The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a rowdy young boy. He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a \"very big man who will take him away\" lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the man and tears off back down the stairs.","popularity":0.4272,"poster_path":"/dgb6LY7vhQoZhrNAB7tT30jfBzX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miracle of Marcelino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romnick Sarmenta","original_name":"Romnick Sarmenta","popularity":0.4071,"profile_path":"/lH183dNVqJx9Or6jwTzgDLZHdf4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marcelino","credit_id":"5a7dc1cc0e0a2654e900029d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janice de Belen","original_name":"Janice de Belen","popularity":0.5084,"profile_path":"/1FSDnC4RviNJkNVCoe3oABKm9A0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6040efe635818f005b3343eb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario O'Hara","original_name":"Mario O'Hara","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/ylFSXxPNEkAR41mnugGBn2gUziC.jpg","credit_id":"5a7dc128c3a36817b900024f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José María Sánchez Silva","original_name":"José María Sánchez Silva","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040f0302fe2fa002ba95249","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0406057","wikidata_id":"Q11767422","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dgb6LY7vhQoZhrNAB7tT30jfBzX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lyw6RYD35gL6twhR1JyaZH4qAcC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
