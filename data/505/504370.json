After getting her heart crushed in a relationship, a woman writes a letter to the man she loves for a simple reason—to evoke his empathy towards her. Knowing the premise of human emotions, the woman starts her letter with her own life stories, follows with a blunt confession of affection, and ends with a cursing when she can’t handle the emotions anymore.","popularity":0.1725,"poster_path":"/wZ1mDrAa8zH8SP1OlmuCxsw3tpu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EMPATHY (a digital love letter)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qiyue Sun","original_name":"Qiyue Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7f5bbec3a36818a7012556","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qiyue Sun","original_name":"Qiyue Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7f5bc5925141410a011486","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qiyue Sun","original_name":"Qiyue Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7f5bcc0e0a262aa9012a05","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6673658","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qrQWcFFsaVcHfJNH64a1Knii1hu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wZ1mDrAa8zH8SP1OlmuCxsw3tpu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":159472,"name":"computer screen"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"San Diego Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
