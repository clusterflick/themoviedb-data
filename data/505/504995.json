Historically Pernambuco state in the country’s northeast was characterised agriculturally by the sugarcane industry. Today there is a new sector in the economy: various evangelical Christian groups are on the rise. The mantra of the evangelicals, who have gained an ever-increasing influence in Brazilian society over the past years, is the attainment of improvements in one’s personal and economic situations through adherence to an extreme religious practice. In Brazil the evangelicals have established themselves as a growing political power over the past years. They control segments of the media and preach hate and intolerance towards homosexuality and other creeds. HOLY TREMOR focuses on a young generation of priests, producers and singers who hail from a rural area and make gospel music. Wagner and de Burca take into account the environment of the protagonists in order to make ethics, morality and life visible in an aesthetic agglomeration.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/3ItehOBg29P8KT1vWaWgcfwjHge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holy Tremor","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Terremoto Santo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin de Burca","original_name":"Benjamin de Burca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tDTltE25fdexpKZsXdgMxey1MJV.jpg","credit_id":"5a82e3aa9251411675010fc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1760807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bárbara Wagner","original_name":"Bárbara Wagner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uddU5jo38aX004PJ6MUtWgseDb8.jpg","credit_id":"5a82e3b5c3a3684ce9010081","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016215,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Sotero","original_name":"Pedro Sotero","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b532001c3a3680b5600f152","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029923,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eduardo Serrano","original_name":"Eduardo Serrano","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/aOC2m0knltMEfcux6Kk8S5JN7Xd.jpg","credit_id":"5b53201c0e0a26231700f719","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949997,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolau Domingues","original_name":"Nicolau Domingues","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b53204dc3a3680b6c00e9c1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2246166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecília da Fonte","original_name":"Cecília da Fonte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81c751f3e60003d53d0e8","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2246166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecília da Fonte","original_name":"Cecília da Fonte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81c80cee481003f2bfdcf","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2246166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecília da Fonte","original_name":"Cecília da Fonte","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81c88e18b97003f8f03ea","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2518133,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Sá","original_name":"Carlos Sá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81c9ac7176d003e78da1d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1409990,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dani Vilela","original_name":"Dani Vilela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81cb54d0e8d003f7b3076","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin de Burca","original_name":"Benjamin de Burca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tDTltE25fdexpKZsXdgMxey1MJV.jpg","credit_id":"5fe81cc71d6c5f003fe39744","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1409990,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dani Vilela","original_name":"Dani Vilela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81cd44d0e8d003c7b8b33","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949997,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolau Domingues","original_name":"Nicolau Domingues","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81ce7489d00003f9a77aa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949997,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolau Domingues","original_name":"Nicolau Domingues","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe81cf21d3563003ed986aa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1417034,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guga S.
