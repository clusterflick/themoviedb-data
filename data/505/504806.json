A favorite of Emperor Augustus, Sebastian's devotion to Christ eventually drives him to reject the Emperor's love, causing the Emperor to angrily order Sebastian to be shot with arrows by his fellow archers. The film retells this mystery play with a definite 'art-house' approach: an almost poetical use of language, singing, dancing, some homoerotic themes, and some special effects.","popularity":0.7788,"poster_path":"/kfXZN4JnWl2dtBCONzJrasQwfYK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28353,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV
