None other than Comedian Tyler Boeh, who shifted his focus from singing a Capella (a word he describes as Latin for “Without Girlfriend”) when he won a comedy contest in Portland Oregon. After winning and placing in the finals of numerous Comedy Competitions from San Francisco to Seattle to Boston to The World Series of Comedy, Boeh not only launched a great career in comedy including television appearances, colleges, cruise ships and headlining clubs, he also found a girlfriend.  Tyler’s comedy CD was chosen by LaughSpin Magazine as the Best Comedy Album of 2012 and you may have seen him on such shows as Celebrity Name Game, Moms Rule, Nesn Comedy All Stars, or heard him on SIRIUS radio. Don’t miss a chance to see Tyler live!","popularity":0.0858,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91789,"logo_path":"/vewmadL3CfwSGtwszA1Y58cVmyg.png","name":"VidAngel Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tyler Boeh: Wait For It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Boeh","original_name":"Tyler Boeh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb9a8529251412577f2a63c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Halasima","original_name":"Isaac Halasima","popularity":0.0565,"profile_path":"/8nhN7lEQCtv2YGMIxEvHHfkmOu0.jpg","credit_id":"5cb9a8680e0a26105aece951","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
