It looks like a futuristic sculpture, but we\r find that it is actually a scientific instrument.\r The film follows, step by step, the restoration of a 1950 particle accelerator at the Museo\r Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia in Milan. We observe the restoration of the\r materials, surfaces, and valves, to the recovery of memories and gestures. It is a collective\r rite: restorers, curators, former users of the machine work to transform a \"thing\" taken\r from the everyday life of the laboratory into a museum \"object,\" the guardian of several\r stories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maneggiare con cura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
