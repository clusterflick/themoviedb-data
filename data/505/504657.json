The selected films, Polar Bear, Passers-By, Bulrushes, Fountain, Girls, Ferris Wheel, Airplanes II, Falling Water, Under the Water Lilies, Weybridge and Fireworks, are a small sample of her large body of work which now includes over 200 Super 8 films. Helga Fanderl uses a shoot and cut technique where the act of perceiving and filming are one and the same. There is no post shot editing involved, everything is done in the camera. The films show whatâ€™s happening in front of the camera as well as the simultaneous logical process of its transformation by using the chronology of the event as cinematographic writing.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fM94714Y1zJv9iyDmKfZa1rRItj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FRAGIL(E)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helga Fanderl","original_name":"Helga Fanderl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vXREa4Xs02C4Pt7OdMTtJA9g8Sm.jpg","credit_id":"5a80dd880e0a262ab2029265","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fM94714Y1zJv9iyDmKfZa1rRItj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
