After living in a monastery in Brittany for 20 years, he left for South India with the objective of bringing the best of Christian monastic life with him. To achieve his goal, he believed it important to first open himself to the spiritual heart of India. In doing so he encountered Ramana Maharshi, one of the great sages of his time, at the foot of the sacred mountain Arunachala. The impact of this meeting on him was so powerful that Le Saux’s initial plan was turned upside down. In the presence of this mystical mountain, and its Sage, Le Saux began a spiritual adventure that would lead to his own rebirth.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/wqDGoUywobuOsTgVACjtZMPvNRJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solars Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn of the Abyss: The Spiritual Birth of Swamiji","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrice Blée","original_name":"Fabrice Blée","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5395ebf31f201ccbd6c8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrice Blée","original_name":"Fabrice Blée","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5398c021cee011c8fbab4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7891486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wqDGoUywobuOsTgVACjtZMPvNRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18256,"name":"spiritual"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
