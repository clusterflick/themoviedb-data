Conrad Veidt stars as sinister Egyptian Mahmoud Baroundi, who even before the film gets under way has left a long trail of ruined women behind him. His latest victim is American girl Mona Chepstow (Mary Ellis), whom Baroundi treats like dirt and makes her like it. The plot centers around a murder by poison, as evidenced by the film's deliberately exotic title. Critics in 1934 praised newcomer Mary Ellis for underplaying her role, but many film fans preferred Nazimova's arm-waving histrionics in the earlier version.","popularity":0.4395,"poster_path":"/lLmnBgr46z9JJi1tanbN2eEdFsy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Julius Hagen Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bella Donna","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":960288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Ellis","original_name":"Mary Ellis","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/hFDjA0LgBrFLDEwJah7yt7m9CXD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mary Chepstow Amine","credit_id":"5a8082c10e0a262aac02331c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Stuart","original_name":"John Stuart","popularity":0.2048,"profile_path":"/j8j6VrLDNbezpBmbs8MlIAZKI5A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nigel Armine","credit_id":"5a8082ca0e0a262aa6022ac6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cedric Hardwicke","original_name":"Cedric Hardwicke","popularity":0.7143,"profile_path":"/ypNZBNKlCibI0KsI3GQ1G0xJsQB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Meyer Isaacson","credit_id":"5a8082d9c3a368189a0223e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Veidt","original_name":"Conrad Veidt","popularity":0.4331,"profile_path":"/AkRjkTKXIUoPlczpPegaiFeg4lu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mahmoud Baroudi","credit_id":"5a8082e2925141410d01f010","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1068817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Stuart","original_name":"Jeanne Stuart","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/4iHcfPMD96UCpA6KwjxfmyfGwXm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lady Zoe Harwich","credit_id":"5a8082f39251414101020248","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Millington","original_name":"Rodney Millington","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ibrahim Achmed","credit_id":"5a8082f8925141410a01fc90","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve South","original_name":"Eve South","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Dancing Girl","credit_id":"5a808312c3a36818cd01f656","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Shepley","original_name":"Michael Shepley","popularity":0.1446,"profile_path":"/A1Ik7oCRfh1BjMUkFDszlFs93ht.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Baring-Hartley","credit_id":"5a80832292514140fb0201f8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Milton","original_name":"Robert Milton","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a808259c3a36818a702257f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47658,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.
