He is an apathetic bureaucrat in a society without values. He finally learns from his foster father that he has already become the victim of a genetic experiment as an egg cell. The latter has separated Robert's hereditary traits of reason, pleasure and aggression and cut up copies of his egg cell. The emotionally cold Robert is left only with reason, but the late side effects cause his cells to deteriorate. To escape the threat of cell death, he sets out to find his genetic brothers.","popularity":0.3089,"poster_path":"/hr2DJQrEiKlS7mOQoaSc46nzMBy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cut Character - Tödliche Trennung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Cut Charakter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Roebers","original_name":"Bernd Roebers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62d468e72ea6b9004fc166c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Lenzen","original_name":"Stephan Lenzen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62d468f0a217c0004db163dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Bentzin","original_name":"Kai Bentzin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62d468f8194186005412a3aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Comelli","original_name":"Gerhard Comelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62d46904cb30840050567b16","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Lengert","original_name":"Alfred Lengert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62d4691c66f2d20067f750e1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Lenzen","original_name":"Stephan Lenzen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d469652dffd8004fc0ad97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Lenzen","original_name":"Stephan Lenzen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4697d5aba320067c159f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Manglitz","original_name":"Thomas Manglitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4698efa4046007111473d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3627753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Manglitz","original_name":"Thomas Manglitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d46995e6d3cc004dfafbfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1812298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Hülsbeck","original_name":"Chris Hülsbeck","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d469b8c92c5d004c2ad6f7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2701,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/hr2DJQrEiKlS7mOQoaSc46nzMBy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1801},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6EbXTzRyIGhqmsOeTqBRlUdCHgp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/q3QAlglEfIuOVw9LxY2I1FHtwpj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":223823,"name":"no budget"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Jugendvideopreis 1993","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
