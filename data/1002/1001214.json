The movie is a borderline between documentary and performance; during preparations for the evening drag show performers talk about the need for auto-expression, what “drag” means to them, and stereotypes rumored about them. As a definition “drag” is an exaggeration of feminity or masculinity, emotions, features, or behaviors not appearing in daily life but there is no one definition of what drag really is. During the intimate conversations they share their struggles, doubts and stories told completely with “no make-up”, through the prism of which we think we know them.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/kZqMUnQFkR4f2FnUQzwsvOOI5uo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Makeup","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131258,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Monika Konarzewska","original_name":"Monika Konarzewska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4bd655aba32004cd6341b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5119917,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lukasz Chrusciel","original_name":"Lukasz Chrusciel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abe2e8e09d6c9190b08d5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21906964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/39d0Fe9wXIe5bnXuVKqrje5R8aO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kZqMUnQFkR4f2FnUQzwsvOOI5uo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9NX6ynDtV70TfSiCUBUkB4oCvud.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
