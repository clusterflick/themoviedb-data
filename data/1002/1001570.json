I am interested in the stories the formations can tell of the co-evolution of life and minerals, of humans and non-humans, and their entanglement with one another and the land. I developed custom software that uses sound waves to augment three-dimensional forms animating the geological landscapes. Oscillations work as an audio-visual metaphor for change across deep time and provide a way to perform across an incomprehensible length of time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fX7oigwNShlWDVuM7nKvxJlQf9U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frequencies of Deep Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Souther","original_name":"Eric Souther","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5e98ad1a893005526708a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fX7oigwNShlWDVuM7nKvxJlQf9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1342}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
