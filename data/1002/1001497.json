The narrative and soundtrack capture that timeless moment where one small decision can make large impacts on navigating the course that takes Hote, a 21 year old bass player, from where he is, to where he wants to be. Sometimes these choices lead to dissonance while other times they bring him in tune with the universe. For Hote, life is like composing that perfect Rock n' Roll song where each new note or chord along the way can bring you closer, or farther away, from the intended destination. It is important to enjoy the journey by staying in motion so you don't get stuck.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/vrwDlVxzv3G8VLbIzHpZ7EvjEy5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stuck Outside of Phoenix","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2993392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9u6UvBo9DYorA2f2yq5fR7b6Qwt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vrwDlVxzv3G8VLbIzHpZ7EvjEy5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
