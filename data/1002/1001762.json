The films have been directed by a selection of young directors and blend existing Shakespeare's Globe footage with new material shot in locations that capture the breadth of the Bard's imagination, including the Pyramids of Dahshur in Egypt, the rocks of Elsinore, Denmark, and the historic Jewish Ghetto of Venice, Italy. “Cymbeline”, which starred Hayley Atwell as Innogen, was filmed on location in Wales.","popularity":0.344,"poster_path":"/aX7MPzHrskh5usos7rnPCp0KZkf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shakespeare's Globe invites the world to join The Complete Walk.","title":"The Complete Walk: Cymbeline","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayley Atwell","original_name":"Hayley Atwell","popularity":4.3147,"profile_path":"/jm5pDDjsbgizhxSd7baDxbGYMtW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Innogen","credit_id":"62d6a74250733c004c1461dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Harvey","original_name":"Kevin Harvey","popularity":4.4669,"profile_path":"/iCoXqgY8cENDHiWv2ka7ZhLZtZV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pisanio","credit_id":"62d6a75a048638004e02fb14","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Yates","original_name":"Sam Yates","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6a7a3e6d3cc0055c5048a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Yates","original_name":"Sam Yates","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6a7bd72c13e06301ef4d0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672845,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Lusk","original_name":"Jessica Lusk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62df309e1a32480051914d09","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"64c38829af6e9400e3c6cb09","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6313186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wgLfBzE9exTfdEEyL8YHQ4mZpPN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aX7MPzHrskh5usos7rnPCp0KZkf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
