But on the eve of the competition, seemingly having lost all shooting prowess, Max allows himself to be convinced by his rival Kaspar to make a pact with the devil to use seven magic bullets which never miss their target.  Wagner said that Carl Maria von Weber’s early-Romantic gem was the most German of German operas.  With touches of the eerie supernatural, Der Freischütz is an irresistible mix of colourful folklore, tender romance, and a passionate struggle between good and evil - all captured in Weber’s tuneful and dramatic score. Successful Russian theatre, opera and film director Kirill Serebrennikov makes his debut in Amsterdam. In his approach to the opera, the struggle for success is transposed from the world of hunters and that of artists.","popularity":0.3827,"poster_path":"/vQIW3zG53UFnqAhdkm3ZTTEJMiu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marksman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wilmering","original_name":"Michael Wilmering","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62d6948f50733c004f5f8941","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Platt","original_name":"James Platt","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62d6949672c13e062e71e720","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanni van Oostrum","original_name":"Johanni van Oostrum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62d6949d50733c004f5f8951","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2771399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ying Fang","original_name":"Ying Fang","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/8u14g3fZNaZOl0miaGQiLImOXxx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62d694a41f3e60096304b381","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Groissböck","original_name":"Günther Groissböck","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/dEynH6fOflbYc0wwO3cnZ8CtMZa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62d694ab72c13e062e71e731","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Bruns","original_name":"Benjamin Bruns","popularity":0.0401,"profile_path":"/nVU1u5tBxfWRsUWydSGNMzZ5xjm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62d694b4a410c80691fc9f40","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Hahn","original_name":"Patrick Hahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62d694bc50733c004f5f897e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odin Lund Biron","original_name":"Один Ланд Байрон","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/3wyVQKbirrCyRdAhVPN74vZXGJT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64aad7e1d1a89300c57599c1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Hahn","original_name":"Patrick Hahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d694dca410c80691fc9f57","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Serebrennikov","original_name":"Kirill Serebrennikov","popularity":0.2299,"profile_path":"/csxQOPUf3xoew4lEjXiWgFRWJV7.jpg","credit_id":"664b40a5c98e01d3cd547298","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vQIW3zG53UFnqAhdkm3ZTTEJMiu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
