Conclusion: no longer employable. Wasn’t the Hungarian from Lake Balaton aiming high? What now? Continue to be on his successful wife’s back? László slips into a real life crisis and initially finds solace in the fascinating attraction of a “crazy woman” from the neighbouring village. But when a right-wing populist stands as the only candidate for mayor in the village of 120 souls, László comes to his senses. In order to “prevent the right-wing idiot”, he puts himself forward as a liberal counter-candidate.\r The only question that remains is whether László’s marriage and he himself will survive the village election campaign?","popularity":0.6479,"poster_path":"/Ancy3oai0Tn681Tgj52XbJRU2es.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surviving Brandenburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Über Leben in Brandenburg","type":"Festivaltitel"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Überleben in Brandenburg","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"About Living in Brandenburg","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joachim Paul Assböck","original_name":"Joachim Paul Assböck","popularity":0.2834,"profile_path":"/dR5xVd4z7LtkUwpLn9ks92z1cqU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Weidland","credit_id":"62d5975404b596004f017b85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László I.
