It presents pictures illustrating the history of Poland in chronological order: portraits of rulers and magnates, historical events, such as uprisings, but also balls, hunting, concerts, from the Middle Ages to the present day. In just twenty and a few minutes, the exhibition's message was captured - the heritage of the centuries and the image of the historically changing Polish identity.","popularity":0.0539,"poster_path":"/dX3CXP21Q2tUx9D0GcSAnYod0Is.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Are You?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kwiatkowska","original_name":"Maria Kwiatkowska","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d69466e6d3cc0055c4fb34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wiesława Dembińska","original_name":"Wiesława Dembińska","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6daba6c84d600547298c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Waldemar Walczak","original_name":"Waldemar Walczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6dac672c13e062e7205d9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138218,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zygmunt Konieczny","original_name":"Zygmunt Konieczny","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/9PFxgJJIOErQnvtBiZD48QASIQL.jpg","credit_id":"62d6dad0d1a8930f108386a7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kwiatkowska","original_name":"Maria Kwiatkowska","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6da36e6d3cc0055c51af7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090709,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ludmila Godziaszwili","original_name":"Ludmila Godziaszwili","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6da9a048638005377de29","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Krzysztof Pakulski","original_name":"Krzysztof Pakulski","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6da48e93e95095def857c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wlada Dabrowska","original_name":"Wlada Dabrowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6dadf048638005377de48","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dX3CXP21Q2tUx9D0GcSAnYod0Is.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
