The Belgian composer Wim Henderickx and librettist Krystian Lada have created a new opera from Stefan Hertmans' haunting novel about identity, impossible love, faith and human strength. Western early music, modernism and film music merge with Jewish and Arab traditions to create a contemporary opera in which Vigdis' epic story is told through sound. Koen Kessels tackles the challenge of conducting not only the Orchestra, Chorus and Children’s Chorus of Opera Ballet Vlaanderen, but also a cast with singers from different vocal traditions, instrumentalists who play the qanûn, duduk or oud, and a newly formed city choir made up of Antwerp citizens from diverse backgrounds.","popularity":0.0803,"poster_path":"/6Nvq1S0SWytbVvdrib8dIxdm9Gf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Convert - HENDERICKX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lore Binon","original_name":"Lore Binon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62d68cbd50733c004f5f84cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Neri","original_name":"Vincenzo Neri","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62d68cc5d1a8930f1083646d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2374825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amel Brahim-Djelloul","original_name":"Amel Brahim-Djelloul","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62d68ccc50733c004f5f84db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Atlan","original_name":"Françoise Atlan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62d68cd4048638004bcbc6d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Arnaldos","original_name":"Daniel Arnaldos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62d68cdd50733c004f5f84ec","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Op de Beeck","original_name":"Hans Op de Beeck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d68cf5e6d3cc0055c4f725","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193766,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Koen Kessels","original_name":"Koen Kessels","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/2iGNEX7vjJPaysZggWEW6YafkdZ.jpg","credit_id":"62d68cead1a8930f10836487","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4825284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefan Hertmans","original_name":"Stefan Hertmans","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6690e9ba118e39786cd99e85","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Nvq1S0SWytbVvdrib8dIxdm9Gf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
