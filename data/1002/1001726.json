An unexpected affair instigates an explosive metamorphosis, and she finds perfect release as a tree. But the world is a dangerous place for trees, and deep in the forest a forester and a student lay claim to a body of wood and leaf - one for money and one for love.  A subversion of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Like flesh is the fruit of a collaboration between a group of committed young artists. The Israeli composer Sivan Eldar creates an intriguing  sound world by combining orchestral and electro-acoustic music. The British playwright Cordelia Lynn is already well known in English theatre circles for, among other things, her collaboration with Katie Mitchell to re-stage The Tempest.","popularity":0.1882,"poster_path":"/3spLnsglOO005lI5kKgIRT7fvNf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like flesh - ELDAR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Rasker","original_name":"Helena Rasker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690c8e6d3cc0055c4f949","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dazeley","original_name":"William Dazeley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690cfe93e95095cbe26c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Angelo","original_name":"Juliette Angelo","popularity":0.6073,"profile_path":"/rnmMm0ORpt3tyjDt5tjjVygjfVH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690d8048638004e02f018","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adèle Carlier","original_name":"Adèle Carlier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690e11f3e60096304b19d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Fauchère","original_name":"Hélène Fauchère","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690eb1f3e600964127c35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guilhem Terrail","original_name":"Guilhem Terrail","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690f4c92c5d004f0d64d1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Clayton","original_name":"Sean Clayton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62d690fbd1a8930f0f53dba7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Ramos Premier","original_name":"René Ramos Premier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62d69106d1a8930f1083669a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3629705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florent Baffi","original_name":"Florent Baffi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62d6910de6d3cc0055c4f976","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662000,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Silvia Costa","original_name":"Silvia Costa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d691295aba320067c27412","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148303,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxime Pascal","original_name":"Maxime Pascal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6911ae6d3cc004dfc3910","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3spLnsglOO005lI5kKgIRT7fvNf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
