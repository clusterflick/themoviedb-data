Morris simply dictated instructions for the making of the film. Despite this conceptual origin, it is also an essentially cinematic ‘performance’, exploiting slow motion, tight framing and an implicit analogy between the transparent glass door against which the figure pushes, and the screen or image surface. The repetitions and variations, the use of gesture, weight and force, give the performance a dance-like gravity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nvCNnPrrXKcJ6BEKP9QVyuds4L3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow Motion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1874626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Morris","original_name":"Robert Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d443c05aba32004cd5fb48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nvCNnPrrXKcJ6BEKP9QVyuds4L3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a37MmOFRRH93sgtrE3pwzMQufFm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
