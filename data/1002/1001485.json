Workers of industrial enterprises of the Dnipropetrovsk region and residents of nearby areas filmed working days and emergencies on their gadgets. Heavy everyday life is complemented by flashes of non-triviality. However, such videos and their proliferation on the Internet are evidence of an ongoing class war (the use of recording devices at work is generally strictly prohibited). The directors have retained the original voice acting, which is distinguished by a bright emotional coloring, a mixture of surprise and delight. Scenes of (post)industrial hell alternate with unexpected situations of humor and humanity.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/8jts94PKvXEvF8bHTQoFoHB6dwf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labor Safety in the Region of Dnipropetrovsk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","original_name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5ae90d1a893004dbccb11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","original_name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5aef950733c004f5f1615","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","original_name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5aedf04863800537748f5","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","original_name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5af0a04b596004f018419","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","original_name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5ae98a410c80055dbefe4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","original_name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5aee772c13e06301e871b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","original_name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5aea22ac499053d1e3832","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","original_name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5aead435abd0050cd939d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","original_name":"Daniil Revkovskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5aed650733c0054c5d96e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","original_name":"Andriy Rachinskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d5ae84a410c8004db65fc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21254988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8jts94PKvXEvF8bHTQoFoHB6dwf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Marseille International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"informal year date","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
