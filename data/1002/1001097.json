It was commissioned to be based on the book of the same name on the history of the Filipino people. The book’s author is credited as the authoritarian and then-President Ferdinand Marcos, but was actually ghostwritten by other historians. The film presents a satirical, humorous and poignant view of the Philippines’ history of Spanish colonisation through highly original and surreal vignettes fusing art, mythology and music. Several artists collaborated, voiced characters and appear in the film. Noted printmaker Pandy Aviado served as the film’s assistant director while Santiago Bose was one of the film’s many animators.","popularity":0.0499,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first full-length Philippine animated film directed by Nonoy Marcelo.","title":"Tadhana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nonoy Marcelo","original_name":"Nonoy Marcelo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d46bc8f1759c004f340dfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
