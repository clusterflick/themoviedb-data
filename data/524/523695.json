He betrayed all those who loved him, exchanged a happy family life for vegetation in poverty in an abandoned cellar, whispered to the whole of humanity with its morals and foundations and challenged God. He wanted to proudly call himself an artist and draw pictures that to this day no one has ever seen.  The story of the hero's life, narrated in three chapters from birth to death, turns into a metaphysical quest and test of the spirit, a global revelation of what life is.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/r6FP4mQslzRSeK1jCzuiK2l0zSv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winterborn Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fedor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Фёдор","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fyodor","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fedor Oganesov","original_name":"Fedor Oganesov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5af5569ac3a3682a5d005c53","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Oganesov","original_name":"Иван Оганесов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wLYySr2FnegTjNAVSeqfop1SAHn.jpg","credit_id":"5af557280e0a264251003575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Oganesov","original_name":"Иван Оганесов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wLYySr2FnegTjNAVSeqfop1SAHn.jpg","credit_id":"5af557580e0a2642570036d6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Oganesov","original_name":"Иван Оганесов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wLYySr2FnegTjNAVSeqfop1SAHn.jpg","credit_id":"5af5575d9251415147003d7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040513,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexandr Polishchuk","original_name":"Alexandr Polishchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af5577c0e0a26425100358c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040514,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mikhail Mikadze","original_name":"Mikhail Mikadze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af557ddc3a3682a660022ba","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040515,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergey Chebotarev","original_name":"Sergey Chebotarev","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af55821925141514d001dab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3816044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"fyodorfilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/bnc0qUO5KqcLhzUqzESE8HixYz2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/5uopZljUJFs4dl3YOcMVVD4E2lA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/rMycXaWmWngLtWSdPb7AE0iFf4F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/2tLxsJp7htc9FxBhnKAh9AUdt7z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/r6FP4mQslzRSeK1jCzuiK2l0zSv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1273,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/mhJZBdV6q32D7JJsPSncKK0orZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pärnu International Documentary and Anthropology Film Festival","release_date":"2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
