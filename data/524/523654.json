It is Mary Woronov’s showcase piece, in which she metes out physical and psychological abuse to Susan Bottomly, Angelina “Pepper” Davis, and Ingrid Superstar in a room at the Chelsea Hotel. At first, the cast tries to accurately adhere to Tavel’s scenario, but by reel two it all falls apart—the performers begin to use their real names and exhibit a sort of residual stress disorder that permeates the rest of the film.","popularity":0.5563,"poster_path":"/xig2S7RVfuotc0I5myw8OZ05l36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen of China (Hanoi Hanna)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Woronov","original_name":"Mary Woronov","popularity":0.2959,"profile_path":"/mcMv4FKAoMlfrrJL8Wet8vzy4gw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5af5155f0e0a2642570018b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Superstar","original_name":"Ingrid Superstar","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5af5156892514150fc001d1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelina 'Pepper' Davis","original_name":"Angelina 'Pepper' Davis","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5af51577c3a3682a75001862","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"International Velvet","original_name":"International Velvet","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/vu0gRBURgPgdMFuuXvlIdUbXKNW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d644dd2813cb60014f8a05c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"5af5159c0e0a264259001a07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xig2S7RVfuotc0I5myw8OZ05l36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":14529,"name":"improvisation"},{"id":166514,"name":"underground film"},{"id":221547,"name":"chelsea hotel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
