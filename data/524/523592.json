Warhol superstar Taylor Mead is also featured, in the role of a CIA agent. “The film was partly underwritten by Andy Warhol, who gave a check to cover lab fees. \"Dialogue...\" was seldom shown in the States - it is entirely in Spanish - but had some life in the European screens. It had a modest run at the Cinémathèque Française, where it was championed by Marie Meerson and Henri Langlois, and played at the Berlin Film Festival in 1969. Historically, it has been shown with two prints projected side by side, the second screen starting with a 3-minute delay.\r --Film-Makers Coop","popularity":0.1263,"poster_path":"/hyX6Sjznx0gczMXmLqL5qvJimkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogue with Che","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolando Peña","original_name":"Rolando Peña","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/aP6KnDOqbNYVynnYf552WygNXW8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5f8a5069d2804142004978","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Mead","original_name":"Taylor Mead","popularity":0.3096,"profile_path":"/5UHc1T7cTParS6sfYKD3WBht2rW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5f8a3069d280124dff93ea","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Rodriguez-Soltero","original_name":"José Rodriguez-Soltero","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af4b3c99251412b870015eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9897832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tb45ZOvM0JmqYqjumuy9CGgxfL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":845,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hyX6Sjznx0gczMXmLqL5qvJimkA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
