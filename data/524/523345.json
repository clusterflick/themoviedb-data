He rehearses new plays, is shot by young directors. It is not assigned to any theater, it does not belong to any group. It exists by itself, suddenly appearing on one or another scene.  The film is a unique experience of documentary observation of an actor for several years. The basis of the plot is rehearsals of one role in the performance of the St. Petersburg Youth Theater \"Wine from dandelions, or Zamri.\" The process of the birth of a character is no less exciting and interesting than the performance itself. Around the main \"rehearsal\" story - episodes from life, stories about childhood against the background of their own drawings, paintings.","popularity":0.1111,"poster_path":"/p9TFXKqVVwerDem0zNCCk3z1Y3u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreiden Suite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Dreyden-syuita","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Dreyden","original_name":"Сергей Дрейден","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/2pGZRqmyPMAdt8pKVyXAy66TwKb.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5af31617925141066f00bbba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2039462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Nepevny","original_name":"Vladimir Nepevny","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/cs1rpPvzzn1KcoIX3IGcpZDiCEO.jpg","credit_id":"5af3167bc3a36855c700a73b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2039462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Nepevny","original_name":"Vladimir Nepevny","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/cs1rpPvzzn1KcoIX3IGcpZDiCEO.jpg","credit_id":"5af316860e0a26688900aed8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/4CfZcf2Zl9cyQQx0fifgJcyHyVE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/9vnORZ9111nYZCkLQnBbt1SMljY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/18mXngFpECDFHrHhj6cU8geYIiC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/kmmQpOsYE0w4b12KxTedgNnGDFo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/p9TFXKqVVwerDem0zNCCk3z1Y3u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"International Festival-Practice of Film Schools \"Kinoproba\"","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
