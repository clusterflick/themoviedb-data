An old woman, guided by her visions, discovers a Byzantine religious icon buried in a field. Her nephew sells the find to a thief, who then murders the old woman, without knowing that she had told the village priest about the holy icon she found. Two priests arrive in the village together with the puppeteer and his ailing wife, and there the wife sees a vision of the icon and where it was located in the field, which leads to the discovery of the bones of a saint. The wife sleeps on the spot where the holy relics were discovered and, upon awaking the following morning, regains her speech.","popularity":0.1656,"poster_path":"/11YdufA0qtj7Qvhk03dSyq7OF00.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/hDJO96mUfqtB9ia7ef7mEvguPxl.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1987-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terirem","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Terirem","type":"Title with Latin characters"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonis Kafetzopoulos","original_name":"Αντώνης Καφετζόπουλος","popularity":0.2398,"profile_path":"/suBwnu35QJAbSgIe7tZrl1D2w2g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kostas Kavvadias","credit_id":"5ceea2370e0a261bbbd4098f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1617518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olia Lazaridou","original_name":"Όλια Λαζαρίδου","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":"/poHeMObqHGGsKcX2qejSyz1Jwkv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maria Kavvadia","credit_id":"5ceea23f0e0a263f4acdb6d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1631532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasia Panagopoulou","original_name":"Βάσια Παναγοπούλου","popularity":0.1584,"profile_path":"/dwjt8BV6tIWoG5qU58HKMqXmrDB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"5ceea2510e0a2615b5cadaf9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":376765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Poulikakos","original_name":"Δημήτρης Πουλικάκος","popularity":0.1699,"profile_path":"/jtNIsgFJJXQ4e1f2shIn7Ae8OFq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"5ceea25992514134d7b95e06","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alkis Panagiotidis","original_name":"Άλκης Παναγιωτίδης","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":"/yJwStYR4rSREjJ90yrQpsOYZCGP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ahilleas","credit_id":"5ceea2629251414398bfed2c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1260440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofocles Peppas","original_name":"Σοφοκλής Πέππας","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/mbd1KinaSq9yKTP8qKT7TPt44X3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leonidas","credit_id":"5ceea26cc3a368441e221dcb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1640849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikos Papakonstantinou","original_name":"Νίκος Παπακωνσταντίνου","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nikodimos","credit_id":"5ceea2789251410fe2b9464b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":447183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spiros Papadopoulos","original_name":"Σπύρος Παπαδόπουλος","popularity":0.5397,"profile_path":"/3WJoiXAMzHQbJeIb23uMdRfCad7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dokimos","credit_id":"5ceea2829251410fe2b94653","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72525,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yorgos Mavropsaridis","original_name":"Γιώργος Μαυροψαρίδης","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/14I99sGV038xGQxHF6qlCAk2fwX.jpg","credit_id":"62df452f481382004fbbfc37","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giorgos Panousopoulos","original_name":"Γιώργος Πανουσόπουλος","popularity":0.1792,"profile_path":"/gXQnN4FoLfdxM01Kmk5y75P7caO.jpg","credit_id":"62df45480d9f5a004cb88e23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260427,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Apostolos Doxiadis","original_name":"Apostolos Doxiadis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af72c140e0a2655b2000cfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260427,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Apostolos Doxiadis","original_name":"Apostolos Doxiadis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceea297c3a368441e221e25","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0124162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":761,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/11YdufA0qtj7Qvhk03dSyq7OF00.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1987-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
