He cleverly tells short stories and jokes that try to get audiences to think but are silly and absurd as well. Cory is a regular in all of the clubs in the Pacific Northwest and has headlined clubs, colleges, casinos, and weird bars all over the country. He didn’t win the 2013 World Series of Comedy (semi-finals), the 2012 Seattle International Comedy Competition (SICC), or the 2014 Tacoma Comedy Contest (2nd) but he took another crack at the SICC and made the 2014 finals.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cory Michaelis:","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
