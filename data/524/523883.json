Outside her daily work she runs a youth center, leads courses and functions as parole officer for young Belem, who has served time in a correctional center. She also takes care of Belem's son, Ray, when Ray's mother is at work. Belem's release from prison coincides with the appearance of an irritatingly nosy economist from the social services head quarters, curious about Marie's impressing but costly work. As pressure mounts, Marie's true feelings rise to the surface and her methods and motives are questioned.","popularity":0.3856,"poster_path":"/tHbO2pvRn0BOfkbgncDPMfRd6zs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trelandsfilm AB","origin_country":""},{"id":104508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmföreningen Fanzingo","origin_country":""},{"id":14632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zingofilm","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2008-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Marie Nord and Her Clients","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Helin","original_name":"Sofia Helin","popularity":0.7042,"profile_path":"/aOzrZ51r9sPAE8sJvQm2LuZ3hYc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"5af6cfce9251413ff200528d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2041211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Gatsinzi","original_name":"Miguel Gatsinzi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Befem","credit_id":"5af6cfe29251413ff200529e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Endeley","original_name":"Jimmy Endeley","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/gVbwnQWfvHNnbKgOqLKKRf0jqCM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The investigator","credit_id":"5af6d002c3a368125a003cf0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309693,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jovanna Remaeus Jönson","original_name":"Jovanna Remaeus Jönson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Line","credit_id":"5af6d01ac3a368126e006be7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2041212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Sandström","original_name":"Victoria Sandström","popularity":0.0548,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jamila","credit_id":"5af6d02c9251414406004ad2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":964973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lykke Li","original_name":"Lykke Li","popularity":0.1996,"profile_path":"/n5hobUvcTAmq4RJyveKrxdfODsp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5af6d04292514144040052da","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Perski","original_name":"Peter Perski","popularity":0.3125,"profile_path":"/4Ix7GSVsUlyVodishpLmlVjEdSk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jonas","credit_id":"5af6d053c3a3681263004d9e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":964973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lykke Li","original_name":"Lykke Li","popularity":0.1996,"profile_path":"/n5hobUvcTAmq4RJyveKrxdfODsp.jpg","credit_id":"5af6d07e0e0a26332d0056a6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Onofri","original_name":"Alexander Onofri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af6d0a30e0a26332d0056bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1889051,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Maria Sohlman Wikman","original_name":"Maria Sohlman Wikman","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af6d0c60e0a261325004690","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2041213,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Axel Lindahl","original_name":"Axel Lindahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af6d074c3a368126c008135","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1649050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Gezelius","original_name":"Kerstin Gezelius","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/9GOS7wKquU8Mfdr5Jcdh7XQB0vU.jpg","credit_id":"5af6d08c92514144040052ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Onofri","original_name":"Alexander Onofri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af6d0ad9251414441004137","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1333632","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/uNonPcbbekQPRRU4H8ZqgXpfE8U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tHbO2pvRn0BOfkbgncDPMfRd6zs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170154,"name":"social services"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
