We must make political films. 2. We must make films politically.’ Mok Chiu-yu’s allusions to Godard’s 1970 ‘What is to be done?’ manifesto are active in his wandering exploration of locations such as Hong Kong’s then newly opened City Hall and Café do Brazil. Punctuated with jump cuts and graphical interventions onto the film strip itself, An Open Letter not only critiques the trappings of intellectual life, but also questions the role of an activist-filmmaker in Hong Kong society.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/473rJtRM1EeHGm8nFgfFX1lvnZm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Open Letter to the Literary Youth in Hong Kong","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mok Chiu-Yu","original_name":"Mok Chiu-Yu","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ce362458efd3006b405b9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/473rJtRM1EeHGm8nFgfFX1lvnZm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
