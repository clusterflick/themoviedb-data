For many people it was a shock. The Empire collapsed, human relations and moral values collapsed. Crime and bandits were everywhere. And ordinary people were concerned about how to survive. This period was called perestroika. The people call this time a troubled time. The film reviews social processes from within, not from the outside propaganda side. Much for the modern spectator seems strange, it seems phantasmagoric, but it was so.” -V.
