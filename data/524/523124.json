As a defender of his people's culture and traditions, he was known as \"Spudwrench\" during the 1990 Oka crisis. Offering a unique look behind the barricades at one man's impassioned defence of sacred territory, the film is both a portrait of Horne and the generations of daring Mohawk construction workers that have preceded him.","popularity":0.3643,"poster_path":"/hik35qFp8PVpcHoJpru6sVawtLB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spudwrench - Kahnawake Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Spudwrench : l'homme de Kahnawake","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"5af214459251410679002c88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"6778586238d26a2a63726591","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":116797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Read","original_name":"Donna Read","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67785898321a3a166a74ad6f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"6778591582cce15a7674b996","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Haig","original_name":"Don Haig","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6778592a5ac1bd8261669bfa","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0131601","wikidata_id":"Q59619051","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hik35qFp8PVpcHoJpru6sVawtLB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":592},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u3QhO6dB1ixOmOsaX0chG8kuJHH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8519,"name":"mohawk"},{"id":164852,"name":"steel worker"},{"id":254729,"name":"ironworker"},{"id":268163,"name":"oka crisis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
