A small 5 year-old boy named Tom, who lives with his single mother, Jill, in New York, has to give up his favorite book; 'The Giraffe That Knew Too Much'-- because it got put on a list of censored books. Not understanding what is going on around him, Tom just wants to hold on to his favorite book, while his mother doesn't want to upset the higher powers. The story is an innocent look at censorship through the eyes of a child.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/by6KhguuoRAGu6yZXHwcwfcnURL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Giraffe Who Knew Too Much","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg MacCary","original_name":"Meg MacCary","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"60b71d17f44f27002944a8be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Guarnieri","original_name":"Jack Guarnieri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"60b71d34dd926a002949d54a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Tosstorff","original_name":"Eric Tosstorff","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b71d56eda4b700599f5a74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2700222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/by6KhguuoRAGu6yZXHwcwfcnURL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
