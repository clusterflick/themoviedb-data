If you look behind the powerful music façade, you find not a story of a band but chronicles of a voyage aimed at incredible, incomparable music. Encore shows how the songs which are now known by heart were composed; it also shows things generally left aside: pieces of everyday life, tour diaries, conversations, including the key phrase: “You should not look at the liberty too much, you might feel dizzy.","popularity":0.3673,"poster_path":"/6a15NHFBKoWznfpSvYNRD2mtOJs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dmitry Lavrinenko
