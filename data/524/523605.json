Qiu Jin boldly challenged traditional gender roles and demanded equal rights and opportunities for women. She was the first woman to lead an armed uprising against the corrupt Qing Dynasty, for which she was arrested and executed. She became the first female martyr for China's 1911 Revolution and is celebrated as a national heroine today.  While Qiu Jin is a familiar figure in China, she is largely unknown outside of the country. AUTUMN GEM is the first documentary feature on Qiu Jin in the U.S. Using scholar interviews, archival materials, and dramatic recreation scenes based on her original writings, AUTUMN GEM brings the story of Qiu Jin to life.","popularity":0.0411,"poster_path":"/opmBljMjOyXyhxT8w88X6xXWHXn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Modern China's First Feminist","title":"Autumn Gem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rae Chang","original_name":"Rae Chang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5df31e8afac50200178301f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Chin","original_name":"Melissa Chin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Young Qiu Jin","credit_id":"5df31e9dfac5020017830220","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3543715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Jing","original_name":"Li Jing","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/n8VLOqVAlnbVW3ok8d3qxDcubFc.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Qiu Jin","credit_id":"627a9b27c433ea0052d22ba1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rae Chung","original_name":"Rae Chung","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31f90d1a893001472a191","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt MacPhail","original_name":"Matt MacPhail","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31fdc0486380014ffc0b2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481488,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Tow","original_name":"Adam Tow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31f55fac502001182dd99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rae Chung","original_name":"Rae Chung","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31f874a4bf6001451b748","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rae Chung","original_name":"Rae Chung","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31f3afac5020017830736","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481489,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Jeanne","original_name":"Jean-Paul Jeanne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31fbe4a4bf6001751eafe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481488,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Tow","original_name":"Adam Tow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31f764a4bf6001252153a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481488,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Tow","original_name":"Adam Tow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df31f68d1a893001272ad2e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1344688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opmBljMjOyXyhxT8w88X6xXWHXn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
