They credit the book to popular author Robert Street, who is completely ignorant about aviation. Robert gets into all sorts of trouble in attempting to carry on the ruse, saving his friend's business but also attracting the attention of aviation-mad Grace Douglas. At first, he is able to carry out simple publicity events, but when he accidentally starts up an aircraft, his incredible aerobatics end with a landing in a haystack. When a race is staged between him and French ace Major Jules Gaillard, it ends with Robert confessing he is no pilot, but still winning Grace's heart. Considered a lost film.","popularity":0.2684,"poster_path":"/5LUTFR2LdWuOc1tqsEAOokOkmrx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
