The people are split between a religious majority, struggling to assert its conservative identity, and a vocal minority determined to make their home in a community afraid of change. Fearing a threat to their way of life, the mayor and city council unanimously approve a resolution. This defines the kind of families they would like to see move in as 'one man, one woman' with a 'full quiver' of children. Natural Family Values is an intimate portrait of a community at odds with itself, and what happens when democracy and theocracy clash.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/MlXzouft1JuNvxoSGDLygQLCkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Natural Family Values explores a small Mormon town that passes a resolution defining the proper gender-roles for its citizens and the community backlash that ensued.","title":"Natural Family Values: A Community Divided","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2040969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Feldman","original_name":"Frank Feldman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af63f5b925141444800126d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1358606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/MlXzouft1JuNvxoSGDLygQLCkR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
