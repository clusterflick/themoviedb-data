Imagine a people who see all life as sacred and the source of their happiness, a place with an abundance of clean and renewable energy, a nation committed to preserving its culture and whose progress is measured by obtaining Gross National Happiness for its people. Where is this Shangri-La? Bhutan. But can a place like Bhutan really exist? Can such ideals be realized? Can this small, geographically isolated country tucked away in the Himalayans truly protect its environment and culture as they open their doors to the West? The answer is rooted in the Bhutanese view of the world, anchored in Buddhism, with the simple message that happiness can only be found by taking the middle path the path that balances the needs of man with the powerful spirits of nature.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/4CXR16E7g08Bflnc5BmiG3fcFOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vendetti Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bhutan: Taking the Middle Path to Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342449,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ann Mortifee","original_name":"Ann Mortifee","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/u036oAfsVNWSwurMZGPQoAiN8im.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5af2523292514106760045f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Horn","original_name":"Paul Horn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5af253c6c3a36855c5002960","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136173,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Hedge","original_name":"Christopher Hedge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5af253d39251410642004368","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2038992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jigme Drukpa","original_name":"Jigme Drukpa","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/yP5lEk1RYh03c0dO7RvsXUCrotU.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5af2546ec3a36855c7004518","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038959,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Wehrheim","original_name":"John Wehrheim","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rUIoJdaCBrU3I630ErdLnORN0v8.jpg","credit_id":"5af252810e0a2668a8004932","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038959,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Wehrheim","original_name":"John Wehrheim","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rUIoJdaCBrU3I630ErdLnORN0v8.jpg","credit_id":"5af2528d0e0a2668a8004937","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323680,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Stone","original_name":"Robert Stone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af252e00e0a2668b50044e5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038988,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Scott Dewar","original_name":"Scott Dewar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af253010e0a2668940045d9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136173,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Hedge","original_name":"Christopher Hedge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af25320c3a36855c9006add","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Vendetti","original_name":"Thomas Vendetti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af252730e0a2668a2004a8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323680,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Stone","original_name":"Robert Stone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af252d40e0a2668a50048e0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038959,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Wehrheim","original_name":"John Wehrheim","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rUIoJdaCBrU3I630ErdLnORN0v8.jpg","credit_id":"5af252b9c3a36855cc007274","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Vendetti","original_name":"Thomas Vendetti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af252ec925141064f0051a5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6845650","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAq5VI6M7lTXyLChfQezOsMo0nL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4CXR16E7g08Bflnc5BmiG3fcFOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
