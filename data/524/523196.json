In the meantime, her baby sister, Natsumi (Rio Kanno), grows up to become a very studious and serious 12-year-old, studying hard at her summer juku (cram school).  When her aunt, a free-spirited photographer (Karie Kahimi), goes missing in South America, her mildly scatter-brained mother (Kaho Minami) and father (Tetsuji Tanaka) go looking for her, leaving the girl, Natsumi, to look after her sleeping sibling, Ai (Rosa Kato). Yes, this is a clear case of child neglect, but Natsumi is such a no-nonsense, responsible type that it seems almost understandable. Soon after Mom and Dad leave, she notices that Ai, incredibly, is up and about, with the body of a woman, but the mind of an 8-year-old.","popularity":0.3859,"poster_path":"/kH29AAFntUZZ8o8P6G0ujptdSm7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ichiban kirei na mizu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Kato","original_name":"加藤ローサ","popularity":0.4525,"profile_path":"/6ifDu5QRBaHCXRPiWGXZT7s0NDS.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5af25b71c3a36855c90070fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rio Kanno","original_name":"菅野莉央","popularity":0.4672,"profile_path":"/5H4tWYZGCex99MYzKO1EZ8CAzUp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5af25b780e0a266889004b6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2039035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karie Kahimi","original_name":"Karie Kahimi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5af25b8292514106420046c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaho Minami","original_name":"南果歩","popularity":0.5047,"profile_path":"/880kV8RgyqmCMUfsQ67XBSmSJQO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5af25b8ac3a36855b800681c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetsushi Tanaka","original_name":"田中哲司","popularity":0.5473,"profile_path":"/9DHDP2thxiholidGe6WKr38suJz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5af25b930e0a26689c0049c2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3385373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renge Ishiyama","original_name":"石山蓮華","popularity":0.1396,"profile_path":"/77OniGoT5QRCxFdDF17SavcRRW9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"651e93d9c50ad200eac0e1f6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Usui","original_name":"Hiroshi Usui","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af25ba9925141067f00375f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239745,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Uiko Miura","original_name":"Uiko Miura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d051e270e0a260eddcb1646","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563940,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Usamaru Furuya","original_name":"兎丸古屋","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d051e07c3a36832f21f3d31","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080844,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Takahiro Tsutai","original_name":"蔦井孝洋","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d051e4fc3a3680a571f5351","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yasushi Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎康史","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67eaa9daaf752a3b24f726a3","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0872002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/kH29AAFntUZZ8o8P6G0ujptdSm7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
