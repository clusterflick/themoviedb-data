In a journey that ends with his first visit to Auschwitz, Simon travels across the Continent to explore how the Holocaust was far more than a Nazi obsession that played out in gas chambers, but a European-wide crime of complicity. From bullets in the Lithuanian lands of his ancestors to bureaucracy in the Netherlands, he reveals how deep-rooted prejudice was weaponised to turn people against their Jewish neighbours. As a moving interview with a survivor reveals, the story of how ‘evil comes step by step’ remains powerfully relevant today.","popularity":0.4695,"poster_path":"/hZNvAd5ccDprQD2Sv3j65C2cajQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51008,"logo_path":"/d7PQ3u8dC63WGhzOhXS4YL3O7ty.png","name":"Oxford Film and Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the most personal and unflinching film of his career, historian Simon Schama confronts the enormity of the Holocaust and the catastrophe experienced by its victims.","title":"Simon Schama: The Road to Auschwitz","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Simon Schama: The Holocaust, 80 Years On","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Schama","original_name":"Simon Schama","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/rKtJWCsJDZjdyvuW78IKkwdhC1H.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"67f4513731c9f27299ad34fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Macgregor","original_name":"Hugo Macgregor","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f45056eddec28b03adba8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jyoti Mehta","original_name":"Jyoti Mehta","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f450698cfccf7bafd92593","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas Kent","original_name":"Nicolas Kent","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f450848cfccf7bafd925a9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064149,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Sacher","original_name":"Charlotte Sacher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f450968cfccf7bafd925ba","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356312,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Hayward","original_name":"Tom Hayward","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f450a58cfccf7bafd925cc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356314,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Wilkinson","original_name":"Richard Wilkinson","popularity":0.0562,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f451268cfccf7bafd92617","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36455190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfiXTmby83qzhCrR8j7My9UqA4D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u9tMsNjPdjCQHKAvCROM1wCHQL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.728,"height":169,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tHVmvydZpmhMl1AGf6FaSr8Tmv1.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":968}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hZNvAd5ccDprQD2Sv3j65C2cajQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2025-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PBS","release_date":"2025-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
