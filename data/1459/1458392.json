Annalisa Quagliata has taken up the lessons of Price’s handmade film course at MassArt, maintaining their queer resonances while reshaping them with the perhaps unanticipated application to the unmaking and remaking of myths of the Mexican body politic. This 2016 tribute to Luther Price, made in that same MassArt course before Quagliata’s return to Mexico, reminds us of the facilitating possibilities of the body in disintegration. A 16mm optical sound bar is the skeleton on which it all hangs.” – Byron Davies","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rdgoNNWafAgkLP4DAJtWwrptzQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outcry (for Luther)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annalisa D.
