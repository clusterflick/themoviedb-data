She's an immediate hit but rebels against being exploited, and throws Leaud out of their apartment.  Complications occur when she meets a nerd (Rufus) claiming to be the book's author, leading to discovery of the real author (Thierry Fortineau), a bookseller who\"s so happy to be in print at last that he's not to miffed at the deception.
