Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ogawa has been working entirely remotely, rarely leaving his home or meeting other people. At first glance, his life might seem the epitome of solitude. Yet, his days are fulfilling, occupied by hobbies like playing the digital piano, online mahjong, and tinkering with keyboard switches. Despite his contentment with this solitary lifestyle, Ogawa has been a member of a marriage agency for the past three years. One day, through the agency's app, he receives a message from a woman named Maeda. Little by little, change begins to ripple through Ogawa's quiet life.","popularity":0.1455,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Widmung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kotaro Ogawa","original_name":"Kotaro Ogawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67edb0f84909e25b07a78a36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meimei Kikuchi","original_name":"Meimei Kikuchi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67edb1004680f26bf3a78a5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyouko Sisikura","original_name":"Kyouko Sisikura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67edb10e9c68504cf2628788","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukinori Futamura","original_name":"Yukinori Futamura","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bOFq1uVgYgz29RmPKvvGii8LYKs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67edb1159c68504cf262878c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345301,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kei Miyaji","original_name":"Kei Miyaji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67edb12bcf06190cbae173ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345301,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kei Miyaji","original_name":"Kei Miyaji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67edb12f9c68504cf2628799","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345301,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kei Miyaji","original_name":"Kei Miyaji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67edb137cf06190cbae173b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345301,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kei Miyaji","original_name":"Kei Miyaji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67edb13fcf06190cbae173b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
