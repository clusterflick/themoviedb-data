These green oases make cities worth living in and provide a surprising wealth of species. Parks are often our quickest contact with nature and a great opportunity to get to know wild animals. This film shows typical and well-known park inhabitants from a new perspective. In interviews, experts introduce us to the unknown sides of crows, squirrels and the like and report on their research. This much in advance: just as city dwellers and country dwellers differ, city animals also have their very own way of life. The next time you go for a walk, you will see the animals in the park with completely new eyes!","popularity":0.4081,"poster_path":"/klpGxw63E6SRRvlvEDDRf9QKje2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":258325,"logo_path":"/kKDLBHCMKqbwPlPHRCRwXKiYOsZ.png","name":"PKM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geheimnisvolle Parktiere -
