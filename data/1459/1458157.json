After having a strange out-of-body experience, her anxiety around being predisposed to schizophrenia spirals out of control. Visions of an ancestor, who she believes to have had schizophrenia, haunt her dreams and soon begin to bleed into her everyday life. The stigma surrounding mental health disorders hangs over her head, forcing her to self-isolate despite Moss's attempts to help her. With an important gig coming up that could jumpstart her music career and get her out of employment limbo, Elena must confront her debilitating fears to find comfort - but not a cure - in music.","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Predisposition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5344673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Macken","original_name":"Sarah Macken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Relative","credit_id":"67ed5794b9424cd895ab05d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5344676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madelin Madamba","original_name":"Madelin Madamba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Elena","credit_id":"67ed57afb9424cd895ab0625","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4961210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lainey Macken","original_name":"Lainey Macken","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ed57c9b9424cd895ab0633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4961210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lainey Macken","original_name":"Lainey Macken","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ed57d56cdbeea7b9ce5e58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29795738","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
