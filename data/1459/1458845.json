Meanwhile, his ex-love, Julia, has started a new life on the other side of the country. Life for her is going great, and it seems like the best decision she's ever madeâ€”at least, that's what she tells herself. When fate unexpectedly throws them back into each other's lives,  they stand face-to-face, no longer as lovers, but as strangers. Both are changed by time and distance, and they must confront each other in a new light, unsure of what to expect from this sudden reconnection.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/caOpsKg11vS1dtUUOCtUffMZolx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stuck in limbo
