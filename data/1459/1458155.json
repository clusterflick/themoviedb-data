Around thirty families settled in a camp below Rosans. Nearly half a century after their arrival, first- and second-generation Harkis and native Rosanais recount their experiences of this culture clash, often painful, sometimes happy. Language barriers, religious differences, living in barracks for 14 years, and unemployment were all obstacles to overcome in order to be accepted and then achieve mutual enrichment. Enriched with archive footage to explain the historical context of the time, the film seeks above all to express feelings and unspoken words.","popularity":0.109,"poster_path":"/daiDnSXxzWclIcPtNYtXWNJESWG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258284,"logo_path":"/fhKjRA8dxVBRw7XmQgd04rr6Mol.png","name":"La Forge aux Utopies","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosans, Bitter Honey","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"روزانز، العسل المر","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5344661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémi Nelson Borel","original_name":"Rémi Nelson Borel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6UHVjstPXUXE7blOGOsujvQsgFd.jpg","credit_id":"67ed5654836c8eda7caaf9fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5344661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémi Nelson Borel","original_name":"Rémi Nelson Borel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6UHVjstPXUXE7blOGOsujvQsgFd.jpg","credit_id":"67ed5671836c8eda7caafa09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeremie Van-Quynh","original_name":"Jeremie Van-Quynh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ed56b1836c8eda7caafa43","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5344661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémi Nelson Borel","original_name":"Rémi Nelson Borel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6UHVjstPXUXE7blOGOsujvQsgFd.jpg","credit_id":"67ed56bc836c8eda7caafa5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5344715,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Delphine Bole","original_name":"Delphine Bole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ed5c410e262c9a5f0150cd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2369261","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yH0FiHIxorG8BC2R0eb1U5IpSHT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiJUZsws94Zk0nAXgTQDtg10HQm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daiDnSXxzWclIcPtNYtXWNJESWG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":289049,"name":"refugees"},{"id":298300,"name":"harkis"},{"id":298954,"name":"france algérie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
