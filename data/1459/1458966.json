Formed at the initiative of a Grade 8 teacher eager to pass along his love of cinema, the club attracted a klatch of immigrant kids eager to embrace their new country. Stimulating and creative, the club was a complete departure from anything they had known and provided a safe haven from the harsh world around them. Together, they made a tiny 8mm award-winner called Ohh Canada.  Twenty-five years later, the group looks back to marvel at their childhood dreams and the bond they share with the teacher who brought them together.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you dare to go back twenty five years to find your long lost classmates?
