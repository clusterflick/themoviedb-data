Jesus Christ lands in Madrid, and the chosen ones prepare for the great ascent. But not everyone celebrates: the indifference of a group of teenagers turns into drama when one of them announces she wants to ascend. And like her, Susana's grandmother leaves everything ready beforehand, including the Tupperware croquettes. A hieratic and playful comedy that looks at miracles out of the corner of its eye, like a climate crisis denier.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/fM8qTTf4OJ6AIoi3nHV1CDlagWI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Madrid al cielo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5345393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Pérez","original_name":"Pablo Pérez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67edbea39c68504cf2628b55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fM8qTTf4OJ6AIoi3nHV1CDlagWI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
