He constantly seeks medical treatments despite being in good health. To save on medical expenses, he plans to marry his daughter Angélique to a doctor. However, Angélique loves Cléante and opposes the arranged marriage.  Argan’s clever servant, Toinette, devises a plan to expose the truth. Meanwhile, Argan’s wife, Béline, is only interested in his wealth. Through Toinette’s tricks, Argan realizes his errors and changes his ways. In the end, Angélique is allowed to marry Cléante, and Argan learns to live without his excessive fear of illness.  This play humorously criticizes the medical profession and human obsession with health through satire and wit.","popularity":0.0607,"poster_path":"/nlHVAgTYIUZOhRVGWD6NxxZf9AA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258404,"logo_path":null,"name":"SAAL Tiyatro
