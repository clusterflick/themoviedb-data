When a lone wolf finds a balloon with a note attached, he seizes the opportunity to pass on his hard-learned life lessons to the unknown infant that sent it. Lessons that do not necessarily line up with a pre-schoolerâ€™s experiences, but which may be valuable to him or her at a later age. In the process, unconnected generations find each other in this moving short film, based on a story by Tommy Wieringa.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/lJ3PUZgcVVrmsqR7t0ZzYI74LJa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39609,"logo_path":"/oht1Q1ZiJN9y0g1Bubxo8vTtpNn.png","name":"BIND","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ga niet naar zee","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1730754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Akkermans","original_name":"Julia Akkermans","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":"/9qBVdLakMZFKE4V3vzftsGI110I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c10015e0e0a2638bc0e6a53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Leysen","original_name":"Johan Leysen","popularity":0.3145,"profile_path":"/pCBvrMKTNo6cqC63qDSipbtt2Rs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c10016792514147b00dc66b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":210269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sander Burger","original_name":"Sander Burger","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1001350e0a2638c70daf77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8801530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lJ3PUZgcVVrmsqR7t0ZzYI74LJa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
