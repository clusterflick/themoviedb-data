Druze policeman Salim Barakat quickly arrived on the scene and bravely eliminated him. However, he was killed by the terrorist. For ten years, Jamal, Salim's brother, has been attending annual police ceremonies in commemoration of his brother. Suspecting they may be withholding information, he decides to go on an investigative journey to find out who killed his brother. This is the story of a bereaved brother facing the Israeli security establishment, of a Druze facing the State of Israel, and more than anything, of a man facing himself.","popularity":0.0699,"poster_path":"/ce0HZB0lrkBfTKBpSSNNseilRL3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katz Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cause of Death","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Barakat","original_name":"Salim Barakat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5c10401d0e0a2638af0f5191","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramy A.
