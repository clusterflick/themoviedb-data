John Brown, his wife, two sons, Harold and Billy, and a young sister named Helen, has settled on an isolated plantation in the Jungles. Jack Arden, son of another English planter, who comes over frequently to hunt with the boys has fallen in love with Helen. But Papa Brown discourages the lovers, saying that Helen is too young to be married. Jack agrees to wait. Some time afterward the Browns receive a letter from Jack stating that he is coming for another week-end of shooting- with the Brown boys. On his way to the Brown's home, Jack knocks down Concho, an overseer, for being cruel to one of the slaves. His action is approved of by the Browns. In honor of Jack the family starts on a lion hunt, and, after a long trip, they return by the river route. They espy a lioness drinking at the river's edge. She is killed by Jack and taken aboard. That night Jack again asks Mr. Brown for Helen's hand and is again told to wait.","popularity":0.3408,"poster_path":"/7dv0R5JS50l3UVZ8Q4CQZ3bF8ps.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone in the Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bob Arden","credit_id":"5c0d083292514147b009bbf3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1690990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Eyton","original_name":"Bessie Eyton","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/sWsS8cXywwkbyEpZacZoHQx9oT8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helen Brown","credit_id":"5c0d0840925141479209b257","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Clark","original_name":"Frank Clark","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"John S.
