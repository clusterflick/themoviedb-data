Seventeen-year-old Ursula wants it all and is thus too much, although all she's looking for is love. Enter Siegfried Grimm, the charismatic new teacher who finally recognizes Ursula's true potential. She falls for him, head over heels. A pity that Grimm sexually liberates the entire village - except Ursula. While the Grimm acolytes fight for the favor of their idol, Ursula resorts to more radical measures. Whatever it takes, she'll get back at Grimm.","popularity":0.4303,"poster_path":"/7s0g4HaUz1rC3W8ZoB9vZ3vftT0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kordes & Kordes
