The strange positions of the slaughtered bodies give a critical meaning to two traditional religious hymns that sing praise to the glory of God and the Virgin Mary. The strange postures of the mutilated bodies establish an ironical meaning to the traditional verses, while the voices of singers Agnaldo Timóteo and Ângela Maria add a pathos of deliriously popular, in an atmosphere of joy and triumph of the Virgin Mary. Film-shock. Basically an investigation about the force of gravity upon dead bodies. A small hymn of love to the mannerist art of sixteenth century.","popularity":0.1736,"poster_path":"/dmjxEJlaeei6BBnB1oUVzXIp7Jy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resurrection","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Omar","original_name":"Arthur Omar","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0b4be2c3a368252a069b08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1014082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.732,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dmjxEJlaeei6BBnB1oUVzXIp7Jy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":549}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
