When she thinks she has punished Billy enough, she decides to break her engagement with Billy's rival, and to again accept Billy's attentions. But before doing so she requests Billy's rival to return to her the letters that she had written to him during their short courtship, which he absolutely refuses to do. He informs her that he is going to Europe, and that when he returns he will amuse the boys at the club with the letters. In desperation she informs Billy of his rival's intention, and informs him that she cannot accept his offer of marriage while his rival retains those letters. On Billy learning that his rival, whom he has never met, is about to sail for Europe, he decides to burglarize the house and get his sweetheart's letters. But, unfortunately for Billy, his rival misses the boat and returns in time to catch Billy robbing the house.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/cvbEY6xSE2VC0yHBL3pkwntXh8p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gem Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy's Strategy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Quirk","original_name":"Billy Quirk","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/mVRHKE8gPNB3b3BEKIZ1rAj0W4f.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"5c0d09670e0a2638c50a98c9","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0340581","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cvbEY6xSE2VC0yHBL3pkwntXh8p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
