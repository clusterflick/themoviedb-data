Later he does just that when he finds the girl in the library, taking her to his own house. There she reveals herself to be socialite Helen Rogers, playing a game with him on the advice of her guests. He then declares himself a crook, holding the real Carroll prisoner, with the intention of robbing the Rogers mansion. She follows and shields \"The Magnet\" from the police, the real Carroll having escaped and notified them, and through her interference he eludes his would-be captors.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":"/lu0HZRTnTWq5HONq2smWh7q3sgW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selznick Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene O'Brien","original_name":"Eugene O'Brien","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/xgK8VBc7jLcbfpY1PPpRPRqkt1J.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Magnet","credit_id":"5c0a9d1e0e0a2638b6047ef5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nita Naldi","original_name":"Nita Naldi","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/nwcwYPv1W3J1zyIpXvtEAOyNm4g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Widow","credit_id":"5c0a9dd7c3a368252004a6d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Mansfield","original_name":"Martha Mansfield","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/o64uUPmoUqSFkuCTRPxH1XaMNwy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Helen Rogers","credit_id":"5c0a9df1c3a368252a04aca5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1374228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Perry","original_name":"Katherine Perry","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/62D7gyckQ6HXvdckQ3OdqGqB6oi.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Guest","credit_id":"5c0a9dfc0e0a2638b80492b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Cook","original_name":"Warren Cook","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":"/dSIjJucRiF4ZZ630CW3EARbRK4H.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Colonel","credit_id":"5c0a9e09925141479a046200","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c0a9d14925141479a045f85","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Craig","original_name":"Charles Craig","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Freddie Tripp","credit_id":"5c0a9dcb0e0a2638af04c0e1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2190606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Pillsbury","original_name":"Helen Pillsbury","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Rogers","credit_id":"5c0a9de5c3a3682518049fa3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William P.S.
