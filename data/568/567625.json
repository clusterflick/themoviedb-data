During this time, the representatives of the previous administration confessed all their sins, repented and genuinely swore allegiance to the new administration. The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia has made a decision to open the KGB archives in May 2018. The film is an endeavour to answer the question of whether the lustration that never took place in the 1990s may turn out to be dangerous for the future existence of statehood.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":"/xTDjPNqThjzzFBM59AsKnziNjgD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2018-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lustrum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Armands Začs","original_name":"Armands Začs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6xvyKUtUt7y9SGofrTxkvE3CnVH.jpg","credit_id":"5c0e3a0392514147aa0ade64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","original_name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0e3a1892514147aa0ade75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gints Grūbe","original_name":"Gints Grūbe","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/6GGLvVF0lsMjs8RsW6PR9S16eaR.jpg","credit_id":"5c0e39d6925141479e0ac4f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"5fcc037041aac400417497bb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sanita Jemberga","original_name":"Sanita Jemberga","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3227ef48e0d0040c12151","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604659,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kārlis Auzāns","original_name":"Kārlis Auzāns","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/fMlOa8ag3OTan5azmwxrHXhBQqT.jpg","credit_id":"5fd322ce55c1f40040a916e7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10062286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1541,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xTDjPNqThjzzFBM59AsKnziNjgD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1040}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Filmas Lustrum treileris","key":"293550839","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-05T12:54:37.000Z","id":"6010aba722e4800040074c6d"}]}}}
