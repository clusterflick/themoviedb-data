It is a sprawling triptych without a beginning or end and with no specific subject or topic. The camera is positioned in front of a window and left running. It observes movements, registers noises coming from the street or nearby park, captures Chantal Akerman going about her business in her apartment: smoking, working, talking on the telephone. Fragments from the artist’s everyday life are featured in the installation’s central video, while the adjoining panels are more symbolically charged; in them, various images from the former have been isolated, modified and repeated. These abstract afterimages act as a kind of memory, looking back to the images in the installation’s centrepiece as so many shadows of its reality.","popularity":0.3241,"poster_path":"/eLQSLAyZpKRWKFcN7UGBtlFIyZR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maniac Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c0f0b9a0e0a2638c70c6ae6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","credit_id":"5c0f0bad92514147920c5d35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","credit_id":"5c0f0bcc0e0a2638d30d6761","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","credit_id":"5c0f0c15c3a368252a0d6208","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1270678,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claire Atherton","original_name":"Claire Atherton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0f0befc3a36825180d2659","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1270678,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claire Atherton","original_name":"Claire Atherton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0f0bfa925141479a0c9234","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLQSLAyZpKRWKFcN7UGBtlFIyZR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7307,"name":"routine"},{"id":198343,"name":"observation"},{"id":224310,"name":"triptych"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
