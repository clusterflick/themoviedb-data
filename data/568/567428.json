The protagonist works at a production line where automated processes have made her approach her job and its effects in a cool-headed emotionless way. Each day, she makes chicken for dinner, but one day, a piece of meat starts staring at her in a strange way. A grotesque animation about what ends up on our plates.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oRSfi33CqZ0vqoDBRz0T9WVYGew.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eatself","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642469,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Piotr Morawski","original_name":"Piotr Morawski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ceb78713ea60128682e5e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edyta Adamczak","original_name":"Edyta Adamczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c67080e0a2638b8091124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michał Mądracki","original_name":"Michał Mądracki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6b87c3a368252308e92c","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edyta Adamczak","original_name":"Edyta Adamczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6b9f0e0a2638cc09450f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edyta Adamczak","original_name":"Edyta Adamczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6bb5925141479e085d08","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edyta Adamczak","original_name":"Edyta Adamczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6bc292514147aa086704","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2191505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hubert Wińczyk","original_name":"Hubert Wińczyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6bdfc3a3682515097bc9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2191505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hubert Wińczyk","original_name":"Hubert Wińczyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6befc3a3682518095c6e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michał Jankowski","original_name":"Michał Jankowski","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6c0c92514147b008b9b0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edyta Adamczak","original_name":"Edyta Adamczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c6c350e0a2638d3096e7f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oRSfi33CqZ0vqoDBRz0T9WVYGew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
