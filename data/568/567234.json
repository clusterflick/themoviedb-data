The title was a take-off of The Winds of War, which premiered as a TV miniseries on the same night on ABC. In a 30-second spot, Orson Welles says: \"Why spend 18 hours watching someone else's war, when you know how it comes out? We win, and then have to buy all their cars. Watch Steve Martin's The Winds of Whoopie. See it all in one hour on Sunday.\"  The show is a combination of old and new material compiled from past Martin specials and his appearances on Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Martin's The Winds of Whoopie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1075089","wikidata_id":"Q7775110","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
