To say that it is beautiful would be a great understatement. It is a microcosm of the history of this great island and has for centuries been the main western route between England and Scotland. Iron Age men roamed, Vikings plundered, Romans marched, the Scots raided and Kings sent their armies. Even now within the space of a few hundred yards of the river Lune in The Lune Gap you find the M6 motorway, the main West Coast railway and the ancient roman marching road to Hadrianâ€™s Wall.  Historic towns, industrial heritage, ancient customs and much more all combine to make the Lune Valley a wonderful place to explore.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Lune Valley Our Heritage","title":"The Lune Valley Our Heritage","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
