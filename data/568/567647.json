Of course, he doesn't have a normal family with a name like that: Papa's an idiot who takes matters into his own hands, no matter the circumstances, Hajime's just a baby and is renowned for his genius, and Mama is the extra-resilient voice of reason. Life certainly isn't boring either, with Papa stopping a fraudster, the parents celebrating their anniversary and sharing how they met, and the foolish patriarch himself deciding to run away and solve a marriage crisis on live television. It's a big dumb world out there, but that's how it should be!","popularity":0.7638,"poster_path":"/gvrGOt6jpTjiMrqa5VqrqQzmCEf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6755,"logo_path":"/c0ENH8QeZLvCACpzCpwvYMy2SDr.png","name":"Nippon Television Network
