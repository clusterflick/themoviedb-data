The M-Decree obliges schools to adapt to the needs of children. This documentary observes in beautiful black and white how four children with different special needs experience going to a normal school. Inclusief is not a rushed TV report or reality series that panders to your emotions, but a carefully made, cinematic film that offers an intimate insight into the lives of four children, Rosie, Sami, Irakli and Nathan.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6Exa1DQ5pupfVFfbIYicnxnD6Xq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inclusive","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Krüger","original_name":"Peter Krüger","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d6f3cf14dad00f273fd56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Vermeulen","original_name":"Ellen Vermeulen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d6f1b1684f700c4ea1070","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2086183,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonathan Wannyn","original_name":"Jonathan Wannyn","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d6f2b1b729400cd03f635","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Vermeulen","original_name":"Ellen Vermeulen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0c62969251414792089951","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10936930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Exa1DQ5pupfVFfbIYicnxnD6Xq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
