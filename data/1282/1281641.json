Her work explores the representation of Black and mixed-race cultures drawing on her rural upbringing and British Bahamian heritage.  Set in Norfolk’s coastal village of Happisburgh the film navigates how a body, both two and three dimensional, acquires language. The human and photographic bodies must negotiate Norfolk’s eroding landscape. As notions of ‘I’ and ‘other’ disintegrate the images become unstable and unreliable alluding to the effects of coastal erosion on Happisburgh’s coastline and questioning ‘what place does a mixed-race body have in this landscape’.  The Kodachrome film – overlaid with grainy family holiday photos and mobile phone footage – was once hailed for its vibrant colours and archival properties however it is now unable to be commercially produced.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/qoO604pMfW2PTbDcH4I8yAyPUn6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Image that Spits, the Eye that Accumulates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhea Storr","original_name":"Rhea Storr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z2S1J5LZHRl5JgQQ7gJeA0vFkTy.jpg","credit_id":"662e9817f6fd18012b22e328","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qoO604pMfW2PTbDcH4I8yAyPUn6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
