It is run in a high, wide, and handsome manner by the owner of Riley's Saloon. There is a little church in the town built in haste many years ago but it has been securely boarded up for years. Mr. Riley intended it to remain so for his Sunday business was booming. A traveling evangelist who learned his profession as a circus performer arrives in the town with Charles Bullephant, a peevish elephant; Joe Martin, a highly-cultured orang-outang; and Buster, a famous trained horse. With help from his friends, he sets out to make Beer Bottle Bend a church-going community.","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/hGAffdbLXKAyESKyL9jhllhVoGx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Prohibition Monkey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Martin","original_name":"Joe Martin","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/chphypqMbD6OkmMSQZAzynRseaB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joe Martin - An Orang-outang","credit_id":"662daa13f6fd1801282292d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4679623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrs. Joe Martin","original_name":"Mrs. Joe Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5ulcTFj2HpSrdia8qabAaATykRC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"A Chimp","credit_id":"662daa285a7884012ac199b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fontaine La Rue","original_name":"Fontaine La Rue","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/gUlDAnnczXncfSFtOTHGu9wLtBO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"662daa3803bf840125ea9280","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Hayes","original_name":"Frank Hayes","popularity":0.0567,"profile_path":"/uNwFqMvzSRS7peGdVP8XoWV62iD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"662daa5ca199a601227258fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert McKenzie","original_name":"Robert McKenzie","popularity":0.3475,"profile_path":"/tOtQxK0ksf8TH1sZA6s4XqS7vuv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"662daa62e33f83012b215ccf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry McGrath","original_name":"Larry McGrath","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"662daa6f5b9508012a559b79","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al McKinnon","original_name":"Al McKinnon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"662daa7d07216601216958ff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4679624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Nowell","original_name":"Arthur Nowell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"662daa87028f14012b68b235","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":153356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Mae McKenzie","original_name":"Ida Mae McKenzie","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"662daaa9e33f83012b215d36","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3335927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie the Elephant","original_name":"Charlie the Elephant","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/fKb0qwWJNUUET7UIoBqyVT7ye1A.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Charles Bullephant","credit_id":"662dab987d5db501233dd40d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Campbell","original_name":"William Campbell","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662daaff69d280012642d5fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0376092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1095,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGAffdbLXKAyESKyL9jhllhVoGx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2857,"name":"elephant"},{"id":2673,"name":"horse"},{"id":14762,"name":"orangutan"},{"id":41585,"name":"traveling circus"},{"id":157972,"name":"chimpanzee"},{"id":172143,"name":"evangelism"},{"id":211044,"name":"alcohol problems"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1920-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
