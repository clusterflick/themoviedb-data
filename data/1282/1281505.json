A recurring interstitial black screen with the words “ten minutes” becomes a constant reinforcement of transience, a career and life distilled to the precious few minutes of the film, a reflection of its brevity.","popularity":0.1184,"poster_path":"/oUrRpbd5Pw0F7K2nCkhVTrIBaVa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Moment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Hrušínský","original_name":"Rudolf Hrušínský","popularity":0.4421,"profile_path":"/xbOll9C0VYLTRmQz7jqdkRFEDyU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"662e5eab8a88b20127ce60ab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiří Menzel","original_name":"Jiří Menzel","popularity":0.3247,"profile_path":"/nsYGLTdi2F3voF0WlLiysaR3X5a.jpg","credit_id":"662e5e8c7d5db501233e2712","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oUrRpbd5Pw0F7K2nCkhVTrIBaVa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
