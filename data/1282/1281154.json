It reuses the format of a 1976 film in which the artist recorded herself reciting \"good night\" to the camera before retiring for bed.  For Jonas, the repurposing of elements from past films is a strategy that creates a dialogue across time.  \"The style of performance is straightforward,\" she observes of this 2006 work, \"but more playful or contrived, perhaps affected by the experience of years of performing.\"  Here, Jonas addresses the camera through a convex mirror that distorts her home, a testament to her longstanding interest in manipulating space.
