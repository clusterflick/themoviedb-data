Who clears away the remains? Deer, wild boar, mice, beetles, flies, wasps and many others - how are they all connected? A team of researchers in the Bavarian Forest National Park on Germany's border with the Czech Republic is on the trail of these exciting questions.

A film about life after death.","popularity":0.1402,"poster_path":"/zeUwRnWRVKqeji5kDAh4EXmkzXI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feast
