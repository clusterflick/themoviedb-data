Poppaea, a courtesan and mistress of Emperor Nero, removes every obstacle that stands between her and the throne: she leaves her lover, Otho, the philosopher Seneca commits suicide, Empress Octavia is banished, and finally she achieves her goal, marrying Nero.

Monteverdi's last opera is also the first masterpiece of the genre, extraordinarily and enduringly modern. Here, it is filmed at the Opera Royal de Versailles, with a young and committed cast, guided through a mafia-baroque world by director Ted Huffman and the sensational Leonardo Garcia Alarcon!","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/daNV5OCXqIHesNzYR9klVSiK16D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Incoronazione di Poppea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Monteverdi: L'Incoronazione di Poppea","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Benoit","original_name":"Elsa Benoit","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Poppée","credit_id":"662ec79a69d2800123432952","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Arditti","original_name":"Jake Arditti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Néron","credit_id":"662ec7b6e33f83012821b3f4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Huffman","original_name":"Ted Huffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ec7d0511d090121c55212","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claudio Monteverdi","original_name":"Claudio Monteverdi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/jOCDfg8XQABcdgQUXe62yrnKT2y.jpg","credit_id":"662ec7dc35811d012be8695d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daNV5OCXqIHesNzYR9klVSiK16D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
