In the spring of 2004, three young men, Xin'er, Xiu'er and Shasha, have to undergo a sex change operation in Changchun to transform themselves into the women they have longed for. Another clue is that in the process of Xinyi's and Xiu'er's \"butterfly transformation\", a bridge in Changchun, built during the period of the Manchus, is also blown to pieces by a violent means - demolition. It was blown to smithereens. A new bridge was quickly built on the same site. In today's world, both individual people and society as a whole sometimes use the most violent and bloody means to transform themselves, perhaps for the sole purpose of looking good.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Chrysalis to Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4081552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Yiren","original_name":"Wang Yiren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662d3bec8a88b20121cddf78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"YunFest","release_date":"2007-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beijing Queer Film Forum","release_date":"2007-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"China Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2007-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
