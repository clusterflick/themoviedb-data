His transformation is so complete that he is able to perform on stage and make a living in bars all over Beijing. Though his lifestyle is far from the norms of Chinese society, he feels no disgrace or dishonor. Tang Tang is is not just about gay and lesbian relationship but, more importantly, about the constant reversals in life: to live or to die, to be male or female and, to love or to hate. We often think that reality is fixed, but tomorrow brings reversal. What you consider as reality is just the outer appearance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tangtang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4678839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Hanzi","original_name":"Zhang Hanzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662d3625511d090127c4d4ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Beijing Queer Film Forum","release_date":"2007-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
