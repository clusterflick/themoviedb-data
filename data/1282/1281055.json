Farmers Kak Mohammad and Mashhadi Askar, who come from different backgrounds, are facing the environmental challenges in their own way. Kak Mohammad's well still has some water, but as the sea dries up, he can no longer feed his garden. Drought and salt storms bring disasters that lead to recession, unemployment and disease in the region. Villagers turn to prayer, each following his faith: Mashhadi Asgar and the Azaris hold a ceremony near the dried lake, while Kak Mohammad and the Kurds gather in mosques. Despite setbacks, Kak Mohammad persists with wedding plans for his son, but concerns about the future and the state of the lake persist.","popularity":0.044,"poster_path":"/b00jdlDWdaJ8VEpn6BhstYDz30w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lavan Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2023-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taste of Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119423,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ebrahim Saeedi","original_name":"Ebrahim Saeedi","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/bKkYW39SEVA2rZEW7pmi3OsmJAr.jpg","credit_id":"662d0fa7713ea601286836f3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705896,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ali Samadpour","original_name":"Ali Samadpour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662d0fc7e33f83012821113f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119423,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ebrahim Saeedi","original_name":"Ebrahim Saeedi","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/bKkYW39SEVA2rZEW7pmi3OsmJAr.jpg","credit_id":"662d0f23e33f830122210e58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mnsqMnFVcQAolcfZEs0AgRP6FHJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1468,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b00jdlDWdaJ8VEpn6BhstYDz30w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":979}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ku","note":"13.
