From 1942 to 1946 Giuseppe was a prisoner in several different camps: Tambow, Oranki and Suzdal. He got to know many people, heard lot of stories and came across a truly unique piece of reportage. The narrator and second character of the story is the actress Karina Arutyunyan who acts the part of a Russian woman that lives in Italy for years, whose grandfather fought on the Russian side during Second World War. The two characters in this story are emotionally very close; however, they are diametrically opposed. While Giuseppe and his story are both real, Katerina is a fictional character; that is how fiction and reality are closely intertwined along the story.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":"/dvrn1OYbCLME4dJFHAodm62k9f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emera Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bassil'ora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Bassi","original_name":"Giuseppe Bassi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"600dea97e8d0b40040fc55e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karina Arutyunyan","original_name":"Karina Arutyunyan","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/257tL1cw1UXCeZDGFpiTGnOVOKc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"600dea9db5bc21003c90e37f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Basso","original_name":"Rebecca Basso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deaab4d0e8d003f77dbdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Basso","original_name":"Rebecca Basso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deab0ddd52d0040909948","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Basso","original_name":"Rebecca Basso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deab7b2e074003e081fb0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950715,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luca Bozzato","original_name":"Luca Bozzato","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deac1ddd52d0041908b62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950715,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luca Bozzato","original_name":"Luca Bozzato","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deaec92e55b003d65e908","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385122,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lorenzo Pezzano","original_name":"Lorenzo Pezzano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deaf7c433ea0041439314","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915895,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Zambrano","original_name":"Marco Zambrano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600deb05cb8028003e01ef3f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9856554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1142,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dvrn1OYbCLME4dJFHAodm62k9f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":761}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
