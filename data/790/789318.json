Conflict ignites as 22-year-old George Washington steps onto the world stage as the murderer of a French emissary. In the subsequent battle of Fort Necessity, the emissary's brother leads a French army that defeats Washington. These events lead to the 1755 campaign of British General Edward Braddock and George Washington against the French in the wilderness. With the British a day away, a charismatic French officer leads his French/Indian force in an improbable attack on Braddock's column. The resulting battle will change American history.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Washington, Braddock & a Doomed Army","title":"When the Forest Ran Red","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0376983","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
