He used his accumulated wealth to improve the life of the orang tekil (the common man) in Indonesia. For example, he published his own book about the lack of a sewer system and he saw to it that the local population was vaccinated ('one vaccinator does more for the pacification of Indonesia than an army of soldiers'). By means of a staggering amount of self-shot and collected material, this `one-man Third World movement' qualified the limited, positive image of our former colony that persisted until the forties.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95556,"logo_path":"/gMsu30npr1bSVn7jAjJ2A2jO6S8.png","name":"EYE Film Institute Netherlands","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tillema, de Multatuli van de fotografie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2949299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herman de Boer","original_name":"Herman de Boer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600cacffe8d0b40041fadcd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398928,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Roumen","original_name":"Frank Roumen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600cad0eed28b9003ef7b022","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
