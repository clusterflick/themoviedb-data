It centres the implications of identity, place and conflict for black folks living in Essex. Specifically, it disrupts the existing narratives. By giving a platform to these black voices, the work attempts to form new understandings of blackness viewed through a contemporary Essex lens.  â€‹","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/dmCS5cn0KVlfbArGUKnMRS9Kwg6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Girl Essex: Here We Come, Look We Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2949371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elsa James","original_name":"Elsa James","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600cba3322e480003e02a085","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dmCS5cn0KVlfbArGUKnMRS9Kwg6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
