Some of the locals used to know Stalin personally because he visited the village several times when he was young, and they continue to see him as a benign ruler from the good old days rather than the brutal dictator he was. Whenever an episode of purge shook the Soviet Union’s republics, they hid the statue in the woods. The church also plays an important role in people’s lives. All in all, the film reveals a fundamental conflict in Georgian society.","popularity":0.2863,"poster_path":"/hsudZTiJq8ueeA0n0AGuzeShMK7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ruler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951285,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beka Gersamia","original_name":"Beka Gersamia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e7742006eee003b83aa66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1631890,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paata Godziashvili","original_name":"Paata Godziashvili","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e775c0cd446003fe1ed69","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951287,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zurab Javakhia","original_name":"Zurab Javakhia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e776b0e597b0040325c1f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951283,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nino Chutkerashvili","original_name":"Nino Chutkerashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e771a7776f0004112436a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951284,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Giorgi Sigua","original_name":"Giorgi Sigua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e7729391b9c0042d9acbf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shalva Shengeli","original_name":"Shalva Shengeli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e77049a6435003f91eaf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"ka","file_path":"/hsudZTiJq8ueeA0n0AGuzeShMK7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6539,"name":"joseph stalin"},{"id":12626,"name":"georgia europe"},{"id":156498,"name":"georgian"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
