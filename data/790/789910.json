An asocial, weird woman Pina hates rubbish and loves nature. One day she bumps into a blind man and feels some connection with him. Pina invites him for a walk to The Magic Forest, which really exist only in her imagination. They become closer as they they walk and she describes fantastic creatures that live in the Forest around them. Can they get over the distance and fear that separates each of them from each other and the rest of the world? And in the end, did she really exist? Or was it all in his imagination?","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/lAnjPCNAKJkk76JbKl2FuXGC7nz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2094251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Di Chiara","original_name":"Bruno Di Chiara","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/2QXyG0pD36g85iJ1GxDzqlP9erA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"600df1a722e480003e04d069","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marzia Pellegrino","original_name":"Marzia Pellegrino","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"600df1af0b5fd6003f5cc63b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaia Lo Vecchio","original_name":"Gaia Lo Vecchio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"600df1b5b2e074003f0797b4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Foscari","original_name":"Marco Foscari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600df200813cb6003f7e251b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2446058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yulia Shuvchinskaya","original_name":"Julia Shuvchinskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600df1c0c8113d003d914adf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2446058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yulia Shuvchinskaya","original_name":"Julia Shuvchinskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600df1c4c8113d003e913ddc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2446058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yulia Shuvchinskaya","original_name":"Julia Shuvchinskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600df1ccd55c3d003e737d77","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2446058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yulia Shuvchinskaya","original_name":"Julia Shuvchinskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600df1d1b5bc21003c90ebf9","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2446058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yulia Shuvchinskaya","original_name":"Julia Shuvchinskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600df212c433ea003e42f1ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10712178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"pina2019","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lAnjPCNAKJkk76JbKl2FuXGC7nz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Premiere International Film Festival of the Commonwealth Countries","release_date":"2020-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
