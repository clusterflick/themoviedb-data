She chose the Creuse region, a rough and supple land, laborious yet luminous, but experiences a growing rejection of the agricultural standards that govern her production. Raising her three children, caring for her animals and plants, will always be more important to her than yield. In parallel, her children learn to make choices in the face of the standards imposed on them by the school system.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/oVjgiBnQTjsjBW6a7wtMQTL8jlT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Middle Earth","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2947646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliette Guignard","original_name":"Juliette Guignard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600b3c8cd55c3d003d6cbbfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oVjgiBnQTjsjBW6a7wtMQTL8jlT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"fran√ßais\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
