Nor has he reckoned on the mischievous spirit in which the wives will use their wits and wiles to teach him the error of his ways.  Set in the 1950s, in a town not unlike Stratford, Ontario, this production brings Shakespeare's rollicking comedy close to home - and close to our hearts.","popularity":1.5297,"poster_path":"/acCV7yc0FI78cwwsqgrSBDs0Bsn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stratford
