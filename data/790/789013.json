George Washington made himself into a man capable of founding the most powerful nation in the world. In Pursuit of Honor we explore his early military career in the French & Indian War and understand how these experiences shaped his approach to the Revolution. We see how his management of Mount Vernon prepared him to administer the Continental Army.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paladin Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rise of George Washington","title":"Pursuit of Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0854673","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
