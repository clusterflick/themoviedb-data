It was the first show that combined ballet with the video game. Ever since the ballet has been enthusiastically welcomed by not only ballet-lovers but also those who would otherwise never see a ballet, including Dragon Quest fans. It has been highly regarded as a unique and exceptional entertainment-ballet that successfully broadens the border of ballet. For the first time, this performance has been captured on video.","popularity":0.3876,"poster_path":"/y1XkyTmgTQlU9lr0zTPJ5rcIUkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music
