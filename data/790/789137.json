So Miss Prue, the good-looking stenographer to whom Mrs. Nag objects, dresses in man's attire. On her way to business one morning she sends a bouquet of flowers to Mrs. Nag, with the inscription, \"Compliments of an ardent admirer.\" Miss Prue apprises her boss of her deed, and when Mrs. Nag arrives at his office, he accuses her of having another admirer. Miss Prue is victorious and when we see her in the last scene she is her own admirable self once more, seated before the typewriter in Mr. Nag's office, with every prospect of being an uninterrupted and permanent employee. Mild and docile, Mrs. Nag modestly enters the office, but offers no objections or interruptions, submissively waiting for her husband to escort her home.","popularity":0.3536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Subduing of Mrs. Nag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bunny","original_name":"John Bunny","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/jKA4iSzu1mCzPEP5U3kKBxJRpgt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Nag","credit_id":"600b239e3f8ede0041636802","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Nag","credit_id":"600b23ab4d0e8d003f730d35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Prue, the Stenographer","credit_id":"600b23bac433ea003e3f4948","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1690933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrs. B.F.
