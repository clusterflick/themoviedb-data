An assassin's bullet set off the war, and a system of military agreements brought the main European powers into the fight.  Both sides expected a quick victory, but the war lasted four years and took the lives of almost 10 million men.  Extreme patriotism gave men a cause to die for and propaganda raised support for the war while making the enemy seem villainous.  This fascinating 2-part documentary program chronicles the major events of this devastating period in the world's history through insightful narration and compelling archival footage and photographs.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/ljDT3Vc4MynVpbhYBK3k864QRI6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dan Dalton Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World War I: A Lost Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Thomas","original_name":"Jeff Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"677bb5661a2df59ad3751e87","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Dalton","original_name":"Daniel Dalton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bb5786d7ca00e7872d52d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Hanrahan","original_name":"Jack Hanrahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bb58ba6def0111a74c549","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088185,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marlene Carabello","original_name":"Marlene Carabello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bb5a76d7ca00e7872d539","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161834,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rigo Saenz","original_name":"Rigo Saenz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bb5c21a2df59ad3751eb0","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Dalton","original_name":"Daniel Dalton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bb5d525e0e91c5775085b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Casey Dalton","original_name":"Casey Dalton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bb5e5eca85bd50872957e","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":769,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ljDT3Vc4MynVpbhYBK3k864QRI6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
