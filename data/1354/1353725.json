Near his house is a unique museum \"Memories of the Fatherland\", which has no analogues in the country. The self-taught master carves figurines from wood, decorates them with vines and straw, and arranges them into scenes from peasant life and everyday life. Specialists call this kind of activity instinctive art. That is, his creativity was formed naturally and such is free from the sphere of any professional influence. Through the personality of the hero and his wooden people, the film provides an opportunity to join the ancient way of life of Belarusians, which is gradually disappearing.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wooden People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Asliuk","original_name":"Victor Asliuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dcc4c07542731bcb342cef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volha Dashuk","original_name":"Volha Dashuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dcc4e70bcea093a7785e7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27429619","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"be","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
