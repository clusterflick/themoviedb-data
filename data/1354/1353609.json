Outnumbered, virtually encircled, Napoleon opted for a high-risk strategy of striking against Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia, before the other Coalition armies could come to his aid. The four-day Battle of Leipzig would be the largest and bloodiest battle in European history before the First World War, and one that changed the destiny of Europe.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/kcAuNfajcPiGeZvW8oWv2YaSIZ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epic History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleonic Wars: Battle of Leipzig 1813","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Nove","original_name":"Charles Nove","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66dc626327884e21da342790","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rw8sYeIPbdxaoqf15361r9IsfU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2472,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kcAuNfajcPiGeZvW8oWv2YaSIZ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
