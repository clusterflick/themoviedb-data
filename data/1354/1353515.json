But then one young Scottish biologist changed that forever. In 1965 Iain Douglas-Hamilton arrived in Tanzania to live alongside African elephants. Later joined by his wife Oria and daughters Saba and Dudu, elephants became central to their lives with matriarch Boadicea and gentle young mother Virgo cherished like human relatives. But this garden Eden was short-lived as an ivory poaching epidemic swept across Africa forcing Iain to switch from pioneering scientist to maverick conservationist. He became a lone crusader against the international Ivory trade which was finally banned in 1989. Now back in the field and revealing even more about the fascinating world of elephants, Iain’s work continues alongside a new generation of Kenyan conservationists. This inspiring documentary combines stunning wildlife imagery with the story of a remarkable life showing how sometimes you have to stand alone to protect what you love.","popularity":1.8388,"poster_path":"/lfeflYHtZ7mxBlqzUzIweGiSwwH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81712,"logo_path":"/uNAOCK8YlVxLlSrhLjTCT8C9vWc.png","name":"Maramedia","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":238438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Save the Elephants","origin_country":"KE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of legendary elephant scientist Iain Douglas-Hamilton.","title":"A Life Among Elephants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2406627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iain Douglas-Hamilton","original_name":"Iain Douglas-Hamilton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Portrait Subject & Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc99244f274b1467965d5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saba Douglas-Hamilton","original_name":"Saba Douglas-Hamilton","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/7ITJ8XtDgjyqvAxtZXg7wH2b8qX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc99392b4e038fbee4137e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1534952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dudu Douglas-Hamilton","original_name":"Dudu Douglas-Hamilton","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/7XJV2Qy2USijqxOerzILVSJDLhb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc994bc50ab6734c645d34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4929313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oria Douglas-Hamilton","original_name":"Oria Douglas-Hamilton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc99656a0241d9b938a4fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":186329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Goodall","original_name":"Jane Goodall","popularity":0.3695,"profile_path":"/iuBnQ8mXFfhsGM78l6uFkgeo7m2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc997911a81fe4ddec4ea0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4929314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Daballen","original_name":"David Daballen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc99946540893c554976c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2228985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Pope","original_name":"Frank Pope","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":30,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dd1368a556568ded3ab154","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4929318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Festus Ihwagi","original_name":"Festus Ihwagi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"66dc9a55be21f92cda9dba26","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4929326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David H.M.
