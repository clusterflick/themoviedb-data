With interviews inspired by traditional Scottish oral storytelling, young individuals recount their experiences, challenges, and hopes for the future.  Through these stories, viewers gain insight into the complexities of rural life and the aspirations of a youth who often feel disconnected from the larger societal narrative. This film isn’t just a collection of voices; it's a celebration of resilience and a commitment to forging a future that honors their roots. These are their accounts - authentic, and filled with the spirit of a generation eager to be heard.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/177YfEUW9MRwOsJ0rMmdANW9OVu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their Accounts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hannah Hunter","original_name":"Hannah Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fb49326ec7804796d62387","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231237,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eve Park","original_name":"Eve Park","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5eec50ca6bfa8042fb7e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/177YfEUW9MRwOsJ0rMmdANW9OVu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
