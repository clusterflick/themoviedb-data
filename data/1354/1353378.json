As a child, Mikah believed he could never have a successful life AND be publicly out and gay. When he moved to college and met Larry, his openly gay choir professor, a lifelong mentorship was born. Amidst conversations and joy along the river, we understand the power and importance of their friendship. As Larry enters what he calls the ‘final chapter’ of his life, he reflects on the lifelong fight for openness and vulnerability within the queer community, and through the desolation of nature, finds contentment in a job well done.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kNc2gpWOt4jE3WbRHuGm6iDQqcT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canyon Chorus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Cresci","original_name":"Chris Cresci","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db9ccf0f4bcfdf563556e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Cresci","original_name":"Chris Cresci","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db9cd91d61a544c0340a43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makenzie Wallace","original_name":"Makenzie Wallace","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db9ce6d9cf1123a9f5bf6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658175,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Kressin","original_name":"Tim Kressin","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db9cf89d95ddce18ccf0de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kNc2gpWOt4jE3WbRHuGm6iDQqcT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
