With him is his partner, filmmaker Maja Doroteja Prelog, tasked with capturing the triumphant biking tour. What was initially planned as a ride from the Dolomites to Sicily to reclaim control of one's own life and celebrate overcoming their greatest fear, soon becomes a journey of self-discovery for the couple. The focus shifted and now Maja's experience and needs hold the lens. While the lens of the camera turns inward, the relationship unravels, revealing a brave examination of self and what it truly means to be together. CENT'ANNI is an emotional rollercoaster with heart-wrenching confessions and poetic visuals in the midst of beautiful natural sceneries, an unfiltered testament to love and change.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/uLPYMAjm67ER3boP1bJJdeWa0WS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cvinger film","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":93046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zwinger Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":36299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agresywna Banda","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":104330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wake Up Films","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":158754,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zena Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cent'anni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Doroteja Prelog","original_name":"Maja Doroteja Prelog","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66dd5735736736058a9a9902","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blaž Murn","original_name":"Blaž Murn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"670f83d933e1478f766dd84d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Murn","original_name":"Jovan Jovanović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"670f83e3019f3bc5b11bdab5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Doroteja Prelog","original_name":"Maja Doroteja Prelog","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd572cc1089222ebec6eb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3044509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marija Zidar","original_name":"Marija Zidar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/anKTiPJegEnYpMJdzNQoszWmM9Z.jpg","credit_id":"670f83b4019f3bc5b11bda87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Doroteja Prelog","original_name":"Maja Doroteja Prelog","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f83c933e1478f766dd849","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30874320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uLPYMAjm67ER3boP1bJJdeWa0WS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CinEast − Central and Eastern European Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
