In Inay (Tagalog for “Mama”), director Thea Loo and cinematographer Jeremiah Reyes (a husband and wife duo) turn the camera on themselves to explore the cultural and psychological impact on the children who were abandoned by their mothers out of economic necessity. With remarkable frankness, Jeremiah and their friend Shirley testify to similar narratives of secrets, anger, a lack of belonging, and the depression that results from intergenerational trauma, revealing that childhood wounds linger even into adulthood.","popularity":0.2786,"poster_path":"/j2PPx5LbpfwaNhK1kQQNZVjnvL3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2024-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thea Loo","original_name":"Thea Loo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db393ac1089222ebec2a64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29099894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"inay.film","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2944,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j2PPx5LbpfwaNhK1kQQNZVjnvL3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1987}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
