It invites reflection on the stories and living conditions of a community on the outskirts of La Laguna, formed by the drainage of the Las Piedras stream. Through interviews with neighbors, urban adaptations to their needs and reality are explored. Using sounds, images, and poetry, the documentary makes these stories visible, strengthening identity and promoting social inclusion through the democratization of words. Despite their reality, this community promotes solidarity, community values, and keeping memory alive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lagoon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea","original_name":"Andrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66dbe9a58a4a5b8bfe389ba0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina","original_name":"Martina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66dbe9ad1adf71c2f9f5d625","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luls","original_name":"Luls","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66dbe9b811cab217566d079a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago","original_name":"Santiago","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66dbe9bf7b7dacb5c349712e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel González Velásquez","original_name":"Gabriel González Velásquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dbe9d18098633ddfee2163","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esteban Ruiz Diaz Noguera","original_name":"Esteban Ruiz Diaz Noguera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dbe9dcbb7de9f237389caf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928419,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leadro Barravino","original_name":"Leadro Barravino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dbe9e8d1b6aaf74d6d07f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
