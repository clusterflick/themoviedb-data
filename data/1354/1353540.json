The school was known for its innovative modern design that was unique to the region, reflecting the area’s cultural and historical roots. However, the school sustained significant damage during Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in 2005.  Despite the damage, the school’s unique design caught the attention of DOCOMOMO Louisiana, an organization dedicated to preserving modern architecture. They advocated for the restoration of the school through adaptive reuse, citing its historical significance and architectural importance. The organization produced this short film, “A Plea for Modernism,” narrated by actor Wendell Pierce, to raise awareness of the school’s cultural and historical value and promote its restoration.","popularity":0.4744,"poster_path":"/c2eIKrvbUoZsgiwY7YtWbpwqJZA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hand Crafted Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Plea for Modernism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendell Pierce","original_name":"Wendell Pierce","popularity":1.3959,"profile_path":"/uOsldo9Pkl0E79UbIXX5tZZmC8F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66dc22eb6e465c5781785825","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1032034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Mather","original_name":"Evan Mather","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dc22fa7bf7ef73fdb91efb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33341003","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2eIKrvbUoZsgiwY7YtWbpwqJZA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3134,"name":"louisiana"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
