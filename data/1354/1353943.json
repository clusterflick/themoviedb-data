La gazza ladra (The Thieving Magpie) is set in a time of great social upheaval. When Ninetta is accused of stealing a silver spoon, a series of unfortunate events begins that initially makes the happy ending expected from an opera semiseria seem highly unlikely. What sort of world is it where a person can be executed for the alleged theft of a spoon? Tobias Kratzer, successful as a director throughout Europe, now debuts in Vienna with Rossini’s opera that received its first performance in 1817 and traces the uncertainty felt by people in a politically and socially destabilised world.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":"/vZaUtgFJP4uQ5NXo6WvyYkQlhfp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Musiktheater an der Wien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":198,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Musiktheater an der Wien 2022","title":"La Gazza Ladra","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1559062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Machaidze","original_name":"Nino Machaidze","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/a2eVh4msA8qak62NZXpZ8d0CApA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ninetta","credit_id":"66dd7a24733a1a764c9674ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Maria Capitanucci","original_name":"Fabio Maria Capitanucci","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/ex4QJWBEkylkZjJLQ56wbXEh2dV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fabrizio Vingradito","credit_id":"66dd7ab62bc58c08c7b9443b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina De Liso","original_name":"Marina De Liso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"66dd7ae2892b872103ec6f54","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Mironov","original_name":"Maxim Mironov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gianetto","credit_id":"66dd7b046e465c578178796d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Bordogna","original_name":"Paolo Bordogna","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/znMGipbaFBGAFejGapyJvzkHRBk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fernando","credit_id":"66dd7b2e2c7aed2ab4ee449b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonino Fogliani","original_name":"Antonino Fogliani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"66dd7bda6d8f3fe1736d2749","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gioacchino Rossini","original_name":"Gioacchino Rossini","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/rEOcvlxwKQlOgFpzLPp0Qw6Ig7n.jpg","credit_id":"66dd7ba06c9a1e43079ddc20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Kratzer","original_name":"Tobias Kratzer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd7bba53c9df90e93ab7d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZaUtgFJP4uQ5NXo6WvyYkQlhfp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
