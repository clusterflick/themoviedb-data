Educación ambiental, memoria y no justicia en magdalena","overview":"On the 15th of January, 1999, in front of the coast of Magdalena, at the Río de la Plata, a containership crashed onto a Shell ship. 5.400.000 liters of crude spilled over the estuary waters. Two days later, the southeast wind and the rising tide caused the hydrocarbon to pour into the streams and wetlands, which produced a severe damage to the ecosystem. This film explores the judicial and political plot through documents and testimonies, but it also boosts the collective memory with activities that involve younger generations through a sensitive approach to the land, art activism and environmental education.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":238397,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colectiva Magdalena 318","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spillover efect.
