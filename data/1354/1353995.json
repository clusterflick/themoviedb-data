The camera of the show records the Director of the Planetarium, Dionysis Simopoulos and the astrophysicist George Georgopoulos, preparing a projection of the Planetarium, thus presenting to the audience the way of working for the creation of each program, while then the former talks to us about what is really the Planetarium and what it offers to society.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/32X0Lwkf2ZFroryIDQNYKfLqdnI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greek Scientific Institutions - Evgenidio Planetarium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/32X0Lwkf2ZFroryIDQNYKfLqdnI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
