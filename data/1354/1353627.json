In the former clandestine detention centre Pozo de Banfield, Teresa Laborde Calvo narrates her birth in the car that transported her mother to the place, and Miguel Santucho tells the story of his mother’s last days. Together they walk through the space of memory narrating the way in which they reconstructed their identities, the present of each one and the importance of having dared to find the truth and continue searching for the missing grandchildren.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Facultad de Artes (UNLP)","origin_country":""},{"id":238426,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asociación Miguel Bru","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banfield: Well of Memory and Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Laborde Calvo","original_name":"Teresa Laborde Calvo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66dc748c11cab217566d0bc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel “El Tano” Santucho","original_name":"Miguel “El Tano” Santucho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66dc74957ec73e907e4973f6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristian Jure","original_name":"Cristian Jure","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dc74ace4f25e1852e4122b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
