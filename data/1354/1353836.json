However, the consumption of horse meat is prohibited in Argentina itself and no horses are bred for this purpose in the country. So, with 200,000 horses being slaughtered each year for export to the European Union, where exactly is this meat coming from?  “Cinco Corazones” reveals the grim reality behind the lives of Argentinian horses. These animals suffer many forms of abuse from the moment they are born, only to end their lives being slaughtered for export to the main consuming countries in Europe. The film exposes cultural and sporting practices, political collusion and shady business dealings, which severely harm the health of these animals and constitute animal welfare violations.","popularity":0.2263,"poster_path":"/55l57GJaes9hs7o6TASNDX1qsbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Posibl.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinco Corazones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Parlato","original_name":"Martín Parlato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd29c17170ff75369675c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Solari","original_name":"Liz Solari","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/qVBqgHJTTEvG8cBjBF93FHMG6HD.jpg","credit_id":"66dd2e0a7170ff75369675f6","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Parlato","original_name":"Martín Parlato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd2e3bf4da709e8b3590c9","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929969,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruno Rattazzi","original_name":"Bruno Rattazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd2e74aac3856162fe375c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929973,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Solano","original_name":"Victoria Solano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd2f891f2fd04e0a9a99a6","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florencia Marchetti","original_name":"Florencia Marchetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd2fada618f270d135946b","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929978,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andrés Sentis","original_name":"Andrés Sentis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd301208a0ea854e38bff2","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929979,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Santiago Acosta","original_name":"Santiago Acosta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd30616a0241d9b938c111","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55l57GJaes9hs7o6TASNDX1qsbn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2673,"name":"horse"},{"id":156456,"name":"animal abuse"},{"id":207254,"name":"caballos"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
