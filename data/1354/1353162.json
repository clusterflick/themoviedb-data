Solange, a 23-year-old Rwandan refugee, finds political asylum in Hull with her four-year-old daughter Lisa. Their integration process is fraught with obstacles and nothing goes as planned. Solange forges a friendship with Nyota, her Congolese-born neighbor, who helps her navigate her new home. From the heavy heat of summer to the first snowflakes of winter, Hamwe follows the pivotal moments of Solange and Lisa's journey towards permanent residency. Together is an ode to the land of welcome that is Quebec, but also to the resilience of my mother and the millions of other political refugees and economic immigrants.","popularity":0.2054,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":235963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Ocho Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Together","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Kamugisha","original_name":"Laura Kamugisha","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db21ea2e0bbb0257edfe23","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Kamugisha","original_name":"Laura Kamugisha","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db21f8812bf81813340083","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Auger","original_name":"Jonathan Auger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db2206cdb5716de3dcef87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2080370,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rebecca Dory","original_name":"Rebecca Dory","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db221e7170ff753696338b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4927048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mérédith Gonzalez","original_name":"Mérédith Gonzalez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db223cf1db30c35bcce600","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4927049,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claude Emmanuelle Yapo","original_name":"Claude Emmanuelle Yapo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db224e542c36471c95a2a4","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniela Mujica","original_name":"Daniela Mujica","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db225ef4da709e8b354b62","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Kamugisha","original_name":"Laura Kamugisha","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db227254af0e170e387853","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Idriss Kanago","original_name":"Eric Idriss Kanago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db22822800aef6c53141a6","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6054,"name":"friendship"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":176227,"name":"motherhood"},{"id":210608,"name":"1990s"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":286995,"name":"fiction"},{"id":289049,"name":"refugees"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
