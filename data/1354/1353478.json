Shot over six years, the film brings us the moving stories, dreams, and experiences of three groups of children and teens from different Indigenous nations: Atikamekw, Eeyou Cree, and Innu. In following these young people through the formative years of their childhood and right through their high school years, we witness their daily lives, their ideas, and aspirations for themselves and their communities, as well as some of the challenges they face.","popularity":0.4284,"poster_path":"/2TKt9bG0IKko4iwaV3Pvc7kpBxJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ninan Auassat: We, the Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","original_name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1XpngtObJiZv0rM08bBU3HkiSOx.jpg","credit_id":"66dbeaa5ad858ffdb6dd1164","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228372,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugo Gendron","original_name":"Hugo Gendron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674882ee8bb84ab808cf9acc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415463,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Lachance","original_name":"Alexandre Lachance","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674882f98bb84ab808cf9ad1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799263,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mélanie Brière","original_name":"Mélanie Brière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67488302a65145f558db0096","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1740988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathalie Cloutier","original_name":"Nathalie Cloutier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6748830d8bb84ab808cf9aef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colette Loumède","original_name":"Colette Loumède","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6748831f8bb84ab808cf9af2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35644568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2TKt9bG0IKko4iwaV3Pvc7kpBxJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":236395,"name":"innu"},{"id":293194,"name":"youth"},{"id":313152,"name":"autochtones"},{"id":317544,"name":"atikamekw"},{"id":343020,"name":"eeyou"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RIDM 2024","release_date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
