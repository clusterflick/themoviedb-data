She loves geography, dancing, squishmallows, and video games. But Crystal was born biologically a different gender than she identifies. Her family and friends all love Crystal and accept her for who she is, but the state of Texas does not. In 2023, the Texas legislature made it illegal for doctors to offer lifesaving medical care to transgender minors. When the state threatened to investigate her parents, Crystalâ€™s mother was forced to take her and her brother to another state, leaving her father to work in Texas. This is the story of a little girl and her beautiful family who are unjustly being torn apart over draconian anti-transgender laws in Texas.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/qHBhLJOzSv34Yf9kqqM319HGc57.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crystal: Story of A Girl from Texas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal","original_name":"Crystal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66db9a0c39fd282ef395aa98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth","original_name":"Elizabeth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66db9a1558ee317f1e643ce8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4928016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bubba","original_name":"Bubba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66db9a1ef278f3910d388152","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michelle Mower","original_name":"Michelle Mower","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db99e239fd282ef395aa5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michelle Mower","original_name":"Michelle Mower","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db99e78532c14345dcf9e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michelle Mower","original_name":"Michelle Mower","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db99f223c3761aeef5be6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33427662","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qHBhLJOzSv34Yf9kqqM319HGc57.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
