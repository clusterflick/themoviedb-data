Fistula introduces a complex web of narratives, counterpointing the highly subjective account of a love affair between two women with a bricolage of film and video images. The image and ‘spoken’ computer-generated text exist together in an uneasy coalition, creating a series of possible correspondences which open out a space for associative and provisional readings. A fragmented visual text, identification, phantasy and gender create a dark subconscious space which is both disturbing and fascinating.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fistula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Curran","original_name":"Michael Curran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db82eb49fb42eaf4387b5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4927719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Osnat Haber","original_name":"Osnat Haber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db8300519edd98f8f986fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
