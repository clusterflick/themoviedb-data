While their acquaintance begins with innocuous small talk, the two are intrigued by each other, and, having no other plans, end up conversing (and conflicting) through the night and into the next morning. Anchored by Matt Dellapina’s and Kathleen McElfresh’s performances and featuring original music by Mike Kinsella, “Park Life” continues the tradition of the conversation film, celebrating the value of connection between people while also exploring the anxieties and concerns of millennials turning forty.","popularity":0.2378,"poster_path":"/fzQXreTGvgfACOnaaWFmaJfn9jw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Park Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Dellapina","original_name":"Matt Dellapina","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/4tm6jFo0tbDfMztCd5LnlrS3ac7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"6789aa89c9e03e442d976410","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3209757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen McElfresh","original_name":"Kathleen McElfresh","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"6789aa96c9e03e442d976414","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Haney","original_name":"Tyler Haney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dc8ab763bb4154f6ec5102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312038,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephanie Dufford","original_name":"Stephanie Dufford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789aad2a64feb16c91d6c2e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28799164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fzQXreTGvgfACOnaaWFmaJfn9jw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
