Brick by brick, through encounters and wanderings throughout Port-au-Prince’s neighborhoods, archival photos, graffiti, and animations, the filmmaker introduces us to architect Léon Mathon and the residential architecture of the early 20th century. Over the ruins of her family home, Dominique, the director's mother, an architect like her father and grandfather before her, searches through her memories and significant places for traces of the past and the history of her country. Many of her landmarks are no longer there. From this tragedy arises a quest — a need to reconnect memory and history to understand the present better. The filmmaker follows her mother during her journey, capturing her reflections and conversations and documenting them to bring memories back to life.","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":235963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Ocho Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Living memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4927019,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nitsé Mathelier","original_name":"Nitsé Mathelier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1aef454c1b76e7c5e587","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4927019,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nitsé Mathelier","original_name":"Nitsé Mathelier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1b0073cc9999852761ea","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniela Mujica","original_name":"Daniela Mujica","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1b12e7a4fc1034704304","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Idriss Kanago","original_name":"Eric Idriss Kanago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1b1fd49ec36b1a34d44c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318090,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vanessa Abadhir","original_name":"Vanessa Abadhir","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1b2e4a93d98678749d60","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2903362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrés Solis","original_name":"Andrés Solis","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1b3eec0113d44c5de304","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Kamugisha","original_name":"Laura Kamugisha","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66db1b5024193b7d5221bb0c","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5518,"name":"haiti"},{"id":33574,"name":"childhood home"},{"id":180523,"name":"neighborhood"},{"id":221238,"name":"architecture history"},{"id":248870,"name":"memories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
