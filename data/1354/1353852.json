Caravan is the story of the elephant Pelusa and the historic journey that will make her the first elephant in South America to cross two countries.  Risking her life to touch another elephant for the first time, Pelusa´s caravan will undoubtedly set a precedent that will not only leave the business of elephants in captivity mortally wounded, but will open the possibility for 10 other elephants that are in captivity today in Argentina and more than 40 in the region.  What justifies captivity during a lifetime of a species? Does the fact that the existence of wild animals in zoos continue to be legal makes it an ethical attraction? Is it possible to reconvert zoos into a conservation space?","popularity":0.3303,"poster_path":"/v9R7sQaaOEQtYA4z3RXFpwn9cO3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Posibl.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caravan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Caravan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Parlato","original_name":"Martín Parlato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd35e0da706543f53ab4b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v9R7sQaaOEQtYA4z3RXFpwn9cO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156456,"name":"animal abuse"},{"id":273202,"name":"elephant rescue"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":319029,"name":"elephants"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Caravan  - Official Trailer - #CaravanaMovie","key":"c6MGxWd0RD4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-08T18:10:41.000Z","id":"66dd35966b81db005fc23eff"}]}}}
