By enveloping her with a bright lyricism and a supremely refined orchestration, Puccini reaches the heart of his artistic identity – reminding us of the real pleasure of tears. Conducting the orchestra of the Opéra de Lyon, Daniele Rustioni offers the finest of backdrops to Ermonela Jaho, whose rare combination of force and delicacy has made her a go-to choice in this wonderful yet harrowing role, in which she is making her prized debut in Aix.","popularity":0.1009,"poster_path":"/e5ayFInabrKbf95UoQfKm5etyWE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Festival d'Aix-en-Provence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aix-en-Provence 2024","title":"Madama Butterfly","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermonela Jaho","original_name":"Ermonela Jaho","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/5cXV7EMRi2AUwMNM4KiBuwDib7m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cio-Cio-San","credit_id":"66dd547591fb88a8d8fe38d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Smith","original_name":"Adam Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"B.F.Pinkerton","credit_id":"66dd54912bc58c08c7b9432c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mihoko Fujimura","original_name":"Mihoko Fujimura","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/m7mRqEMLT3uRDALadOsncDpmtpv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Suzuki","credit_id":"66dd54bc91fb88a8d8fe38d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Lhote","original_name":"Lionel Lhote","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sharpless","credit_id":"66dd54c7fc9875513d344484","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902924,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniele Rustioni","original_name":"Daniele Rustioni","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"66dd552a6e465c578178784b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Puccini","original_name":"Giacomo Puccini","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/mAVi1Op8QWvu6QC63nb6tn1MXDm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Composer","credit_id":"66dd58db6a0241d9b938c219","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Breth","original_name":"Andrea Breth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dd5b6ebb7de9f23738bf23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Puccini","original_name":"Giacomo Puccini","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/mAVi1Op8QWvu6QC63nb6tn1MXDm.jpg","credit_id":"66dd5b9befb91a31a5ec71dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fwwqL9hCQgpIJ5qgplDA8N1EdPB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1775}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e5ayFInabrKbf95UoQfKm5etyWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":337621,"name":"verismo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"[ PRÉLUDE ] MADAMA BUTTERFLY — PUCCINI","key":"3W5zBTzsZDc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-29T08:00:08.000Z","id":"66dd5c138098633ddfee43af"}]}}}
