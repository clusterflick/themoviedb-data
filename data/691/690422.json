The heroine doesn't manage to hear the desires in continuous vanity and diligence to keep in the megalopolis. Hurrying on protection of the project on which its future career depends, it nearly doesn't force down the small child who oddly has appeared on the carriageway. In attempt to find his parents, the heroine encounters a number of mystical coincidence, which lead to irreparable consequences. She gets up before a choice to live further or to lose everything and to remain the human.","popularity":0.1668,"poster_path":"/yu89iPD9aOF5mdNpTes23baVuP9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
