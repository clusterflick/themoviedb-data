Jack toys with Pierrot throughout the story, performing a satirical essence of white British sensibility whilst referencing early minstrel troupes’ caricatures of the post-slavery, black populace. Mixed-race Pierrot is encouraged to strive for her ‘white potential’ whilst battling rejection, rage, and the bending of time amidst the English countryside.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/o0Re6pFCLODFwgFbOwxCozyvE4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O' Pierrot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2591240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanoa Sasraku","original_name":"Tanoa Sasraku","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8aa15bc4ad590013fed5d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1086,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o0Re6pFCLODFwgFbOwxCozyvE4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
