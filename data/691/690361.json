Novelist Jonathan Lethem (Motherless Brooklyn, The Fortress of Solitude) plays writer/lyricist/muse to Ranaldo's artist/composer wanderings, across soundscapes created alongside friends and musical guest artists including Nels Cline (Wilco), Sharon Van Etten, Alan Licht, Kid Millions (Oneida), and Steve Shelley (Sonic Youth). Theirs is an unusually intimate and personal process in the creation of Ranaldo's album, Electric Trim (Mute, 2017), a bold, new sound and a lush and striking departure from Ranaldo's signature work.","popularity":0.1451,"poster_path":"/hQ45fOPEgu8PoSEUayFiQmErQZ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello Hello Hello: Lee Ranaldo, Electric Trim","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ranaldo","original_name":"Lee Ranaldo","popularity":0.2286,"profile_path":"/c5nKR4iHOmYJBZTTQMNgqC14TFr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e8b5e21d363e50015b8ba9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Lethem","original_name":"Jonathan Lethem","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e8b5e3affd44d00131b0a28","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nels Cline","original_name":"Nels Cline","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e8b5e5eb18f320016e430d0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raül Refree","original_name":"Raül Refree","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e8b5e799979d20015ee8a84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Shelley","original_name":"Steve Shelley","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/w5M6ORE75yF4BLyLQpcwC5wMkqU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e8b5e80c4ad590013ffb37e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1666080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Van Etten","original_name":"Sharon Van Etten","popularity":0.2188,"profile_path":"/cr92wMXVRJhFGapUQvmJlTywz9X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e8b5e8cffd44d00151b0125","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6808310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5bP7cmzsd9awIY43v09ImqMqSS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQ45fOPEgu8PoSEUayFiQmErQZ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":729}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
