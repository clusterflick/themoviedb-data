Cheesehead Blues Re-Cut is a music documentary on the state of the blues set in Clarksdale, Mississippi, birthplace of the delta blues and second home of Theo Dasbach, founder of the amazing Rock & Blues Museum. In 2011 filmmaker Jan Doense set out on a musical road trip in the Deep South of the U.S.A. While visiting Clarksdale – home of Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Ike Turner among others – he met fellow Dutchman Theo “Boogieman” Dasbach, a former international banker who had been sacked by his employer and then decided to move his enormous collection of blues and rock & roll memorabilia from Arum, Friesland to Clarksdale, Mississippi. This became the Rock & Blues Museum, one of the must-see attractions for any music lover visiting Clarksdale.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/wnaoHryQtOk3BOYXaL7pld72GPO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheesehead Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2593000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo 'Boogieman' Dasbach","original_name":"Theo 'Boogieman' Dasbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e8ca91163e6fb0012851d56","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1148606,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Doense","original_name":"Jan Doense","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/b9leqKgj7g4S3SQxJjcjEUAVfFj.jpg","credit_id":"5e8ca84ce16e5a0017c9a177","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3377360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wnaoHryQtOk3BOYXaL7pld72GPO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
