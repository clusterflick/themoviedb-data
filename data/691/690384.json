Re-telling the tragedy, the film presents the protests against their release from an institution, delves into the backgrounds of the killers, their terrible violent act and the impact it caused in UK. It also explores claims that their punishment has been a sham, as reporter Deborah Davies investigates how inmates at secure units are treated and interviews experts to learn whether eight years has been sufficient time to successfully rehabilitate the pair.","popularity":0.5676,"poster_path":"/cbL6kBs5H83slrK5tiCgTUaPOmk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
