The body swiftly responds even to subtle shifts in everyday tools and regular environments.

Ergonomic syntax, both scientific and fleshy, fuels the film’s idiosyncratic logic and Sagar’s vivid output.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/be2qSRbSSl03VvGBVA8yPdEhTXL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human Factors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilona Sagar","original_name":"Ilona Sagar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8bcd50ad87f7001969bf04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/be2qSRbSSl03VvGBVA8yPdEhTXL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
