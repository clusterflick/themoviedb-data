The film presents two main sets: the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh and a mountainous landscape somewhere in the Highlands. The first serves as the stage for the wanderings of a wolf, while the second hosts a caveman sculptor played by Coombes, along with a cavewoman who entombs his body in plaster. In both scenarios, things seem out of place: a savage creature in a museum and a self-conscious artist in the Iron Age. “Love is tender to impression at the surface, like a rock with deep moss upon it, but there is too much mass of love for it ever to be moved.” – Coombes’ sub-personality as the Pictish Man.","popularity":0.0243,"poster_path":"/wg0iLclpdhJhPTo12AvsmGuuAyp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Discs and a Zed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Coombes","original_name":"Henry Coombes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Caveman","credit_id":"5e8ab1e29979d20017edbe0f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Coombes","original_name":"Henry Coombes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8ab1fab18f320016e35c72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZhMGgSLPHkIsmJFrUlF4fzLtE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2200}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wg0iLclpdhJhPTo12AvsmGuuAyp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
