Joni must choose between her Ph.D. common-law husband and her dream lover. Her father Roland is a salesman with a billion-dollar idea, if he can only find angel investors. Michael has a plan to find the cash. Joni's sister Sioux can become a licensed family therapist if she can keep her hallucinations in check long enough to pass the licensing exam. Filling out the cast are a team of lesbian movers, a teenage boy with a secret identity, a suburban mom who did way too many drugs in the 90's, in the 80's, in the 70's, and in the 60's, and Kelly, a first year pharmacy student - and former beauty queen - who steals drugs to pay her tuition. Thrust together in a series of interlocking stories, these characters must all try and make sense of the strange emotional narcotic called love.","popularity":0.2464,"poster_path":"/zn1iP0GdjoY3jFzDpjVFQYNBgnX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aspirin for the Masses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2591443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Nixon","original_name":"Adam Nixon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8ae960b18f320011e38eb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2591443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Nixon","original_name":"Adam Nixon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8ae966b18f320016e3a6d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4078932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zn1iP0GdjoY3jFzDpjVFQYNBgnX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"St. Tropez International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
