With this vibrant choreography, De Keersmaeker returned, in 2001, to two of her great loves: pure dance and the minimalistic music of Steve Reich. Accompanied by the pulsating tones of his music, for an hour and ten minutes ten dancers occupy the stage, delineated by a curtain of fine strings, displaying an impressive succession of virtuoso dance phrases. The mathematical figures, the sustained repetition, the geometric occupation of the space, the art of continuous variation – everything that had gradually become the choreographer’s signature was pushed to the extreme in Rain.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/xg2k29SPaB8ByYr4Eq9f9BTxJ79.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183882,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","original_name":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8b3365a6a4c1001266d5dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xg2k29SPaB8ByYr4Eq9f9BTxJ79.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1418}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
