It is the moment when day becomes night, when just briefly at dusk, one thing can be taken for another: friend for foe, sleep for death, you for me, dog for wolf. These scenes from a coast where the Roman fleet is thought to have first landed in Britain – in a language thought to be closest in sound to spoken Latin – are part of an ongoing philosophical enquiry set on the Isle of Thanet. The screenplay is adapted from writings by Virginia Woolf and Raul Ruiz.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/h0DEZHlrN3C2qcMFhMz7u6mXtrX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Dog and Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Dogra-Brazell","original_name":"Julia Dogra-Brazell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8dbf8e9f0e190018f3efe6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9436484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyjG7Mf1vuAtbQYisOGHLkzdnqG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h0DEZHlrN3C2qcMFhMz7u6mXtrX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
