The memories, haunted by a Spirit of Seductions Past (played by a quite glorious naked young lady who fortunately bears absolutely no resemblance to Francis Fran cine) suggest a generally lurid life of sumptuous sex and questionable liaisons.  The future, presented by an ancient fortune teller with a wonderful crystal ball that holds a lively go‐go dancer and that seems to mediate between interchanging black and white halves of the screen, follows Francis Francine through the reactivation of an ancient affair, to her death (a jealous ex‐lover) and her triumphant entrance into a pastoral paradise that looks like a cross between several scenes from “81/2” and “The Embarkation for Cythera” in drag.","popularity":0.2608,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming Attractions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Francine","original_name":"Francis Francine","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e8a0a90b84cdd0019a9a634","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tally Brown","original_name":"Tally Brown","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e8a0a9f42f19f0017964382","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1499735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Terry Riley","original_name":"Terry Riley","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c763c80522e325f4918eed","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1136020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Grant","original_name":"Beverly Grant","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8a0a4ab09bde0013cc5fab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Conrad","original_name":"Tony Conrad","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5m5qwalSYvfG2i26w88UTwMFztK.jpg","credit_id":"5e8a0a65278d8a0016e326cb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215645","wikidata_id":"Q29021993","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
