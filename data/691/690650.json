They live from odd jobs. One is an elevator operator in a building, the second is a shoemaker and the third works in the construction sector. The other side of immigration from sub-Saharan Africa. Behind the statistics hide people, bodies waiting to be able to start another life elsewhere. A hotel thus becomes a transit point in which stories and hopes mingle, a place which seems suspended in time and space. A static journey waiting for another to begin.","popularity":0.3538,"poster_path":"/dA4yV0EioIQZPoOOKZtlVVFjjaq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fugues de Barbarie","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"2011-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afric Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SD","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","title":"فندق افريقيا","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nabil Djedouani","original_name":"Nabil Djedouani","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/5cl4aXyFVasb96w3b9D4z7MIeVr.jpg","credit_id":"5e8c8a3f3a340b001603ce37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246208,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Myriam Aycaguer","original_name":"Myriam Aycaguer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8c8a5063e6fb001784edbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hassen Ferhani","original_name":"Hassen Ferhani","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8c8a214b0c633d962c7aec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2261205","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"100043063245082","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGgck5Tdim5GAZu5Lq1FRpKj9TX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tH4sugAaUNbJaZ9WCgB9d5OgFU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dA4yV0EioIQZPoOOKZtlVVFjjaq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGLj6ujCd1T6naNVCImyD0z6MgP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":189126,"name":"north africa"},{"id":256164,"name":"migrations"},{"id":271448,"name":"ethnology"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":325289,"name":"african diaspora"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
