Directed by Rafael Duarte (Bambalaio Filmes) and produced by Leonardo Edde (URCA Filmes), the documentary shows how Roman reached, during his preparation years, 4 of the “7 summits” during winter, considered by many an almost impossible mission. Survivor of the avalanche that hit the Khumbu Falls in 2014, a few feet from Everest Base Camp, Roman returned to the Himalayas four years later with Rafael Duarte and Padawa Shepa, who together documented the most challenging expedition of his life.","popularity":0.2813,"poster_path":"/886AZr7gvpG608SH4aQkrVvYKns.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bambalaio
