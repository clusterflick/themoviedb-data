However, the thousands of people of Itate, situated just outside the zone, and those who had fled the area and taken shelter there were left to their own devices for over a month. Later on Itate became a restricted area and the residents were allowed only visits having to leave the area for good.  The place became a ghost town, as it was too close to the Zone and many pets and farm animals are stranded there. There are said to be 150~200 dogs, 400~800 cats, 50 chickens and a pig although the exact numbers are unknown. The public interest in the accident has all but gone but there is one man who still cares what happens to those animals.","popularity":0.4129,"poster_path":"/et88ElNjjXZ4ACGwVjylt6yUove.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131719,"logo_path":null,"name":"ADG-Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2015-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Contamination of the Title does not refer to the Nuclear Radiation","title":"Hidden Contamination","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunman Hirayama","original_name":"Gunman Hirayama","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e8a2b136e0d720012b0193a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kei Fujiwara","original_name":"不二稿京","popularity":0.2339,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e8a2badfd7aa40019df1171","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166383,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hiromichi Sakamoto","original_name":"Hiromichi Sakamoto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8a2b90fd7aa40019df114b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naotoshi Kitada","original_name":"Naotoshi Kitada","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8a2b5bd2f5b500187abf83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naotoshi Kitada","original_name":"Naotoshi Kitada","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8a2b6dd71fb40015f74d27","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/et88ElNjjXZ4ACGwVjylt6yUove.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2282,"name":"love of animals"},{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":219364,"name":"philanthropy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hidden Contamination -Trailer 【2015 Documentary Film】","key":"lPB9XCP8Pos","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-07-15T11:04:26.000Z","id":"5e8a2dfad71fb40018f75026"}]}}}
