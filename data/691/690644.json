Klaus vom Bruch's torso is inscribed with a rotating computer generated construction (in real: a handmade wooden model put on an ordinary turntable); creating a composite image that metaphorically describes a collapse of the private and public space of vitual media. This spectacle of technology imposed on the human body is accompanied by a haunting soundtrack of traditional songs of the Pygmies. Ultimately, the artist turns his butt onto the viewer, communicating with fundamental body language.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oGtoQIiXTaBlaLSEKy0AztvElms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goblins' Chants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus vom Bruch","original_name":"Klaus vom Bruch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6226ef4d5249780046b7f685","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus vom Bruch","original_name":"Klaus vom Bruch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8c85a6105611001385f052","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGtoQIiXTaBlaLSEKy0AztvElms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":716}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
