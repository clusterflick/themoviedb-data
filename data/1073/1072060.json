Together they go out in to the \"field\" to investigate a child who can actually see Knapp. Once there, the child, Tina Golden, manages to steal their magic, freeing the World's children from nightly sleep, jeopardizing the existence of Fantasyworld and generally unleashing a slapsticky Mayhem on the duo. In the end, both Knapp and the children learn valuable lessons about doing the right thing and the necessity for kids to go to sleep.","popularity":0.9895,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sandman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Susskind","original_name":"Steve Susskind","popularity":0.6057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Early Knapp","credit_id":"655ed3711d356300c408b0e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Walker","original_name":"Ann Walker","popularity":0.3117,"profile_path":"/hR48nkt4PERVlrRkO3c9gfkag4m.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marigold Pixietwiddle","credit_id":"63bce066fa40460094a6e0f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liisi LaFontaine","original_name":"Liisi LaFontaine","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lark (as Elyse LaFontaine)","credit_id":"63bce079a6e2d2007ebac1df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skye LaFontaine","original_name":"Skye LaFontaine","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"63bce085a6e2d20092113430","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake Lively","original_name":"Blake Lively","popularity":3.8597,"profile_path":"/s9DpsGapfJAM2DyuhE2VBW1cKQw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Trixie","credit_id":"63bce09afc31d3008bcf434b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Lively","original_name":"Ernie Lively","popularity":0.5146,"profile_path":"/guIP10XZFN7p6UF6DiP3neSEifP.jpg","credit_id":"63bce0c3726fb10080d99a6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":188824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don LaFontaine","original_name":"Don LaFontaine","popularity":0.2153,"profile_path":"/y6idca1uWKZ5BY8wzn0aaXh0EMc.jpg","credit_id":"63bce142fc31d300a8df0ea1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
