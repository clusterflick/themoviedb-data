The purpose of the early educational system in the Arctic, as with other aboriginal populations, was assimilation – “to take the Eskimo out of the child”. In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper made an official apology in the House of Commons to former students of aboriginal residential schools –  but can the pain ever be erased? Drawing upon archival footage, old photographs, and songs, Kakalakkuvik recounts the vivid memories of students from Port Harrison (now Inukjuak, Québec), the first group of Inuit to sue the federal government for compensation.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Children Dwell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauloosie Kasudluak","original_name":"Pauloosie Kasudluak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09b1df857c00d9c00c4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Naktialuk","original_name":"Johnny Naktialuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09b805a53300c10f6126","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alli Nalukturuk","original_name":"Alli Nalukturuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09bef14dad00bd0a71b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simeonie Nalaturuk","original_name":"Simeonie Nalaturuk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09c7df857c00d9c00c59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louisa Aqriaruk Ningeok","original_name":"Louisa Aqriaruk Ningeok","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09cedf857c00bc209d09","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Putugi Ningeok","original_name":"Mary Putugi Ningeok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09d6df857c0081409bf4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Nulukie","original_name":"Daniel Nulukie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09dee16e5a008ac6ee9b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Kasudluak Ohaituk","original_name":"Anna Kasudluak Ohaituk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf09e8a5743d00dd53c618","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jobie Weetaluktuk","original_name":"Jobie Weetaluktuk","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bf095305a5330085a3f1da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993110,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katarina Soukup","original_name":"Katarina Soukup","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bf0963a5743d00890f3aea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jobie Weetaluktuk","original_name":"Jobie Weetaluktuk","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bf09708efe730094885e85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046324,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Christine Sarda","original_name":"Marie-Christine Sarda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bf0995e16e5a00afca5452","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
