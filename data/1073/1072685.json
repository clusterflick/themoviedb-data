Worse, his beautiful daughter and only child is engaged to a returning World War II veteran who forsakes the oystering trade to take a job with the local newspaper. The cub reporter's first job is interview a New York banker, and former resident, who has secretly come to the Eastern Shore to provide a loan for a beleaguered Latin-American president whose country is battling communist insurgents. Hobbs blames the banker for his home island's destruction; he believes if the banker had approved a loan for a system of breakwaters, the erosion, and resulting loss of fishing habitat, could have been prevented.","popularity":0.7334,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":190228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eastern Shore Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Mr. Hobbs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3867858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Hardwood","original_name":"Jack Hardwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Crad Hobbs","credit_id":"63bed0d1813831008aa3e383","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":215474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Helm","original_name":"Frances Helm","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/sEloahCCGIBvDjcmCgGiymKeUJU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Timmy Hobbs","credit_id":"63bed0e08138310091e52301","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3867862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bolger","original_name":"Robert Bolger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bob Gilly","credit_id":"63bed119813831007d759a3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2209445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Campbell","original_name":"Alexander Campbell","popularity":0.1181,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"E.K.
