But the sixteen year old did as she pleased, devouring life to the fullest. Madly in love with her first flirt of the same age, she falls pregnant with him and decides to keep the baby. She hides her pregnancy from her parents, from the doctors, and come what may. Julie has defied the adult world, armed with a conviction in the form of a lesson for all: it is because life can be short that it must be intense.","popularity":0.3977,"poster_path":"/eNGyNp2d3KdLPXPGb53sBTWwZH5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vema Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulse of Life","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Pulse of Life","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Marivin","original_name":"Anne Marivin","popularity":0.3388,"profile_path":"/us62bYupp3pRzFsmdb4dxOTpVQl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cathy","credit_id":"63bfb1e4a5743d00c3beb31b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3868817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandy Afiuni","original_name":"Sandy Afiuni","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"63bfb2068efe7300c83ef341","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Caravaca","original_name":"Éric Caravaca","popularity":0.2276,"profile_path":"/yJkhAfF1flznA2GzLWah2nDecIa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Christian","credit_id":"63bfb21505a53300c10fb5a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Medi Sadoun","original_name":"Medi Sadoun","popularity":0.3059,"profile_path":"/c2Dm51hgjJ1Wawoq7I0AKEG2YXT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr Garriguès","credit_id":"63bfb22ae16e5a007ea962dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3412071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Biolay","original_name":"Anna Biolay","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/38Qy1LbTM13xJnrtysc0SNZ8kIo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Amélie","credit_id":"63bfb23a8efe730087a7fe0a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Durant","original_name":"Louis Durant","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/tT9zpApjBINo0iRaDsBEoctWNlW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ludo","credit_id":"63bfb244df857c00d9c05ff3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1557728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Madénian","original_name":"Mathieu Madénian","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":"/9P4kyQL7QyRAYriQATLhej9Wt0E.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Professeur de pâtisserie","credit_id":"63bfb25305a53300c10fb5c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1968570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Valding","original_name":"Esther Valding","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/u4AgyhMzx6TQRv7kMHYVPshmx2Z.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vanessa","credit_id":"63bfb260df857c00d9c06007","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Cuche","original_name":"Nicolas Cuche","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/heWFGowDm2VFudT6qYr7G4b6H8v.jpg","credit_id":"63bfb1cea5743d00c3beb305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2288967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Spitzer","original_name":"Florian Spitzer","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/eizTyGa89qEqoWGA0su8BHwzk3u.jpg","credit_id":"63c01ba6df857c0081412297","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3096816,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Caroline Franc","original_name":"Caroline Franc","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c01b8ddf857c00d9c08ba4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26220292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k9pVz83BW68nC5HS8HCljGJKOEc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2732},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1151,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hjLaXmIxXLRr3zWwg5CQuxbGgIR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/eNGyNp2d3KdLPXPGb53sBTWwZH5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hJG7Hj5gaBXFCNyzNWYVCRwvJFk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"M6","release_date":"2023-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
