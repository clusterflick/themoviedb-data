There are six people aboard a boat, two silent musicians, two boatmen speaking Irish, two women, English. One boatman's brother is on the run from the police, one of the ladies has lost her wedding ring.  Macalla Chill Áirne, as well as being a recreation of a Victorian era tour of Killarney,  culminating in a musical performance by the Eagle's Nest mountain, also echos conflict and delves into the chasms that appear when cultures clash. The Victorian tour of old ended with the loud report of a cannon resounding through the surrounding wild.  In loving memory of Séan Garvey, ar dheis dé go raibh a anam dílis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dBRBg99KzJQq9WvcxECPKPFdB5L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killarney Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","title":"The Killarney Echo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779287,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Des","original_name":"Des","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Diarmuid","credit_id":"63bdc6d3a6e2d2007ebb332e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathie Richardson","original_name":"Kathie Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eleanor","credit_id":"63bdc7aafa404600aeff0022","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seamus Barra Ó'Súilleabháin","original_name":"Seamus Barra Ó'Súilleabháin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Partlán","credit_id":"63bdc7befc31d30092c64dbf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles O Brien","original_name":"Charles O Brien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bdc7dda6e2d200db5bcada","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13196838","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dBRBg99KzJQq9WvcxECPKPFdB5L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":588}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":310921,"name":"killarney"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Macalla Chill Áirne (The Killarney Echo) | Short Film, 2021","key":"jB70Zz-2Y_E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-16T20:00:11.000Z","id":"63bdc820a6e2d200a8673281"}]}}}
