Each full of struggles and unimaginable hardships. The illusion of wealth, success and fame crumbles into worthless dust in their minds. The history of Tibetans is the story of one of the greatest spiritual civilizations in human history. Its culture was valued and respected by scholars far and wide. Despite this, the Tibetans were pushed to the brink of extinction. In 1951, Tibet became part of China and suddenly the traditional culture was subjected to the pressure of an unknown ideology. The Tibetan landscape began to acquire a new face. Even Lhasa, the place of the gods, has changed beyond recognition, but the words of the Buddha, translated long ago into Tibetan, have preserved their message to this day: the path to liberation begins in each of us, and each of us has the prerequisites for achieving lasting happiness.
