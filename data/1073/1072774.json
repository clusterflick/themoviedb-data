Following the death of her husband, Anni pursued his dream of justice, continuing to live and work in Palestinian camps. The film is titled after a fairy tale that Ghassan had written for his niece Lamis, which is a metaphorical narration of the development of a bottom-up democracy that can break down the barriers of refugee camps and overcome indifference through engagement and culture. The narrative frame of the film consists of a laboratory, conceived and coordinated by the director, in the kindergarten created by Anni in the Burj elBarajneh refugee camp. It ends with the staging of the theatrical adaptation of Ghassan’s fairy tale in two theatres in Beirut. The documentary style and that of the fictional story alternate, as do the two narrative temporalities, that of a painful past and present, where pain finds its meaning","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Lantern","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Rizzi","original_name":"Mario Rizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bf0b87a5743d00c3be61a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10983194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sySGLtiNWxDOdqfrggcoe4jPNg1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGbxCQ2G4FTcmArEsA9rwaGggC1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
