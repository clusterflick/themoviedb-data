It was a unique consolidation in the history of North Carolina. Virtually every other county grew up around a single, central municipality. From the start, however, Forsyth County had two – delineated only by the centerline of a street. Merger: Making the Twin City takes the viewer back in time for an informative and entertaining look at the origins of Salem in 1766, the establishment of Winston in 1849, and their sometimes rocky path to consolidation as North Carolina’s “Twin City.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v5eTM3he6s9ao9RTi333sChiJnA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190113,"logo_path":null,"name":"City of Winston-Salem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Merger: Making The Twin City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Alexander","original_name":"Roy Alexander","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63bcbcabfc31d30092c5c56e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Elliott","original_name":"Frank Elliott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcbcf369d280008aca35c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Elliott","original_name":"Frank Elliott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcbd13fa404600e63bc9bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Elliott","original_name":"Frank Elliott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcbd20fc31d30081adb942","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865561,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larry Bell, Jr.","original_name":"Larry Bell, Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcbd3e5be00e007c59c3a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865563,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Everett","original_name":"Joel Everett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcbd5afc31d30092c5c629","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ed McNeal","original_name":"Ed McNeal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcbd7ffc31d3007e326793","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5eTM3he6s9ao9RTi333sChiJnA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
