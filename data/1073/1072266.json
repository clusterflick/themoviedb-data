In the face of the sexism of a dual society that divides and opposes, a society that makes violence, domination, and profit its principle generators of value, she interrogates the potential for shifting our gaze in order to deconstruct these systems and erect new ones that value our capacity to exist in an emancipatory benevolent collective exchange reflecting life itself.\r Can we envisage a revolution in the symbolisms that operate in our minds and in our bodies, and offer a definition of the Masculine other than a virile and dominant bareness born of an inflicted schism with the Feminine? Can we reawaken the memory of a universal and multiple Feminine? Can we liberate the Feminine within each human being?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XXY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
