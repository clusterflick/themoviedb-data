For this staging it has more than 20 artists of the new generation, all of them possessing a great talent and very recognized in their field, exhibiting a lively, brilliant show, full of strength and energy. The dance, composed of 8 excellent dancers is presented with its varied samples of the traditions acquired over the years and its use of new trends such as jazz and contemporary.
