For Verdi’s wonderful ambivalent hunchback, paradise is the peaceful home and family that he struggles to protect.  Opéra Orchestre national Montpellier Occitanie’s production of Verdi’s opera confronts the two faces of Rigoletto: that of the loving father-monster who locks up his daughter from the very first scene, and his alter ego, the modern-day buffoon. While the latter, like a comedian alone on stage, sneers at power and the elite, the former reveals his darkest fears and persecution complex.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/7JkX1G96dJhTC2LfHUL6VGmKnq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigoletto - OONM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gezim Myshketa","original_name":"Gezim Myshketa","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63bd513cae6f093c82edf951","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3844116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Muzychenko","original_name":"Julia Muzychenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63bd5143ae6f093c429d50d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rame Lahaj","original_name":"Rame Lahaj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63bd514a5be00e00937dca0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2157566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luiz-Octavio Faria","original_name":"Luiz-Octavio Faria","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63bd5151a6e2d2008b3f3bc2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rihab Chaieb","original_name":"Rihab Chaieb","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63bd5159fc31d3007e32c8bd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roderick Cox","original_name":"Roderick Cox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bd516af85958007d36e922","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Ève Signeyrole","original_name":"Marie-Ève Signeyrole","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bd5175fa404600e63c24ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JkX1G96dJhTC2LfHUL6VGmKnq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
