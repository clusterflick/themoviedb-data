The play’s original chronology has been broken up and fragments of Peer’s life reordered – all observed by an aged spirit who is on the threshold to the other side. Maurstad’s acting is “overwhelmingly great. He carries the role of Peer Gynt on his 92-year-old shoulders. This is pure theatrical magic.”","popularity":0.2232,"poster_path":"/b0uisjPqIjrORt03FMPCPviRd4V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belvedere","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peer Gynt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toralv Maurstad","original_name":"Toralv Maurstad","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/yNjXr7HhUUHNT8NSsjn12Qb70Zm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Old Peer Gynt","credit_id":"63bf572aa5743d00b0be6efb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svein Tindberg","original_name":"Svein Tindberg","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":"/pFK0lygHhCF7bbV8CHrhab1H7oH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Button-moulder","credit_id":"63bf573ca5743d00890f58ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Jørgensen Dragland","original_name":"Ingrid Jørgensen Dragland","popularity":0.2015,"profile_path":"/o0Qz5k7mE5mS0OXCiP9Xe8zihSc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mother Aase","credit_id":"63bf574b05a53300e99ac4eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1904884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Khorami","original_name":"Sara Khorami","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/jh49k9oVAVGdApgSCiRyJmrAgoG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Solveig","credit_id":"63bf575ae16e5a00afca7255","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Grønli","original_name":"Jan Grønli","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/Hda6AAaOfr5jEBUfH6iTmreQuy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e636be050f14e4fccf4882","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Remlov","original_name":"Kai Remlov","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/rTNt3qjs0IzWmLywUvOCSZwNQPf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e636d5e8211ecd22b05260","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geir Kvarme","original_name":"Geir Kvarme","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/8c9TEIKObyOuiJGGdMkW4xE2zwv.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e636e0050f14e4fccf4895","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul-Ottar Haga","original_name":"Paul-Ottar Haga","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/7IFB53Srn2CzzZKMoCBvLbBVfen.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e636ecdd224d1a399120c6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pål Christian Eggen","original_name":"Pål Christian Eggen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e63701050f14e4fccf48b2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1479297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Vidar Lende","original_name":"Karl Vidar Lende","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/hqs8io5DRHtg6oVLhukBxG8K9lJ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e63710e8211ecd22b05277","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1822261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niklas Gundersen","original_name":"Niklas Gundersen","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/84gXuugHyyXtSTQNQcVXTUqQXFG.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e6371f050f14e4fccf48b9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Fuglevik Urstad","original_name":"Jonas Fuglevik Urstad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Peer Gynt","credit_id":"66e6373b9dfbbdf0e6cf428a","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jae Nyamburah","original_name":"Jae Nyamburah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"The Mountain King","credit_id":"66e6377ddd224d1a39912125","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anette Amelia Hoff Larsen","original_name":"Anette Amelia Hoff Larsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Woman in Green","credit_id":"66e6378edd224d1a39912146","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Frogner","original_name":"Charlotte Frogner","popularity":0.3446,"profile_path":"/xAaBmAepMzWoHuoI5sl1feYEKYx.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Woman in Green","credit_id":"66e637c5dd224d1a39912172","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Unn Vibeke Hol","original_name":"Unn Vibeke Hol","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/oxaf1n6yx6Lnf80TWwSifE86s3M.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Kari -
