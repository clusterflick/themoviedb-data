The film moves in the free-flowing memory tracks of a small indigenous people and tries to create a common memory image of the past 100 years from the diversity of the protagonists. The focus of the film narrative is the Russian territory of their homeland \"Lapland\", which is now divided between four countries.  Grandmother of Zoya Mikhailovna was born in Finnish territory.  In 1937, this was sufficient reason to upset the father of the little Zoya. Together with Zoya 18 Sami people of Kola Peninsula recall their past life memories in film.  The past and the present flow into each other. However, you can feel a huge gap between \"today\" and \"yesterday\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cj7p7BHUDbZPxDa8kxK3s1qH1Xs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habitat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3874032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pola Rader","original_name":"Pola Rader","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c42198d7fbda008206ff13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cj7p7BHUDbZPxDa8kxK3s1qH1Xs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
