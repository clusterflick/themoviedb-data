His swift and dramatic demise at the early age of 37 in 1982 left behind a vacuum in European filmmaking that has yet to be filled, as well as a body of unique, multi-layered and multifarious work of astonishing consistency and rigour. From 1969 onwards, Danish director and film historian Christian Braad Thomsen maintained a close yet respectfully distanced friendship with Fassbinder. Fassbinder – Lieben ohne zu fordern is based on his personal memories as well as a series of conversations and interviews he held with Fassbinder and his mother Lilo in the 1970s.","popularity":0.4577,"poster_path":"/m3QYpCWa6TD8mm0FnNq4AwJYQrc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kollektiv Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fassbinder: Love Without Demands","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Fassbinder – To Love Without Demands","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Fassbinder: at elske uden at kræve","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Werner Fassbinder","original_name":"Rainer Werner Fassbinder","popularity":0.5153,"profile_path":"/xll1qAg0TOzcuNlfZWEEKB1JxqR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"54e0664fc3a36855c7002f57","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54e06656925141027c0049ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Baer","original_name":"Harry Baer","popularity":0.2348,"profile_path":"/vTuAZ6bZyi7BUs9G1cZLbQR0s7U.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54e0665e925141469f002fd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Schober","original_name":"Andrea Schober","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54e066679251411956005328","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilo Pempeit","original_name":"Lilo Pempeit","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/cKTUKW1TLHqi86hgNMRwiii8eLQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"54e06670925141454f002bd2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margit Carstensen","original_name":"Margit Carstensen","popularity":0.2414,"profile_path":"/3o7Nl96wQI7WRMI1beZwGtLCcKz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"54e06678925141194b005472","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Braad Thomsen","original_name":"Christian Braad Thomsen","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/zUr1PgDziuFF5q2eVF1i4g4CXWr.jpg","credit_id":"54e0663fc3a368454d0051f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4290342","wikidata_id":"Q19816657","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2144,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m3QYpCWa6TD8mm0FnNq4AwJYQrc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
