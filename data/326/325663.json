Think South Pacific, candy-colored, rum-infused cocktails with names like the Shrunken Skull and the Missionary's Downfall, crazy Hawaiian shirts, exotica music, and a nonstop party scene inhabited by self-styled nonconformists. That was then. Today, tiki has been embraced by a coast-to-coast underground hipster subculture of former punk rockers, vintage junkies, and escapists. Featuring historians and hula dancers, master mixologists, mermaids, and more, Plastic Paradise is your ticket to this little-known, fascinating scene, including a pilgrimage to the famed Mai-Kai Restaurant in Fort Lauderdale for Hukilau, an annual anything goes celebration that draws Polynesian popsters from all over the world.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Paradise: A Swingin' Trip Through America's Polynesian Obsession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett O'Bourke","original_name":"Brett O'Bourke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3ca6664f71600c8318599","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2421960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
