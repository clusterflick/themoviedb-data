It locates the event within the struggle between white authority and black youth, in this case over the contested spaces of the carnival, and reflects on its history as symbolic act of resistance. The film makes the case using montage: cutting carnival scenes with archive news reports - police surveillance to rioting in the street - and crossing looks of desire with alienation, from police to reveller, woman to man, man to man. Add to this a disembodied, political critique and trenchant images of police violence and the audience soon becomes aware that the documentary itself is part of the resistance.","popularity":0.2019,"poster_path":"/ogacEPIKLw4gKnN77NYZWPWbFqY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sankofa Film & Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Territories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Blackwood","original_name":"Maureen Blackwood","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/gltjCxJstRyGJlP0qNGqBUTHJQp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54e39157c3a368454d009c4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Graal","original_name":"Kevin Graal","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54e391629251417add00170e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Julien","original_name":"Andrea Julien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54e391699251412c8e003a7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nadine Marsh-Edwards","original_name":"Nadine Marsh-Edwards","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54e39175925141195600a0d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia Thomas","original_name":"Antonia Thomas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54e391ad925141195a009e82","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Julien","original_name":"Isaac Julien","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/3I1Su7TgaUYy1tecYUHDqTrzR2F.jpg","credit_id":"54e39131c3a36848970018d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0144638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jyyJdPRs7pylVSWP0ATiceWdRSV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ogacEPIKLw4gKnN77NYZWPWbFqY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
