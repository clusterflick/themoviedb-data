We see a housewife in a tastefully colour-coordinated kitchen equipped with the latest electrical appliances as she prepares dinner for her husband and his business associates. While the dishwasher takes care of the dirty dishes, she bakes a cake and puts a roast in the oven. As it cooks, she’s off to the theatre… Mrs. Mortimer Jones promotes not only Edison, but also Natalie Kalmus’ subtle sense of colour and the “home cooking” principle of the Technicolor franchise.","popularity":0.8951,"poster_path":"/sYQVeQd5GGvyNA9bly3Ny3IMWQM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202460,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Rodney Gilliam Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Mortimer Jones Prepares \"Dinner for Eight\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4118881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Robertson","original_name":"Alice Robertson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Mortimer Jones","credit_id":"648f62fb2f8d0900e3861ca5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gayne Whitman","original_name":"Gayne Whitman","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":"/mmA7RqxEK6XMxrtsiRqSEQgKuDT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"648f630e0f0da50139036c44","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Gilliam","original_name":"Rodney Gilliam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54df3c4dc3a36855c70011fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Natteford","original_name":"Jack Natteford","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648f624142bf0100c7fc13ca","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361978,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Natalie Kalmus","original_name":"Natalie Kalmus","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/lj8ZQL6PPxKM4Rtg0rf0q5MANhX.jpg","credit_id":"648f629b559d2200ff1180d4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Color Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32996,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ray Rennahan","original_name":"Ray Rennahan","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648f62c842bf0100e49f3f67","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sYQVeQd5GGvyNA9bly3Ny3IMWQM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1918,"name":"cooking"},{"id":10637,"name":"food"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
