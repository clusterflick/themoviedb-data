It's a very raw view into what drives these friends, and why someone might have committed murder. This ultra-low budget film is shot completely in real time and with a single camera move. There is a bit of strong language, adult situations, and very mild violence.","popularity":0.2158,"poster_path":"/2AzbUiwQ3tbOyw50Krv2tEprgrY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Died","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Bloch","original_name":"Lisa Bloch","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Courtney","credit_id":"5d15589950f7ca0030140c15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Calvert","original_name":"Bill Calvert","popularity":0.2861,"profile_path":"/u0VjXyNPWbbH3FSzd3FdeoC648J.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"5d1558b850f7ca0030140cd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulric Dihle","original_name":"Ulric Dihle","popularity":0.0562,"profile_path":"/vuRM08qiQVaFh9NELuqIcCfDNa4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Medic","credit_id":"5d1558d171ffdf3f68868deb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eero Johnson","original_name":"Eero Johnson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Medic 1","credit_id":"5d1558ef71ffdf001586c10b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Jones","original_name":"Dustin Jones","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"5d15590a18b75100245c3af2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2349322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Atwood","original_name":"Marc Atwood","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d15586a50f7ca001e14119a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2349322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Atwood","original_name":"Marc Atwood","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d15585e18b751001c5c35cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396647","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2AzbUiwQ3tbOyw50Krv2tEprgrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
