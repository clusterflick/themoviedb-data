Australia will soon become the world's biggest gas exporter as more than 30,000 'fracked' wells are sunk in the state of Queensland where Dayne lives. He and his neighbours have unwittingly become the centre of a massive industrial landscape and they have no legal right to stop mining on their land. Dayne embarks on a journey that transforms him from conservative pig-shooter to sophisticated global activist as the Frackman. He meets the people drawn into a battle that is crossing the ideological divide, bringing together a peculiar alliance of farmers, activists and political conservatives. Along the way Dayne encounters love, tragedy and triumph.","popularity":0.5979,"poster_path":"/w5i3QMEa1DM2z9wprjILPlZGNdD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freshwater Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":46471,"logo_path":"/ofN5hTzZzgaPjXtsazK38JxqRPO.png","name":"Smith&Nasht","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":46472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquarius Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When governments fail us, ordinary people have to become heroes.","title":"Frackman","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayne Pratzky","original_name":"Dayne Pratzky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54dd400692514103bb00002c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Hutton","original_name":"Drew Hutton","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a3373979251415475022b87","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johnathon Stack","original_name":"Johnathon Stack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54dd3fe892514103bb000025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Todd","original_name":"Richard Todd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54dd3fc492514103bb00001a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3557446","wikidata_id":"Q19627428","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a3eHT4ELAHt2KmGVotFPKCdYLDN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w5i3QMEa1DM2z9wprjILPlZGNdD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"},{"id":206044,"name":"fracking"},{"id":206282,"name":"advocacy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Frackman The Movie | OFFICIAL TRAILER","key":"-ifUjjP3aL4","published_at":"2015-02-12T13:31:04.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54dd3eff9251417feb000002"}]}}}
