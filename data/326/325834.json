These songs are the roots of Estonia’s renowned singing culture. Based on the continuous repetition of eight-syllable verses, they produce a haunting sound able to connect the fleeting present with the eternal circle of life. Against the stunning setting of modern Estonia, this film explores how Regi songs still fire the imagination today, weaving together people and nature through song.","popularity":0.4567,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regilaul - Songs of the Ancient Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137518,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Veljo Tormis","original_name":"Veljo Tormis","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/2NtEWOZtNwgf9Egsfq3Mi0WetSv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54e2fce1c3a3684897000d71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauri Õunapuu","original_name":"Lauri Õunapuu","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54e2fcea925141195a009452","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meelika Hainsoo","original_name":"Meelika Hainsoo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54e2fcf4925141469f0072dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urmas Sellis","original_name":"Urmas Sellis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54e2fcfdc3a368087b002ff7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaak Johanson","original_name":"Jaak Johanson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/qXlWin30jVs4JmaNGXo7FMiWH2u.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"54e2fd05c3a3684897000d77","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaan Kaplinski","original_name":"Jaan Kaplinski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"54e2fd19c3a368454b0085e8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ulrike Koch","original_name":"Ulrike Koch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e2fa0d925141469f0072a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ulrike Koch","original_name":"Ulrike Koch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e2fa1fc3a368454b0085bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pio Corradi","original_name":"Pio Corradi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e2fa2d9251411953008e70","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28459,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rose-Marie Schneider","original_name":"Rose-Marie Schneider","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/j3znqf2llW167HUbeQdrbTVyDEq.jpg","credit_id":"54e2fa409251412c8e002f9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2649084","wikidata_id":"Q55542376","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210543,"name":"traditional music"},{"id":210544,"name":"estonia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
