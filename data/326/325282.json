The city retained the title of the world's busiest port until 1985. Symbolized by its towering skyscrapers, the city continues to attract people from all over the world, earning it the coveted title of \"Melting Pot of the World\". The \"Big Apple\" has had its share of great moments and some forgettable ones as well.This Video presents an exhilarating picture of the many ethnic groups that have made New York their home and contrasts these with some pathetic visuals of New Yorkers who lived in pitiful conditions under the shadows of the mighty skyscrapers in the first half of the 20th century.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Historic Travel US Many Faces Of New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
