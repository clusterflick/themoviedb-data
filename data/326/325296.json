Within several months, they are to construct a park in Jinhua, intended to form the centre of a new district of that town. Where green fields now flourish and farmers plough the land, investors will soon flock, followed by new inhabitants and political reforms. But the project ends up being drawn out over years. The euphoria of the early stages runs up against a reality in which torn-open earth and the ambitious hopes of politicians, workers and locals are the only manifest features. The film documents the changes leading to the Jinhua Architecture Park - from the laying of the foundation stone to its final opening. In giving all participants in this process an opportunity to comment.","popularity":0.1121,"poster_path":"/b0mVSZDrenL5HX7K7X3lZKPRX5l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52966,"logo_path":"/cd4lBKeO8zcp4ZLTAMCsijXQAuh.png","name":"Mira Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2010-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House In The Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hercli Bundi","original_name":"Hercli Bundi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec11fb8346007eb805e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hercli Bundi","original_name":"Hercli Bundi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec1fc15f89007c12080a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hercli Bundi","original_name":"Hercli Bundi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec30a6e2d2007ff5acab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hercli Bundi","original_name":"Hercli Bundi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec3ca4af8f00911d20d6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018881,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Mennel","original_name":"Pierre Mennel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec4d0e29a200810f486e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hercli Bundi","original_name":"Hercli Bundi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec5ec15f89007c120819","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286843,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gregg Skermann","original_name":"Gregg Skermann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec7190ea4b0091a97b9d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3729288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roman Bergamin","original_name":"Roman Bergamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec84a6e2d2007a2f898f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Lemp","original_name":"Paul Lemp","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eec943dc3130079fae376","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Becker","original_name":"Patrick Becker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633eecaaa6e2d2007ff5acc7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1682978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3GNJoz0WbwTOat78C8tAWZFP6JD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b0mVSZDrenL5HX7K7X3lZKPRX5l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nyon, 16e Visions du Réel Festival international de cinéma Nyon","release_date":"2010-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milan, 15th Milano Film Festival","release_date":"2010-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
