Tarzan, the Gigolo, Andynamite, Priscilla, La Rage, Eddie Dark... they all dream of becoming professional wrestlers, like their teacher. Salvatore fought with top wrestlers for more than 30 years, particularly within the prestigious WWF. Today, he has decided to bring his students to the U.S to follow the traces of his past. Waiting for the big day, they live out their passion together, sometimes taking foolish risks to satisfy the local audience and lay out their future.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/sfct7i0k14QqrDx3z4xJ8nvdmNy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46750,"logo_path":"/rDqY6EqEL6V3DV0HhMj8TtVyeDo.png","name":"Off World","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":7465,"logo_path":"/e28RwIpRcOSFaeKkzLQBzvMXbK0.png","name":"Novak Prod","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2013-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamcatchers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Bellomo","original_name":"Salvatore Bellomo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/wQ4ClgKgAqjZrR6o2idBvFPhB05.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54e3269fc3a36823d4000888","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Dark","original_name":"Eddie Dark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54e326a9c3a368454d009464","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Le Boucher","original_name":"Jean Le Boucher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54e326b4c3a368087b00329f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cédric Bourgeois","original_name":"Cédric Bourgeois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e326d5925141469f0075f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Seron","original_name":"Xavier Seron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e326e4c3a368489700107a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Seron","original_name":"Xavier Seron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e326ee92514119530091c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cédric Bourgeois","original_name":"Cédric Bourgeois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e326fbc3a3685756007f60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cédric Bourgeois","original_name":"Cédric Bourgeois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c51dcfc3a3687cbc005d29","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xavier Seron","original_name":"Xavier Seron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c51de19251411b3a0063eb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774797,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Naas","original_name":"Julie Naas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c51df19251411b44006719","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Origan Cannella","original_name":"Origan Cannella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c51e039251411b40006367","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yann-Elie Gorans","original_name":"Yann-Elie Gorans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c51e139251411b3a006435","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122405,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jef Aerts","original_name":"Jef Aerts","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c51e25c3a3687d2e00587b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3809494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sfct7i0k14QqrDx3z4xJ8nvdmNy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
