He meets up with Noelle, who seems intrigued by his restlessness - until her economist boyfriend shows up. Yet plot details do little to convey the power of the film, which lay in its capturing the anarchic texture of William's life - a life whose lack of direction was read as a rebuke of the Swiss myth of orderliness and self-satisfaction. With his roots in documentary, Soutter excelled at creating a loose, vibrant cinema, full of quick zooms and dynamic hand-held shots, with dialogue that often alternated between outright quotations and stylized interviews.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/spWB5UyBMOa2vA5JHqwggTA64V5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1967-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon by Our Teeth","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Wissmer","original_name":"William Wissmer","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"William Tudor","credit_id":"65c29b289603310162b7b1e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noëlle Frémont","original_name":"Noëlle Frémont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Noëlle Laurencin","credit_id":"65c29b2f95acf001621b71bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4522031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Fidanza","original_name":"Michel Fidanza","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Vogel","credit_id":"65c29b3b8c0a48016484e770","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Haufler","original_name":"Janet Haufler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"La comédienne","credit_id":"65c29b4295acf001831b75c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3279501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuela Dahm","original_name":"Manuela Dahm","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"La chanteuse US","credit_id":"65c29b4a3fe7970162fd8979","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Soutter","original_name":"Michel Soutter","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/59YjNkBxFzYuAwlD4ofGGgiKfJK.jpg","credit_id":"54e1cfa3925141195300709b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Soutter","original_name":"Michel Soutter","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/59YjNkBxFzYuAwlD4ofGGgiKfJK.jpg","credit_id":"65c29abde7c0970164cf0998","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476856,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Oser","original_name":"Anita Oser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c29ac5e7c097017dcf0da7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Soutter","original_name":"Michel Soutter","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/59YjNkBxFzYuAwlD4ofGGgiKfJK.jpg","credit_id":"65c29acd8c0a48016484e70e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Olivier","original_name":"Jacques Olivier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c29ad49603310184b7b6c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927112,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eliane Heimo","original_name":"Eliane Heimo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c29ae1e7c097017dcf0dbd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Charles Pellaud","original_name":"Jean-Charles Pellaud","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c29aeee7c097017dcf0dc7","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607873,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Zeller","original_name":"Jean Zeller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deadd295c5cc80018cac7b0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1271979","wikidata_id":"Q17632021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/spWB5UyBMOa2vA5JHqwggTA64V5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
