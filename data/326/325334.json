Jean-Louis was a 25-year old virgin when a free-spirited young Parisian woman was temporarily stranded in his village after a bus broke down. She left him a changed man, and she also left a match book from a fast food restaurant called Fast Burger. Soon after his grandfather passes away, the innocent rube Jean-Louis hops on his bike and embarks upon a quest to Paris to find this enigmatic woman. But he is not prepared for the size of Paris, and instead ends up working at a Fast Burger outlet himself. Jean-Louis is a simple soul and freely expresses himself without guile. For some reason this endears him to the staff and management; soon he has been promoted into the upper echelons of the company. One day he meets a rather ditzy Metro security guard, Henriette, who is also at sea in the big city. The kindred spirits click and a sweet romance ensues.","popularity":0.275,"poster_path":"/Ai1vJjK5Mv8SEJXbV27h5nP3Azl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12389,"logo_path":"/6yilbEvoHtPcTb4LwAueAq091iT.png","name":"Les Films Pelléas","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":84502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Bois Sacré","origin_country":""},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fast","video":false,"vote_average":6.053,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Gélard","original_name":"Frédéric Gélard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/tesuXaBAsIOTBXJWBvszFI39DnY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jean-Louis","credit_id":"593697129251416c1d00d7a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Stévenin","original_name":"Jean-François Stévenin","popularity":0.2535,"profile_path":"/4NjAxLYSPlIqOkxJruq5njTUmpX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Francis","credit_id":"59369722c3a3685aa900cf8a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Viard","original_name":"Karin Viard","popularity":0.4518,"profile_path":"/quIomRrFBxXq32K5MBuvaTR3xBk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"La fille aux cheveux jaunes (comme des frites)","credit_id":"593697339251416c0100d487","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Schmidt","original_name":"Nathalie Schmidt","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Henriette","credit_id":"5936973fc3a3685a7500ca3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Claisse","original_name":"Georges Claisse","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/aQKmG6aDPVgx8ltolX2HaMIYh4A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Humbert","credit_id":"593697549251416c1d00d7f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Crauchet","original_name":"Paul Crauchet","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/z7ZT4vyrxaVDC5e9Xx8GBx3Nfj4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pépé","credit_id":"59369765c3a3685a7500ca5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaël Baron","original_name":"Gaël Baron","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gaël","credit_id":"593697a0c3a3685ae200db37","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dante Desarthe","original_name":"Dante Desarthe","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c244aa0c3a3686ffff08f50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109772","wikidata_id":"Q3067085","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.734,"height":999,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/Ai1vJjK5Mv8SEJXbV27h5nP3Azl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":733}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
