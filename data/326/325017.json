The video beautifully weaves personal images and audio recordings of a very intimate nature, binding the personal with the political.  Reading aloud from letters sent by her mother in Beirut, Hatoum creates a visual montage reflecting her feelings of separation and isolation from her Palestinian family. The personal and political are inextricably bound in a narrative that explores personal and family identity against a backdrop of traumatic social rupture, exile and displacement.","popularity":0.0972,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Western Front Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measures of Distance","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1426156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona Hatoum","original_name":"Mona Hatoum","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/rWGpaR0TISItRcrI8fA9IZjDjOo.jpg","credit_id":"54dbc360925141618c00249b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205526,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Iain Macanulty","original_name":"Iain Macanulty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aaaf9c3a3682915a02d30","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Bull","original_name":"Hank Bull","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aab1592514122b86baf58","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Craig","original_name":"Kate Craig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aab1f0e0a2655f43803da","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397283,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chick Rice","original_name":"Chick Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aab370e0a2655e9380a43","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205526,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Iain Macanulty","original_name":"Iain Macanulty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aaae8c3a3682915a02d2c","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205527,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cornelia Wyngaarden","original_name":"Cornelia Wyngaarden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aab0a0e0a2655f2380de7","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2090565","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
