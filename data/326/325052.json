An old man, as old as the hills, lives alone in a remote hut. The winter is so cold that he can barely move his limbs. When a robin flies against his window and falls to the ground the old man first has to pause for thought. Then he pushes open the heavy front door and stomps outside to help the bird. Out in the deep snow his strength begins to fail him. But no sooner does he take the tender creature in his hands than a change comes over him. Life radiates in luminous colours and returns to the old man's hut. As it used to. Or is this just one last memory? An inventively animated rumination on love, on bidding farewell and the cycle of life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ocean Pictures Filmproduktion Memmingen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Man and the Bird","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430303,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Riet Hannah Bernhard","original_name":"Riet Hannah Bernhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea25459251412eb400488c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430297,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tobias Böhm","original_name":"Tobias Böhm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea24d99251412eb1004b5d","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430299,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Wittmoser","original_name":"Christian Wittmoser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea24ef925141117c004318","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Stein-Schomburg","original_name":"Dennis Stein-Schomburg","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea24a2c3a36836ed004ea0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roland Fischer","original_name":"Roland Fischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea2599c3a36836ea004d28","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430304,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Gabriel Sahlmüller","original_name":"Gabriel Sahlmüller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea25579251412ebd004b0d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Stein-Schomburg","original_name":"Dennis Stein-Schomburg","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ea2475c3a36836ed004e90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Höhl","original_name":"Thomas Höhl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54dc5bd8c3a36812330037ed","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Stein-Schomburg","original_name":"Dennis Stein-Schomburg","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54dc5b5b925141618c003506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roland Fischer","original_name":"Roland Fischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54dc5b69c3a368122a003564","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426265,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christoph Neugebauer","original_name":"Christoph Neugebauer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c13e3cbf09d1014aa7a26b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430301,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Svenja Matthes","original_name":"Svenja Matthes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c13e2ebf09d10184a7fd9d","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Maaß","original_name":"Daniel Maaß","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c13e24031deb0162f0b2f7","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4400184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Old Man and the Bird","key":"121256842","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-03-04T15:32:08.000Z","id":"60b8f0256dea3a006f73d06f"}]}}}
