Abou Kees was an old Arab folktale of an angry figure who came after mischievous children and took them away in his bag. What if the tale was just an imaginative take on a real person that people feared to approach? The type of person filled with explosive anger that’s been bottled up for years, created by the weight of an unjust world order. Is it possible to see ourselves in Abou Kees? What would we be able to uncover if we truly recognized the monsters within ourselves and others? The Weight of It All explores the recognition of collective trauma in everyone and the search for the real mischievous children, the true reason behind the emergence of our inner Abou Kees.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weight of It All","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5748491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melinda Mouzannar","original_name":"Melinda Mouzannar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee263a7d8d5273099defbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
