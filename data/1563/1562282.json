The project revisits and re-examines Koki's work in Ghost:2565 Live Without Dead Time, Eating an Apple While Lucid Dreaming (2022). Activating Archive: Eating an Apple while Lucid Dreaming 2568 (2025) explores experiential history and speculative futures through investigating Thailandâ€™s sociopolitical history and nocturnal landscapes in an act of collective memory-making. Tanaka works alongside research material and findings gathered through Host:2568 members, including Weerapat. The collaborative work investigates how individual experience and summoned histories can be shared with broader audiences. Interpretation of a Dream (2025) investigates and focuses on the bus driver from Eating an Apple While Lucid Dreaming in 2022 as the main subject to narrate the stories through his own perspective.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interpretation of a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
