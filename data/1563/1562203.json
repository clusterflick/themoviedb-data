Ruprecht, in love with Renata, wants to free her from the madness, but all his efforts are in vain. She goes to the monastery, but here too she is being haunted by the image of the fiery angel. The Inquisition accuses Renata of witchcraft and sentences her to death. Prokofiev's Fiery Angel is one of the outstanding operas of the 20th century. With her production, director Andrea Breth moves the action from 16th century Germany to the sterile environment of a modern psychiatric ward.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lwGHrYFHqMlxhi8JUU7mRIuobXH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fiery Angel - Theater an der Wien","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aušrinė Stundytė","original_name":"Aušrinė Stundytė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Renata","credit_id":"68edc47c4ae6d256af7853dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Skovhus","original_name":"Bo Skovhus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wK6k0oyZlMJLqLM9Ew2sQHdgtCO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ruprecht","credit_id":"68edc490cf349fb678d694fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1017358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natascha Petrinsky","original_name":"Natascha Petrinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hostess / Abbess","credit_id":"68edc4ab7306849501f12079","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1582252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Zaremba","original_name":"Elena Zaremba","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/5mFsxxYJr2ebqr2zowdcZupflDw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Fortune-Teller","credit_id":"68edc4c2caf7b786d6282826","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Schukoff","original_name":"Nikolai Schukoff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tpFSo3wdT7qtNmVeRBdRbZK4H7O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Agrippa von Nettesheim / Mephistopheles","credit_id":"68edc4dc6ed776030f282756","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3844117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Tikhomirov","original_name":"Alexey Tikhomirov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Inquisitor","credit_id":"68edc50648e64c2f0ea21a23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Butter","original_name":"Markus Butter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mathias / Faust","credit_id":"68edc52952690e6b685eeb35","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Owens","original_name":"Andrew Owens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jakob Glock / A Doctor","credit_id":"68edc54a48e64c2f0ea21a27","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Breth","original_name":"Andrea Breth","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68edc5ab581aacaf5c5eeaab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1273,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwGHrYFHqMlxhi8JUU7mRIuobXH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Prokofiev: The Fiery Angel from Theater an der Wien","key":"gl78Wh_H3Oo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-10T11:53:40.000Z","id":"68edc6afff818a3bbf282889"}]}}}
