The video uses character models that represent censorship as symbols, and utilizes the game engine and simulated cluster motion algorithms to create a large number of aggregated character models that unconsciously contract with the sensation of impact and influx of people. The scene uses basic geometric modeling, textureless maps, and broken graphics in an attempt to reflect on what constitutes a digital ruin, an abandoned area in cyberspace, and the state of an unoccupied server.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mQXxrwxFl4g7Z4K9fAcMfDGmdXy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intrusion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1130,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mQXxrwxFl4g7Z4K9fAcMfDGmdXy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":791}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
