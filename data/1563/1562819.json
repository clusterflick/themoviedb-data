Gradually, the filmmaker’s images of the city become testament to the gulf between her Nanbapa’s life and her own, as her attempts to align his memories with the spaces she encounters are repeatedly frustrated. Blending narrative, archival footage and objects with home videos shot by the filmmaker’s mother, the film becomes an attempt to negotiate the gaps and fractures which emerge out of displacement, diaspora and generational trauma.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Losing Your Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arjuna Keshvani-Ham","original_name":"Arjuna Keshvani-Ham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eecccc7fc1e55c9caedc81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
