In an era of digital, emotional and urban noise, the film offers a slow, physical meditation on how we hold complexity. Performed by Juno award-winning musician and composer Ben Brown, the film helps us re-imagine the modern drum solo by using movement to communicate the energy of sound. Filmed in Vancouver, BC’s Downtown eastside the film traces a journey from the streets to the studio. Sounds spill from the drum kit into the streets playing with our perception of noise, disorder and sacred space. The contrast between Vancouver’s raw street energy and the sterile stillness of the studio raises critical questions about how the broader world lives inside us—even in our most private rituals. A mostly improvised performance, this piece seeks to find solace in the unknown by asking not “who loves me?” but: “how do I live with the not knowing?”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They love me / They love me not / They love me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5749856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lydia Hol","original_name":"Lydia Hol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eecaddf518539d0e40ca6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
