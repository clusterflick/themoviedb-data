Born in Burchard, Nebraska, on April 20, 1893 Lloyd was acting at an early age with theatrical repertory companies. He made his film debut as an extra in a 1913 one-reel film for the Edison Film Company. He became friends with another extra, Hal Roach, and when Roach formed his own film company, he invited Lloyd to join him. Lloyd found the idea that was to become his trademark, and change him from a good comedian to a major star: the glasses. Lloyd persuaded Roach and his distributor to abandon Lonesome Luke and in 1917 Lloyd shed grotesque comedy clothes and characterizations for a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. In doing so, Lloyd created an American archetype, an optimistic and determined go-getter sporting spectacles and a toothy smile.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rCjsBAtcqzpyXnYMyFtDSStvGhB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HAROLD LLOYD COLLECTION (9 Discs)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Lloyd","original_name":"Harold Lloyd","popularity":0.3066,"profile_path":"/alOOCzYnr08aEYekwsA3onrdeXk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68ed536b5094d3069a0d7d2b","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCjsBAtcqzpyXnYMyFtDSStvGhB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
