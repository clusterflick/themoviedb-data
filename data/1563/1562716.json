With two weeks to go in the regular season, Simms was lost for the remainder of the year and it would be up to an untested, back-up, Jeff Hostetler to lead the team into the playoffs. Although he had thrown barely more than 100 passes in the previous six seasons, Hostetler exceeded all expectations, winning five straight starts including a victory over the Bills in Super Bowl XXV, one of the most exciting games in Super Bowl history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zLp8jw4aDzfZezlFuBftmEtQSdx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America's Game: 1990 New York Giants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec Baldwin","original_name":"Alec Baldwin","popularity":2.1356,"profile_path":"/hzKy7x574eeUS3wt1R3yvWBRpeR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68eea26311ed311a8ff96830","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zLp8jw4aDzfZezlFuBftmEtQSdx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
