But when Tim surprises her with a storybook Christmas-in-New-York proposal, she falls into her old ways, setting the storybook on fire and retreating back to Los Angeles and away from Tim.  Heartbroken, Lydia moves in with her parents (yes, all four of them) and tries to pick herself up, but finds bad choices around every corner. In an effort to stop the spiraling, her parents throw a New Year's Eve bash with every eligible bachelor they know.  Wooed by everyone at the party, Lydia finds Tim has one more surprise in store. Showing up before the clock strikes midnight, Lydia must wade through this minefield of suitors to prove the one love she is addicted to is Timâ€™s.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A holiday rom com for those who love love.
