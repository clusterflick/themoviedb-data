The film celebrates images of togetherness, care and sensitivity at the Mr. Artist Barbershop in Vienna. Filmed by hand, the camera stays close to the protagonists. The body rhythm of the filmmaker is written into and onto the film exposures and converses with the experienced hand gestures of the barbers. Through craft and artistic expression, two forms of work enter into a sensual and transformative dialogue with each other. The analogue, warmly coloured and abstracted 16mm exposures are interwoven with an immersive and nuanced sound space composed by musician Rojin Sharafi.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lydia Nsiah","original_name":"Lydia Nsiah","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee94d40d6118a48cf09dff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
