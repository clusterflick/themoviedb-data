With no way out and no clue who has confined them, they are forced to rely on each other for survival. As fear and uncertainty mount, a tense bond forms between them—one that blurs the lines between trust, desire, and control. The confined space becomes both refuge and prison as emotions intensify and reality begins to distort. When an ominous red light suddenly flickers on, the truth behind their captivity—and the fragile nature of their connection—is finally revealed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3291204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Powell","original_name":"Justin Powell","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/43N6sfvw8jK14j8JCI5n0KpWaUc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef55082a9d9ea240cac0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2517087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffry Batista","original_name":"Jeffry Batista","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef63c3adc3c7a2f9694f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Burgos","original_name":"Danny Burgos","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef6d1b09e936cc4adc7a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Hartsfield","original_name":"Brandon Hartsfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef7f644d2f8de5f0a051","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2933942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madelin Marchant","original_name":"Madelin Marchant","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef88bedc19e27d40ca9e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruben Rabasa","original_name":"Ruben Rabasa","popularity":0.7387,"profile_path":"/terEHwAQdJ2XnzZIWu1C7Jccfkm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef9644cb3c61ca095fdf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5750028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Raven","original_name":"Chad Raven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"68eeef9f5459903f8a095eb2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":426570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Lavan","original_name":"René Lavan","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/rmQGiLGgEelZNHIMWFOWhMIkxyH.jpg","credit_id":"68eeef40d2a63b3f1af09f9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38524033","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/myQCTRP6PlYiVLxXrZ9EuVjIpme.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kinqxAWvll8IzVVAUyO252D9aa8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
