Mopping the floor can be a privilege, a cigarette can buy you a foot massage, and a single candy might cost someone’s loyalty.  The filmmakers spend several days with women recently released from prison to learn what life behind bars is truly like.  Through their stories, the film explores how hierarchies are formed, how survival depends on small trades and fragile trust, and what freedom feels like after years behind walls.  A raw, honest look at a world where human emotions become the currency of survival.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":275809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kollektiv_doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind bars, everything has its own price — and its own rules.","title":"Women’s Colony: How Does It Really Work?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
