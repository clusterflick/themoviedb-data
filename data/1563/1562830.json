Upon contact with the sea water, the skin and body transform into a gateway to an inner fissure, revealing a complex emotional portrait manifested as fragments of sharp, broken glass, submerged in the sea. As the shards continue their descent, images blur into progressive patterns that expand and contract culminating in a visceral and cathartic transformation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Waters that sculpt fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5749899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Ioudina","original_name":"Victoria Ioudina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eed083dfea770e48aedcf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter","release_date":"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
