Silhouettes explores the fragility of memory and the impossibility of retaining what fades. Some sequences are created using the innovative multi-layered pictures technique, separately treating the layers that make up the picture – the three RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colours, light (gamma) and transparency (alpha). This approach gives the film a unique texture. The visual material itself becomes a metaphor for memory: unstable, fragmented, yet strangely persistent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silhouettes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4065139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannik Ruault","original_name":"Yannik Ruault","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee3420bce41a32a4f1223d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
