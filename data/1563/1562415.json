Hamas identified the Sderot Police Station as a key target. Dozens of terrorists, armed with automatic weapons and missiles, stormed the building, faced by only several police officers. Through outstanding monologues, video segments, security footage and communication recordings, the story of the battle is retold powerfully, up to the dramatic decision to destroy the building. Survivor testimonies offer a double image: that of heroism of policemen and women, who battled to prevented mass killings, but also the neglect, the chaos and the loneliness of those injured police officers, who were trapped in the building as their peers tried in vain to rescue them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sderot Police Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35661150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
