Сколько можно заработать?","overview":"We’ve all heard about the gold rush in Alaska — the dream of finding fortune in the wilderness. But it turns out you don’t need to travel to the ends of the Earth to search for gold.  There’s gold even in the forests near Moscow. Without wasting a moment, the crew heads out with a pan and a camera, determined to find it.  Their journey takes unexpected turns — questions of legality, failed attempts, sudden discoveries, and the thrill of the chase.  What starts as a simple adventure turns into a reflection on dreams, luck, and the myth of easy riches.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":275809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kollektiv_doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The gold rush isn’t just in Alaska.","title":"Searching for Gold in the Moscow Region","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
