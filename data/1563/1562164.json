This is because autism is highly complex and can manifest in many different ways. Some of those affected can live lives similar to people without autism, while others require lifelong care.  The causes of autism are also a mystery. Scientists around the world are working to find out why the brains of people on the autism spectrum develop differently. This would help medical practitioners to establish reliable methods of diagnosis and effective therapies. The documentary explores what \"living on the autism spectrum” means for those affected, accompanying autistic people in their daily lives and showing the challenges they face. It also follows two renowned autism researchers, Tony Attwood and Professor Ludger Tebartz van Elst, dispelling prejudices that many people have about autistic people. Because, as experts remind us, autism is a very diverse condition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autism: Understanding the ‘spectrum’","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
