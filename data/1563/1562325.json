Chico, the main character in Leendert's life, is a deeply wise Ara. Leendert shares his unconditional love for her through spending day and night with her around home. Traditions like showering after waking up in her bedroom keep them tied tight to each other. While Chico keeps on growing, with a life expectancy of 90 or 100 years, Leendert knows he is becoming older and more fragile. When Leendert's health is deteriorating, his main worry is that Chico keeps on eating and drinking. He wonders who will be taking care of Chico if he won't be able to do it anymore. The symbiotic relationship between Leendert and his parrot symbolises humans' longing for connection. In the visual yet poetic experiment, we explore Leendert's intimate relationship with his Ara. How far do you go for your love?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4506156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie van Bree","original_name":"Sophie van Bree","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee20981337a3fdbf78548b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38629107","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
