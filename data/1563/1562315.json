In The Boys of The Barbara we see three friends from the former year 6, Obayda, Praise and Xavier, all from different cultural backgrounds, who end up separated at new schools. Their beautiful former school now sits empty, waiting for a new purpose. The boys sneak back inside and share memories of their time together as they show us around. What did the closing of their school mean to them? What remains of their friendship after being split up? Together, they share enormous insight into their feelings around this huge event in their young lives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boys of the Barbara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5748439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabienne Boekel","original_name":"Fabienne Boekel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee1d3b34cc5c70dd785535","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
