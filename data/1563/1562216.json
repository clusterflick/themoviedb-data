The waterfalls are kitsch, in that they have a 'designed for television' profundity. Situated in a public space, like Masons Screen, I imagine the video as a storefront television from a Superman cartoon, the ones Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, and a crowd of onlookers, gather in front of to see what Superman is doing. In this case, Superman isnâ€™t quite sure what he is doing. Like television news, it is sort of hollow.The text describes a moment of crisis, without providing much detail. These waterfalls transition into a series of spinning objects, of various scales, collected with a rapid, sincere dance beat. Muffled dialogue sporadically intrudes under the footage.\" - Artist Statement","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waterfall Confessional","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5748126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Macdonald","original_name":"Theo Macdonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68edcf4f5117b951705eeb42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
