Against the backdrop of their long-standing friendship, the film explores both the contrasts and harmonies between two entirely different artistic philosophies. In her dialogue with stone, Miroslava Nová allows nature itself to speak, rejecting human intervention and striving for purity of form and meaning. In contrast, Květa Monhartová perceives painting as a space for embodying personal experience and emotion. Beyond a subtle reflection on friendship, the film reveals how essential artistic creation is for both women as a means of self-discovery and expression of personal identity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pF8j3So371gRRtrDCKFcwLyAqn2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Memoria artis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2025-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Encounter with Shape and Color","title":"Diptych","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2404142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Štěpán Havlín","original_name":"Štěpán Havlín","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/tvWaBvGMT4SzV0cEFQCbkuNdRNi.jpg","credit_id":"68ee5a949b6b1748bb0d8193","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4973879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vojtěch Kemenny","original_name":"Vojtěch Kemenny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5a9c517948a33d9df140","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2404142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Štěpán Havlín","original_name":"Štěpán Havlín","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/tvWaBvGMT4SzV0cEFQCbkuNdRNi.jpg","credit_id":"68ee5aa9a74e75c78a5eef19","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4973909,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eliška Karasová","original_name":"Eliška Karasová","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5ab2957ff22b25a72fa8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4973884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barbora Vitáčková","original_name":"Barbora Vitáčková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5abe0a40e73bfda21e25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4973887,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matouš Felkel","original_name":"Matouš Felkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zYfW2McSi4AXXIjlv1DMOYumRlM.jpg","credit_id":"68ee5ac839803cde3c9df27b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4973913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nella Bicanová","original_name":"Nella Bicanová","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5ad01355c90ee05eef8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Tabery","original_name":"Daniel Tabery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5add8c3c90444f9df2dc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4973883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jiří Kejkula","original_name":"Jiří Kejkula","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5ae9f8bbb7f6770d81ea","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4973921,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Petrek","original_name":"Jan Petrek","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ee5b01422811bc9c7855bb","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_3166_1":"CZ","iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/3fQqjail3ZvHmvK3Q6PWFeDkMpv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pF8j3So371gRRtrDCKFcwLyAqn2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
