Once, locals hunted for the valuable scrap metal. Now, only 75-year-old Albert Loginov and his hyperactive dog still venture into the taiga.  The filmmakers join them on a journey through this surreal landscape — discovering toxic remnants, explosive stories, and bizarre sights hidden among the trees.  Collecting Rocket Debris in the Taiga is a portrait of curiosity, danger, and devotion — where space exploration meets the human need to find meaning in what’s left behind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":275809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kollektiv_doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The world’s largest space junkyard lies deep in the Russian taiga.","title":"Collecting Rocket Debris in the Taiga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
