The glass swirls consistently, set atop a hidden turntable. The hypnotic, droning tone from the glass draws focus to the physical gestures. They’re stilted, unsure and tentative. This dance of the wrist and fingers is in reference to the clunky and sometimes difficult learning associated with transitioning. Female associated behaviours are internalised at a much younger age for cis women than they are for a trans women, this works speaks to the process of learning that I am currently within.\" - Artist's statement","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drip, release, in complete memory ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5748088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miranda Bellamy","original_name":"Miranda Bellamy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68edc41a39803cde3c9df065","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
