Writing female driven shows that powered through the 1960s,70s and 80s. In this 90-minute special we pay tribute to her three most famous shows. From the flat-sharing young girls-about-town in The Liver Birds, to the bored, frustrated housewife Ria in Butterflies, and the Boswell family in 80s hit Bread.  Featuring classic clips along with recollections from the stars and fans, we hear from Wendy Craig how Butterflies nearly never made it on air due to its adultery storyline. John Nettles remembers being cast in one of his very first TV roles as Sandra's boyfriend Paul in The Liver Birds.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comedy Classics: Bread, Butterflies, & the Liver Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30872832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
