In this piece, I wanted to convey the calmness of my exterior versus the intense inner emotions that come with opening myself up. I do this by using a macro lens to capture fabric, bright colors, and anxiety-inducing imagery (interior). The drawn images are battling between wanting to be geometric and industrial vs. organic and natural. I pair this imagery with my melancholy cover of Robyn Hitchcockâ€™s song Vibrating, performed and recorded by myself. By using the calm audio vs. the chaotic imagery of geometric forms turning into organic ones, I explore the unnatural feeling of removing walls.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vibrating","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4755797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsay Moore Robertson","original_name":"Lindsay Moore Robertson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665fb48442ddecd191bc234d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
