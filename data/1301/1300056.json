Schaffner as Auteur","overview":"Franklin J. Schaffner is the man behind a great many iconic American films: Planet of the Apes (1968), Patton (1970), Papillon (1973), The Boys from Brazil (1978), and others. Though he was an often enigmatically quiet but no less confident and decisive filmmaker, seldom was he discussed as an \"auteur\" director, despite his Academy Award win for Best Director and many august institutions naming coveted awards for \"excellence in directing\" after him. Daniel Kremer takes a deep dive into Schaffner's distinguished career, examining visual and thematic tropes that render his work extremely personal and part of a vast picture.","popularity":0.1555,"poster_path":"/nJyyu12d8byjBdhgDxAw2gDJ7h9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival Scars: Franklin J.
