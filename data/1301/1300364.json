He wrote his Chronicle anticipating by 213 years the ascent of Mont Blanc accomplished by Balmat and Paccard on 8 August 1786. 450 years after the feat, the film recounts the climb, narrated by Francesco De Marchi's own words, with spectacular images of the climb among the calcareous rocks of the Corno Grande.","popularity":0.2261,"poster_path":"/yWl2tKrTTSqXpIXpknl6sA9oWmI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visioni Future","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE FIRST ASCENT TO CORNO GRANDE SUMMIT OF GRAN SASSO OF ITALY (2,912 M ASL) MADE IN 1573 BY FRANCESCO DE MARCHI, A MAN AT SERVICE OF MARGARET OF PARMA (AUSTRIA)","title":"Monte Corno - I Thought I Was Flying","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Poggio","original_name":"Massimo Poggio","popularity":0.2878,"profile_path":"/6jnTbkdPZ9mWdTZZ0fsQ7VnghxB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Francesco de Marchi","credit_id":"66603af3816365125bb744c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hervé Barmasse","original_name":"Hervé Barmasse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3u0tUye0yXyEbXaMEMRohpsaH5H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66603afc63568ec529511957","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Cococcetta","original_name":"Luca Cococcetta","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b0abea6e1649240d5ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756536,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marco Zaccarelli","original_name":"Marco Zaccarelli","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b148fdc6d374bb745a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Cococcetta","original_name":"Luca Cococcetta","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b25bab4c60da1dddf0e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756538,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ettore Vozza","original_name":"Ettore Vozza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b31c0a33e8d447d8a24","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756539,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Federico Martusciello","original_name":"Federico Martusciello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b3bc7c16b68af57523d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756540,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roberto Parisse","original_name":"Roberto Parisse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b462cb9c86408e99049","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756541,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Attilio Carota","original_name":"Attilio Carota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66603b53b3937c74f7c90865","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2179038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego La Chioma","original_name":"Diego La Chioma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802f54465c00a25a5d96594","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWl2tKrTTSqXpIXpknl6sA9oWmI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trento Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
