And what is HOME for you? Why did you think a year ago that HOME was where your people were? And now you don't even understand where it is, and you can't find the boundaries of this word in yourself... Abroad is about uncertainty, about a constant feeling of guilt and an uncontrollable desire to return, but where to? HOME. Four letters. One word. War. Thousands of confusing and incomprehensible emotions that you feel for the first time. The paradox is that you had to lose everything to find these three letters in yourself. The war provided an opportunity to understand the real value of this word.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fkQyOQmoIpCFlzXPveGTMdy5csr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Парадокс","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4755279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Tatarynova","original_name":"Maria Tatarynova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f6d7e65c93ec086f22599","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4755283,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Volodymyr Postupnyi","original_name":"Volodymyr Postupnyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f6dea25cd5286c3f22576","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32543698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fkQyOQmoIpCFlzXPveGTMdy5csr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Brno, public screening","release_date":"2023-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Vzájemnosti Czech-Ukrainian Theater Festival","release_date":"2024-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"PARADOX\" | Ukrainian short | trailer","key":"gKFNj4VBSJo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-01T17:43:53.000Z","id":"665f6d30549661d2cbbc1396"}]}}}
