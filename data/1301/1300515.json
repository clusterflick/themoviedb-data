In this hostile land where nothing grows, people have managed to survive only thanks to a spectacular age-old hunt: the traditional and sacred harpooning of sperm whales. Despite danger and hard lives, the villagers have always been self-sufficient, living according to their traditions, far from globalization. But today, this balance is about to be broken. As people from a neighboring island start fishing with dynamite, the whales are disappearing. With no more whales to hunt, Lamalera is dying.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lamalera, The Ultimate Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
