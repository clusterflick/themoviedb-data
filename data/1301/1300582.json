Avildsen Before Rocky","overview":"John G. Avildsen has only recently cemented his reputation as the \"king of the underdogs,\" owing to his having directed both Rocky (1976) and The Karate Kid (1984). Within the last decade, a feature-length biographical documentary was released and a critical study book was published. But before Rocky, he was an astute chronicler of the counterculture, whose films possessed a rugged street aesthetic. Those early films (including Joe, Guess What We Learned in School Today, Cry Uncle, Save the Tiger, and The Stoolie) are evaluated for assuming an alternate posture on the counterculture happenings of the era.","popularity":0.0909,"poster_path":"/kIZlQC1acOIvNTdM5nPGAqlPAO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before he was King of the Underdogs, he was King of the Counterculture!","title":"Ammo for Shooting Clouds: John G.
