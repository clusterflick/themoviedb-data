The film explores how Christians seeking proximity to power has led to a hyperpartisan Nationalistic posture that is demonstrably hindering the witness of Christ. As exiled citizens of a superpower nation, Christians' deepest allegiance must be to the peaceful Kingdom of God, and from that posture they must always speak truth to power...no matter the cost.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Evangelicals in the Shadow of Christian Nationalism","title":"Postcards from Babylon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2354734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Peters","original_name":"David Peters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ad497e84abe79ba5716b74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15160924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
