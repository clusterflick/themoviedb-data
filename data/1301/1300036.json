The answer: Working with deep coordination â€” a single homelessness response systems plan based on the principles of Housing First with community buy-in from law enforcement, judicial systems, business communities, service providers, volunteers, and leadership from the mayor and county executive, all working from the same page.","popularity":0.1103,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230667,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Bigger Vision Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Bridge: A Solution to Homelessness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4755020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Sawyer","original_name":"Don Sawyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f4a3433d981b13dc27627","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786978,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Don Sawyer","original_name":"Don Sawyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f4a404e213be43df3e4e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4755021,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tim Hashko","original_name":"Tim Hashko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f4a54b98fe3cffdc276cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4755021,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tim Hashko","original_name":"Tim Hashko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f4a607e74ce5723235539","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BEYOND THE BRIDGE (trailer 1)","key":"912434315","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-13T01:32:57.000Z","id":"665f4a8ea09ebeb935658268"}]}}}
