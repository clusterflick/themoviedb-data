I discovered a strange scene when I was watching a video of a movie she was in. In one scene of a musical, Kajol throws a dove into the sky, which then falls to the ground. This would not be OK on a Japanese movie set. So I thought about the differences between Indian and Japanese movies. By the way, I read in a book that there is a goddess of cinema in India. I guess she protects Indian movies. So, is there no god of cinema in Japan? Oh, but not of cinema, there is a god of dance. I started writing a screenplay with this goddess, Ame-no-Uzume, as the main character, but the Yatagarasu, the guide for nation building, fell to the ground, and the story ended happily.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/hkQBz2WwpAt5Ov00Trus9AVQ77g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kajol's Pigeon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikio Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎幹夫","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/djBtyiHT9PMItgTkTVcjglqlIe7.jpg","credit_id":"6660763b4b6051ed1a43a54d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hkQBz2WwpAt5Ov00Trus9AVQ77g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
