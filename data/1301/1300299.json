Interim contemplates the quiet suspension of the present day environments and practices around these spots. In a floating and dreamy observance, the presence of human beings is paid little more attention than that of plants, rocks, insects and the wind. Through the insistent use of overexposure, and almost silhouette-like burn out images, the holes in the ground become fix-points for the cameras journey through an all too bright over-ground world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2gvnirRR2HBX1e3hswlIjMrTzuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Arts Foundation","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helene Garberg","original_name":"Helene Garberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66601e155e9156e94f76ce84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4756342,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustavo Abascal","original_name":"Gustavo Abascal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66601e27816365125bb743a1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3517718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2gvnirRR2HBX1e3hswlIjMrTzuW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de l'Histoire de l'Art","release_date":"2024-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
