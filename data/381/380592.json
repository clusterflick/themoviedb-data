All focus is on the 43 people between 9 and 78 years old. They have one thing in common, this is the first time in their lives they climb up to the platform to make the decision whether to jump or not. The situation itself highlights a dilemma: to weigh the instinctive fear of taking the step out against the humiliation of having to climb down.","popularity":0.6336,"poster_path":"/b78qdKxzyw80iIjPn7T7Bp8DWan.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8483,"logo_path":"/lKMQtwKjBzhOvmylMImqzPazKwz.png","name":"Plattform
