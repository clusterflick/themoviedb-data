It is an example of the philosophical underpinnings of Lovecraft's thought and fiction. Fans of cosmic horror should have no trouble discerning in Plato's allegory the roots of Lovecraft's theme of awakening to a vast and terrible ultimate reality The filmmakers have brought Plato's pedagogical story to life by shooting over 4,000 still photographs of John Grigsby's wonderful claymation. The unique look of the film was achieved by use of candlelight in a real fire that burned at the back of the set.","popularity":0.1925,"poster_path":"/fwhKT2V547DZfMedvONwcrvbHFy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cave: An Adaptation of Plato's Allegory in Clay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Ramsey","original_name":"Michael Ramsey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ac9e18c3a3681c5c005f2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1338565","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmIKw2xnXB69UcDDJrl2Sirbfa6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fwhKT2V547DZfMedvONwcrvbHFy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":333813,"name":"allegory of the cave"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Boulder International Film Festival","release_date":"2008-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
