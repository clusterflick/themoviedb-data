In a master piece of military diplomacy he persuaded Filed Marshal French to join the Attack on the exposed flank of the Germans as it wheeled to the east of Paris. The battle was indeed a miracle, with the British playing a key part alongside the French in halting the German advance and driving them back behind the next river â€“ The Aisne, where the Allied attack crossed the river and up onto the open ridges of the Chemin des Dames. The Germans held firm and Field Marshal French ordered the BEF to dig-in as a temporary measure but the line moved but little here in the next four years.With neither army able to make headway against modern small arms, the machine gun and quick firing artillery in a conventional frontal battle, the armies raced to redeploy into the uncontested ground north to the sea.","popularity":0.0678,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battles of the Marne & the Aisne","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Church","original_name":"Ed Church","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b09208c3a3686477001e52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Peters","original_name":"Mike Peters","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0921cc3a3686472001dbb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0923092514156be00169a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Oldfield","original_name":"Paul Oldfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b09245c3a36864750021da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b09257c3a36864800022ae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0926ac3a36864820021c0","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
