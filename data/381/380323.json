She thinks he’s an autistic loafer. He’s enrolled at the University of Nizhny Novgorod and is supposed to be watching online lectures, but his mother says all he actually does is hang around watching TV. Oleg doesn’t have any need for friendships, either. Marina wants him to improve his life and subjects him to a series of unconventional treatments. In one particularly uncomfortable scene, we see the therapist riding him as if he were a horse. Another psychiatrist tells Oleg how useless he is and that he will always be alone. Strangely enough the camera seems to be welcome everywhere, and it closely follows these dramatic developments.","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":"/dd2ZCkxkmphdqozpyMXDtycVLTK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Juan","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Maximov","original_name":"Oleg Maximov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56ade2f0c3a3681c54008f3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerzy Sladkowski","original_name":"Jerzy Sladkowski","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/6kiGlDiCE5APrAOwBuSxVumb6Gs.jpg","credit_id":"56ade28ac3a3681c54008f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5229198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uwemMDRLIRJqCfr4CpJf8x35Yl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dd2ZCkxkmphdqozpyMXDtycVLTK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
