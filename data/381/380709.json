For some of us, it feels like we're constantly on the brink of losing it, where it doesn't take much to get angry about anything. And this kind of anger can be seen everywhere we go—at work, in traffic, at the store, at home. But what is really at its root? Anger is often looked at as a bad thing, but are there things actually worth getting angry about? Maybe if we had a better understanding of our anger and where it comes from, we could learn how to channel it toward something constructive—something that's bigger than ourselves.","popularity":0.5208,"poster_path":"/72cPQ9TBB6oNX0ihYZChvzod8lu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is anger the issue, or is the real problem what you get angry about?","title":"Nooma Store 016","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Bell","original_name":"Rob Bell","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/2bEjb4CviQPipQ7jK3BqShmFQTH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b000229251410b3a000434","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santino Stoner","original_name":"Santino Stoner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4sNUmSj6A4e0hrGErVD4LaJobG.jpg","credit_id":"56b000079251410b3a000431","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082377","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/72cPQ9TBB6oNX0ihYZChvzod8lu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2879,"name":"aggression"},{"id":14837,"name":"rage"},{"id":18047,"name":"anger"},{"id":157223,"name":"bitterness"},{"id":163119,"name":"injustice"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
