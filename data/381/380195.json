We may recall great moments from other sports, but rarely are they remembered as an integral part of our lives as is baseball. Ask a Pittsburgh fan where he was for Bill Mazeroski's home run. Mention Bucky Dent to a New Yorker - or Bill Buckner to a resident of Boston. Is there a Toronto fan alive who wasn't jumping just as high as Joe Carter in 1993? Baseball is passed down from one generation to another in a patient process that, in some ways, never ends. It's been this way for more than a century and will undoubtedly continue for generations to come. Contained herein, are the most memorable moments from baseball's first 125 years, each moment guaranteed to kindle a reminder of a special time - a special place. That's what baseball is all about.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":"/hpTiyHELJCZahLc5t63it8AtdKD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Official History of Baseball, Vol 1&2","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Fusselle","original_name":"Warner Fusselle","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64c7c5f3d6c30000e44966a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1945713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Scott","original_name":"Jeff Scott","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7c61fd7a70a0139dcb6ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4189808,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hal Fischer","original_name":"Hal Fischer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7c637cadb6b00ac66d112","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4189809,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Durand","original_name":"Mark Durand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7c64dd6c300011ee1c62d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Bodziner","original_name":"Robert Bodziner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7c675d7a70a00e2f738af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4169307,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steven Insler","original_name":"Steven Insler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7c695d7a70a00c525d01c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":1284,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hpTiyHELJCZahLc5t63it8AtdKD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":957},{"aspect_ratio":0.763,"height":1298,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sPjkzZbLRMcFfj0hKHgU0YQDjDp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":991}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
