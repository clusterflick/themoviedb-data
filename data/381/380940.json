And if you are looking for the outburst of the non-stop hilarity and the musical jokes of Rossini, you won't find it here. Also, while the Cendrillon was highly successful and popular in its time, it does not reach up to the artistic and musical levels offered by Massenet's other operas, like Manon, or Thais or Werther.  Nevertheless, this is a delightful opera and it is well presented by The Royal Opera. Laurent Pelly created a ingenious setting with movable walls which are covered [in French] with the story of Cinderella, and which open and close book-like.","popularity":0.2711,"poster_path":"/3NGlDPw4ayX2NoqqBTyO4l9aQc6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6771,"logo_path":"/e9G0oeZsr1j261DwvGJF6kzT0Gv.png","name":"Virgin Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cendrillon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1569474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Coote","original_name":"Alice Coote","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/mMRsZW3Opqb3zUxyKZa2D6bKZ9k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Le Prince Charmant","credit_id":"56b1f4a1925141264500233e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":276525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce DiDonato","original_name":"Joyce DiDonato","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":"/myd2U5QoH8dEx5TxTEZuA5cnMzw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cendrillon / Lucette","credit_id":"56b1f4b592514126cc002355","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eglise Gutiérrez","original_name":"Eglise Gutiérrez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"La Fée","credit_id":"56b1f4cac3a36862940019bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Philippe Lafont","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Lafont","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/cD2ZEPdR7IwqOFqhaHGFmppRb6k.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Pandolfe, Cendrillon’s father","credit_id":"56b1f4f692514126cc002361","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewa Podleś","original_name":"Ewa Podleś","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/iiSeh5W96PV1UFsWop23dOYZu2d.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Madame de la Haltière, stepmother of Cendrillon","credit_id":"56b1f511c3a3686221002e1b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Pierard","original_name":"Madeleine Pierard","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Noémie, stepsister of Cendrillon","credit_id":"56b1f52ec3a3686221002e22","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Rüütel","original_name":"Kai Rüütel","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/7wvW2yVReCpvp7SxdJK28BgnCsM.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dorothée, stepsister of Cendrillon","credit_id":"56b1f54b92514166d5001a99","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy White","original_name":"Jeremy White","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Le Roi","credit_id":"56b1f567c3a3686209002fd6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Nicoll","original_name":"Harry Nicoll","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Le Doyen de la Faculté","credit_id":"56b1f57e925141264500236a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawid Kimberg","original_name":"Dawid Kimberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Le Surintendant des plaisirs","credit_id":"56b1f5c5c3a3686209002fe9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John-Owen Miley-Read","original_name":"John-Owen Miley-Read","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Le Premier Ministre","credit_id":"56b1f5e2925141264500237e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrien Mastrosimone","original_name":"Adrien Mastrosimone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Le Héraut","credit_id":"56b1f63092514171f1001a79","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertrand de Billy","original_name":"Bertrand de Billy","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/chCShuWhFDOiBmN9ylurMMxVS6d.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Self -
