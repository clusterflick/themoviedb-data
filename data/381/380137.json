One story follows Yang's pilgrimage into the heart of the North Queensland sugar cane fields as he investigates the murder of his uncle Fang Yuen. The other is a series of moving portraits of the many friends and lovers Yang has lost to AIDS. Director Tony Ayres skillfully weaves these two separate stories together creating a powerful testament to family, friends, love and loss. Cinematography by Tristan Milani. Narrated by William Yang.","popularity":0.7051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1999-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sadness","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linden Goh","original_name":"Linden Goh","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/sJYRMOU0Vj1iR9mJrvhjooRtBOa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Red Hand","credit_id":"56f42278c3a3682fd5003240","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Yang","original_name":"William Yang","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56f4229e9251411a8b002f51","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tony Ayres","original_name":"Tony Ayres","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/AmnglQVIF4a42LmDLR3yvPD3ZCS.jpg","credit_id":"56ac8a42c3a3681c3f006104","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0220744","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":740,"name":"aids"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
