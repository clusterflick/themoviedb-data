As Sammy and Fanny watch a movie, an attractive exhibitionist sitting next to Sammy disrobes, placing her clothes on his lap. Jumping to conclusions, Fanny beats her husband. At work the next day, Sammy daydreams of beautiful girls who disrobe as he plays music on the mop, broom, and duster. Diving toward a waiting beauty, he collides with his wife, who has been napping as she keeps track of him. She again beats him. Sammy and Fanny then go to visit a doctor, but they stumble into a Nudist Colony Club office instead.","popularity":0.0944,"poster_path":"/ubVWZD1gE7m8Epp4BxGprJHSMlI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72709,"logo_path":null,"name":"G&S Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":15346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boxoffice International Pictures (BIP)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Stop the World...I Wanna Get On!","title":"The Wonderful World of Girls","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":549441,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank A.
