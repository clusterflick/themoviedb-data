The piece contrasts an orderly space of grids and numbers with a chaotic environment of found images cut from old films, news footage, and the Internet. Ordinary objects fly around an empty room, swirling abstractions dominate the walls, and distorted bodies dance over images of radio waves. Seemingly in motion, the space of Tornado Warning appears unruly, alarming, violent and relentless.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tornado Warning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Atlas","original_name":"Charles Atlas","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/dlYNDRuv0iInZxbFxvVTC7UUsbv.jpg","credit_id":"56acfedcc3a3681c3f0073d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
