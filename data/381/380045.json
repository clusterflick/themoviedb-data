Now, they have returned…AND THEY WILL CONSUME YOU!”  TRAILER TRAUMA is an unprecedented orgy of sex, violence, and insanity: over 2 hours of rare, ridiculous, horrific, and mind boggling movie previews, many of which are previously unreleased on DVD or VHS. Never before have cinema-goers seen such an onslaught of pulse-pounding excitement! Thrill to the action of BLACK FIST, IRON MASTER, and KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! Quiver in horror as you face the DAWN OF THE MUMMY, the REVENGE OF THE LIVING ZOMBIES, and the INCREDIBLE TORTURE SHOW! Scratch your head at the utter absurdity of DEATH BED, MUTANT WAR, and NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER! There are other movie preview compilation discs out there, but only TRAILER TRAUMA contains the ultra-rare titles that you absolutely will not find anywhere else. Prepare yourselves, connoisseurs of cult cinema: TRAILER TRAUMA is going to hurt...but it hurts so good!","popularity":0.2722,"poster_path":"/732cCTxookya1KcHFDgWIgKHPwc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garagehouse Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It will eat you alive.
