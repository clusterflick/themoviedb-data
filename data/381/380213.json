The band played crowd favorites off their two albums, The Head and the Heart and Let’s Be Still, opening with “Cats and Dogs” to roaring applause. Right from the opening notes of the first song, the audience was hooked, singing along with the band and with each other. The enthusiasm carried over into “Sounds Like Hallelujah,” “Shake,” and “Lost In My Mind,” while the whole crowd sang along to the heartfelt “Rivers and Roads”. As the evening concluded with “Down in the Valley,” the audience was embracing each other in arms, swaying back and forth. The nearly full moon shone bright on the crowd, and all was well at The Greek.
