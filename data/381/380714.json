Some are small things, and some of us have really big and devastating things. Some of us even have things that people close to us don't know about. Personal junk that we keep to ourselves so we don't have to deal with it. Because we don't know how to deal with it, do we? We're afraid that if we try it's just going to make everything worse. But no matter how big our junk is, no matter how much what we've done has impacted the way other people feel about us or how we feel about ourselves, it hasn't changed how God feels about us. God loves us, he always has and always will, and there's nothing we can do to change that.","popularity":0.3539,"poster_path":"/UqozMwWvpdpxZB3vTXmWBQ8vmq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do we do when our past catches up to us?","title":"Nooma Lump 010","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Bell","original_name":"Rob Bell","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/2bEjb4CviQPipQ7jK3BqShmFQTH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b00fad9251410b4600070d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santino Stoner","original_name":"Santino Stoner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4sNUmSj6A4e0hrGErVD4LaJobG.jpg","credit_id":"56b00f9b9251410b43000673","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082367","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/UqozMwWvpdpxZB3vTXmWBQ8vmq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3446,"name":"forgiveness"},{"id":33720,"name":"guilt"},{"id":188720,"name":"shame"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
