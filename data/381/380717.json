In fact, Jesus said that the most important thing in life is to love God with everything we've got and love others the same way. But it's not always easy to love everyone around us, is it? Sometimes we strongly disagree with other people's political views, religious beliefs, behaviors, or something else, and it makes it hard to love them when we feel like we're right and they're very wrong. But Jesus doesn't separate loving God and loving others. So maybe the best way for us to show our love for God is actually by loving other people no matter how hard it sometimes is. Maybe it's the only way.","popularity":0.5846,"poster_path":"/gfkiok2tMicrHPearKv9qqdKm2b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can we really love God without loving others?","title":"Nooma Bullhorn 009","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Bell","original_name":"Rob Bell","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/2bEjb4CviQPipQ7jK3BqShmFQTH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b015cac3a36864770006df","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santino Stoner","original_name":"Santino Stoner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4sNUmSj6A4e0hrGErVD4LaJobG.jpg","credit_id":"56b015de9251410b3a0007de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082361","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gfkiok2tMicrHPearKv9qqdKm2b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":11297,"name":"judgment"},{"id":164825,"name":"self righteousness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
