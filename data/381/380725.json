We spend our lives wondering what others think and say about us. Some of us even wish we were someone else. We question why we are the way we are and not the way we wish we could be. Some of us have let the expectations of others dictate who we've become. We act a certain way to be accepted but know that we're being untrue. But why are we so concerned with what other people think, say, or look like? What does it say about us if we are unable to accept who we are? Maybe if we really knew our true selves, we wouldn't give so much attention to other peoples' lives and live more in tune with the life God wants for us.","popularity":0.183,"poster_path":"/pnrRDvY7NNgWndALy1AGxOgV3pS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are we so concerned with what others think that we miss out on being who God created us to be?","title":"Nooma Name 018","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Bell","original_name":"Rob Bell","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/2bEjb4CviQPipQ7jK3BqShmFQTH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b02b649251415729000348","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santino Stoner","original_name":"Santino Stoner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4sNUmSj6A4e0hrGErVD4LaJobG.jpg","credit_id":"56b02b509251410b4b000bf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082369","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pnrRDvY7NNgWndALy1AGxOgV3pS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1284,"name":"identity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
