Believing that we can actually be the kind of people we were meant to be. People of love, compassion, peace, forgiveness, and hope. People who try to do the right thing all of the time. Who act on the endless opportunities around us every day for good, beauty, and truth. It's easy for us to sometimes get down on ourselves. To feel \"not good enough\" or feel like we don't have what it takes. But maybe if we had more insight into the culture that Jesus grew up in and some of the radical things he did, we'd understand the faith that God has in all of us.","popularity":0.4072,"poster_path":"/j6yfp7RkuFK2pHFNlmksQTeqcl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storefront Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What does God see in us?","title":"Nooma Dust 008","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Bell","original_name":"Rob Bell","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/2bEjb4CviQPipQ7jK3BqShmFQTH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"56aff7a8c3a3686472000236","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santino Stoner","original_name":"Santino Stoner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4sNUmSj6A4e0hrGErVD4LaJobG.jpg","credit_id":"56aff7c3c3a368647a00022a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082363","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6yfp7RkuFK2pHFNlmksQTeqcl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11296,"name":"choice"},{"id":15320,"name":"insecurity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
