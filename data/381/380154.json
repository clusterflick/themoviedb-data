If they fail they are beheaded. Turandot does this in memory of a female ancestor who was brutally ravished and murdered by a marauding prince. Many have failed her test, the latest being the Prince of Persia who will be executed at moonrise. Watching is Calaf, son of the King of Tartary, who on seeing Turandot is captivated by her beauty and he takes up the challenge. With Rosario La Spina cast as Calaf, Susan Foster as the icy princess and Hyeseoung Kwon as the loyal slave girl Liù, the singing throughout is superlative. The choreography and direction of Graeme Murphy is visionary, add the set and costume designs of Kristian Fredrikson, and the lighting of John Drummond Montgomery and this production is glorious in its beauty.","popularity":0.3444,"poster_path":"/c9FTwgMIpe70UTFUDbz69QS4DEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turandot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Giacomo Puccini: Turandot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Foster","original_name":"Susan Foster","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Princess Turandot","credit_id":"56acaaaac3a3681c54005d92","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jud Arthur","original_name":"Jud Arthur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Timur","credit_id":"56aca99b9251417c98001d80","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosario La Spina","original_name":"Rosario La Spina","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Calaf","credit_id":"56aca9ae9251417e20005d44","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hyeseoung Kwon","original_name":"Hyeseoung Kwon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Liù","credit_id":"56acaa36c3a3681c31005c07","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Moran","original_name":"Andrew Moran","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ping","credit_id":"56aca9c9c3a3681c47005fa7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Corcoran","original_name":"David Corcoran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pong","credit_id":"56aca9e79251417e290059b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graeme Macfarlane","original_name":"Graeme Macfarlane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pang","credit_id":"56aca9fdc3a3681c3b005eeb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Tea Kim","original_name":"Jin Tea Kim","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Prince of Persia","credit_id":"56acaa1c9251410e8f0057c4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Rasheed","original_name":"Benjamin Rasheed","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Altoum","credit_id":"56acaa5bc3a3681c31005c0e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane Lowrencev","original_name":"Shane Lowrencev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"A Mandarin","credit_id":"56ba50579251417193000763","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Cunningham","original_name":"Rachael Cunningham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Handmaiden","credit_id":"56ba5087925141718100077e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Wiles","original_name":"Katherine Wiles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Handmaiden","credit_id":"56ba509f92514171860007de","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cameron Kirkpatrick","original_name":"Cameron Kirkpatrick","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56aca8fac3a3681c31005be1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3791850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9FTwgMIpe70UTFUDbz69QS4DEF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ap0G2DbDmeiwGbhdpm7XNswR2cn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":222420,"name":"giacomo puccini"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
