I underwent more treatments and operations than the unluckiest of Marvel heroes. But I am a normal teenager without any super powers.

I intend to my mark before bowing out.”","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/aa7dFjrZfkVPnroLJljTxGjfYEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zacharie Chasseriaud","original_name":"Zacharie Chasseriaud","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/ykP9pxneYXDmDHSz0vIl9Xq3bDs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"56abbddec3a3681c3400307a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Masiero","original_name":"Corinne Masiero","popularity":0.4204,"profile_path":"/6MojaeeGYKii8M957thIxvC8Gz9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Laurence","credit_id":"56abbdf09251417e14003578","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustave Kervern","original_name":"Gustave Kervern","popularity":0.3857,"profile_path":"/kDBq8wmIxXl7NgiC3ilR0qCwrgX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marc","credit_id":"57696be992514153b2002529","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emmanuel Caussé","original_name":"Emmanuel Caussé","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56abbd9d9251413e95002de3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Martin","original_name":"Eric Martin","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56abbdd3c3a3681c37002fc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20681,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Muriel Merlin","original_name":"Muriel Merlin","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663de3d0cf1b151d997f0425","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347964,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Benjamin Louet","original_name":"Benjamin Louet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663de3e47601152fab0f76cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2401362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémi Bouvier","original_name":"Rémi Bouvier","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663de41086e5454682026815","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646888,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cédric Ettouati","original_name":"Cédric Ettouati","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663de454aca065f3e5cd9683","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3769234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aa7dFjrZfkVPnroLJljTxGjfYEF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Roche-sur-Yon International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
