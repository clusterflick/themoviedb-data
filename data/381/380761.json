They headed back to the safety of the far side River Marne south of Paris rather than to the traditional haven of British Armies – the Channel Ports.The BHTV team of historians and battlefield guides take us to the scene of some sharp rear guard actions fought during the Retreat from Mons including the great cavalry actions at Cerizy and Nery, where the mounted British soldier established domination of his German counterpart. As they travel the highways and byways of France they analyze the decisions made by the commanders in that fog of war that together spelt the end of the Schlieffen Plan and set conditions for the 'miracle of the Marne'.","popularity":0.185,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Néry and the Retreat from Mons","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Oldfield","original_name":"Paul Oldfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b075269251410b3a001b54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Church","original_name":"Ed Church","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b07540c3a368647700192d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Peters","original_name":"Mike Peters","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b075569251410b37001c6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0756bc3a3686485001c38","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0758192514157290012c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b075a09251410b4b001b18","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
