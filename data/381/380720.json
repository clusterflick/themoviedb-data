Yet, for thousands of years, people have understood that our physical breath is a picture of a deeper spiritual reality. In the Bible, the word for \"breath\" is the same as the word for \"spirit.\" There's an inherent dilemma at the core of what makes us human. We've all been created in the image of God and possess immense power and strength. And at the same time, our lives are incredibly vulnerable and fragile. Maybe if we had more insight into the meaning of breathing, we would better understand how God created us as human beings.","popularity":0.4457,"poster_path":"/vYOlzSGCVOV6dRHxiRQBuRk56PB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is our physical breath actually a picture of a deeper spiritual reality?","title":"Nooma Breathe 014","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Bell","original_name":"Rob Bell","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/2bEjb4CviQPipQ7jK3BqShmFQTH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56b01d939251410b37000940","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santino Stoner","original_name":"Santino Stoner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4sNUmSj6A4e0hrGErVD4LaJobG.jpg","credit_id":"56b01db19251410b43000872","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2082360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vYOlzSGCVOV6dRHxiRQBuRk56PB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9649,"name":"god"},{"id":13153,"name":"spirit"},{"id":207947,"name":"sacred"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
