For the French in particular fortresses and fortified towns were the only places they could guarantee the safety of their logistics from the Spanish and Portuguese guerillas. If Wellington was going to liberate Portugal and Spain he would have to overcome these fortified locations. This film looks at the British and French experience during this period and uses the the great sieges of Ciudad Rodtigo and Badajoz to illustrate how both defence and attacks were carried out . The BHTV team use footage from Spain, re enactments, maps and models to bring this much neglected aspect of the Peninsula  war to life.","popularity":0.5187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siege Warfare 1812: Ciudad Rodrigo & Badajoz - The Keys to Spain","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0edd79251412ec2000561","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b0ede99251412ec50005d4","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4063,"name":"siege"},{"id":200565,"name":"wellington"},{"id":221546,"name":"peninsular war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
