The death of 42 people including women and children was the biggest single blow Iceland suffered in WW2. The Lost Ship tells the story of the people on board the ship on this fateful voyage as the war was coming to an end. It also tells the story of the crew of the German submarine U-300 that came from Norway. Godafoss was sunk close to shore but the ship has never been found although the search has been on for 65 years.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/1ZQa3rnHVLEuJmFNZLW4rYozuZJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Björn Brynjúlfur Björnsson","original_name":"Björn Brynjúlfur Björnsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c6b4c3a368621b002865","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jón Ársæll Þórðarson","original_name":"Jón Ársæll Þórðarson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c663c3a3686221002747","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Björn Brynjúlfur Björnsson","original_name":"Björn Brynjúlfur Björnsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c6d8925141268a001bd9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jón Ársæll Þórðarson","original_name":"Jón Ársæll Þórðarson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c6e29251411d67001cbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Björn Brynjúlfur Björnsson","original_name":"Björn Brynjúlfur Björnsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c64d92514126ba001cb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guðmundur Bjartmarsson","original_name":"Guðmundur Bjartmarsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c69492514166d50013a7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571976,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Þór Whitehead","original_name":"Þór Whitehead","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b1c6719251411d67001cad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571978,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tryggvi M.
