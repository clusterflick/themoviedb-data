Politics in general is a cynical enterprise but nowadays when we have a deeply polarized society, when the majority on both sides believes that the government is taking the country in the wrong direction, hearing the repetitive messaging of the superiority of US democracy and values is pretty pathetic.  “The Other America” and many countries of what is called “The Global South” see a different road that would benefit the United States, and the rest of the world through a win-win strategy based on mutual respect of interests of all rather than the hegemony of one.
