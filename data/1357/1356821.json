Sometimes with a light pat on the cheek, sometimes with razor-sharp satire. In 2024, Magnus Betnér turns 50 and now the roles are reversed. Together with some of his \"best\" friends in the industry, you are welcomed to Varberg's theater for an evening where Magnus Betnér is the one who gets to receive both verbal caresses and punches in MAGNUS BETNÉRS FIFTY-YEAR ROAST!  To give back, Magnus has invited some of the sharpest (and meanest) humor pens in Sweden. Well-known comedians mixed with faces more unknown to the audience, all with one thing in common: they know Magnus better than almost anyone else. Corpses must be dug up, weaknesses must be exposed and the fine qualities that Magnus possesses must be highlighted. To a minimum.","popularity":0.1565,"poster_path":"/nGO0oXFWki0qzxAc5N5kGI7chO2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let the heckles begin","title":"Magnus Betner 50års ROAST","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Betnér","original_name":"Magnus Betnér","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/bByGNeU4gRiza0XmE05KVEJrQxh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67e62050f14e4fccf591a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3069866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Nyblom","original_name":"Henrik Nyblom","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/8xXXLwolYAiyubHla3hwTig7Pwl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67e7ae8211ecd22b0652a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2394095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petrina Solange","original_name":"Petrina Solange","popularity":0.1911,"profile_path":"/4jUdHWZT4GpUOYuxdl8f6jDVibm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67e8ddd224d1a39913119","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3039619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsty Armstrong","original_name":"Kirsty Armstrong","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67ea7d7bcca524db066ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2292588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nisse Hallberg","original_name":"Nisse Hallberg","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/5WZZkFgN1mHlKUyZ80lSqgQahNS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67eb7d7bcca524db066b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1622581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Knyckare","original_name":"Emma Knyckare","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/ylUwGF5TtbY9fJBHY2kK88vKxwf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67ec6050f14e4fccf593e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1736335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Wagrell","original_name":"Johanna Wagrell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/4FFjEIW44W7hGlmHTuQDAlW6LOt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67ed4d7bcca524db066c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Källman","original_name":"Henrik Källman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67ee89dfbbdf0e6cf56e9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Mattisson","original_name":"Henrik Mattisson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e67ef49dfbbdf0e6cf56f8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Betnér","original_name":"Lina Betnér","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f644c96c3583c97599ba27","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Betnér","original_name":"Magnus Betnér","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/bByGNeU4gRiza0XmE05KVEJrQxh.jpg","credit_id":"66e68474e8211ecd22b06673","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3039619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsty Armstrong","original_name":"Kirsty Armstrong","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e68483050f14e4fccf5ae7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3039619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsty Armstrong","original_name":"Kirsty Armstrong","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e684a33768a73f8d913810","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d5TUrZIf3XwB3fIx1fKENSAYoWD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1224,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGO0oXFWki0qzxAc5N5kGI7chO2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":816}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
