However, rising oil prices led to the reactivation of the project in 2013. The film documents the struggle of the Yasunidos group to call for a referendum to reverse the exploitation. The documentary, through archival material and current recordings, follows the effort and the legal battle against corporate interests throughout three governments, left and right. The documentary is part of a diptych with Toroboro: the name of the plants.","popularity":0.1657,"poster_path":"/yBDAURM8Fbj4Q1a4EdUDFo2i5OM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77237,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Maquinita","origin_country":"EC"},{"id":37100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avoa Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2024-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toroboro: La Consulta Popular","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manolo Sarmiento","original_name":"Manolo Sarmiento","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/fF8J3IEPPoSlZd6DL9u1svzNA5Y.jpg","credit_id":"66e7940d050f14e4fccfc6d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Manoela Ziggiatti","original_name":"Manoela Ziggiatti","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/psieCYzkaSlx6lHHSMSiR1hY7G3.jpg","credit_id":"66e79b709dfbbdf0e6cfcfcb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432505,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Andrade","original_name":"Daniel Andrade","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/3mAbqnMyMVMWOZtYHNxXTBG1P2n.jpg","credit_id":"66e79b8a050f14e4fccfc917","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624016,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","original_name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e79bdbd7bcca524db0e22a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":863,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yBDAURM8Fbj4Q1a4EdUDFo2i5OM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186504,"name":"referendum"},{"id":201386,"name":"drilling for oil"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"EDOC Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
