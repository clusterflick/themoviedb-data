As the symptoms crept in slowly, Levitt realized she had to do something to cope—to create a dialogue and to shed the stigma. She began filming. The resulting documentary depicts her family living with this disease and the ways in which it has irrevocably changed their lives without letting it define them. Levitt’s highly intimate approach captures how they cherish both the solid foundation they have built together and the generous community who walks with them.","popularity":0.2443,"poster_path":"/tkp4VSHoW1g8dyoMSO0leyK8yOB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2740,"logo_path":"/gSiDWkmEOyOn9MsaCgnjd8Mohmx.png","name":"Jigsaw Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walk with Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2324,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heidi Levitt","original_name":"Heidi Levitt","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/pdssZWtmN07CUyq55qFxxNupap4.jpg","credit_id":"66e3fd70c81b24b3fe23f8e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gibney","original_name":"Alex Gibney","popularity":0.4984,"profile_path":"/kJp2tfLlg0smYgnhA8Fw5LBbRwC.jpg","credit_id":"670ac15e37d86d520bb09373","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33398087","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tkp4VSHoW1g8dyoMSO0leyK8yOB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":864}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
