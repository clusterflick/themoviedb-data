Determined to make a film about his newfound “object of beauty,” he begins invading every aspect of Krista’s life. As his infatuation escalates from inappropriate to criminal, we are left questioning who is really watching whom.  Director Tim Kasher’s WHO’S WATCHING? is a masterwork of discomfort that will get under your skin—and stay there. With an unforgettable central performance from Zachary Ray Sherman as Caleb and yet another standout turn from Olivia Luccardi, WHO’S WATCHING? is disturbing, transgressive cinema at its most provocative—a film that pushes every boundary and then some.","popularity":0.5576,"poster_path":"/d8ibpjQeZR0dgqXeMs1c7IbapAW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239156,"logo_path":null,"name":"15 Passenger Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who's Watching","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":519735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gracie Gillam","original_name":"Gracie Gillam","popularity":0.5672,"profile_path":"/3iQ6g0OdUkHXRE0mZVKuwCK8WuP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Krista","credit_id":"66e3e07fc81b24b3fe23ebc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Ray Sherman","original_name":"Zachary Ray Sherman","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":"/x7e3V8YA4IHtYEgxgPH2kBUENVJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Caleb","credit_id":"66e3e08a0000000000b978cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Luccardi","original_name":"Olivia Luccardi","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/ziFOKDl9PPPteadAPkcyR3etcjq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tawnia","credit_id":"66e78d22e8211ecd22b0cde2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Kasher","original_name":"Tim Kasher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/b1qvb6qFpz57cs8Xc4tl44pjC86.jpg","credit_id":"66e3e03ff467c2ad62f95753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194701,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josh Ethier","original_name":"Josh Ethier","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/8DROpoQtncbjneiMdvse47uoK8l.jpg","credit_id":"66e3e061f467c2ad62f95765","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Kasher","original_name":"Tim Kasher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/b1qvb6qFpz57cs8Xc4tl44pjC86.jpg","credit_id":"66e78d44e8211ecd22b0cde7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4939841,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maher Jafari","original_name":"Maher Jafari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e78d68e8211ecd22b0cded","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Kasher","original_name":"Tim Kasher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/b1qvb6qFpz57cs8Xc4tl44pjC86.jpg","credit_id":"66e78dd0dd224d1a3991a38d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4939842,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liz Renner","original_name":"Liz Renner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e78ddb9dfbbdf0e6cfcc78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Kasher","original_name":"Tim Kasher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/b1qvb6qFpz57cs8Xc4tl44pjC86.jpg","credit_id":"66e78df1e8211ecd22b0cdf9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609056,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian Sowell","original_name":"Brian Sowell","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/qz5jkEdjnGuxVUk9LFed0DfQpEz.jpg","credit_id":"66e78e07050f14e4fccfc5ae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4944770,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hilary Staff","original_name":"Hilary Staff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e78e3bd7bcca524db0de1f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33372484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WKX4hcgfjq9lsWFLWewF0HqYHH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d8ibpjQeZR0dgqXeMs1c7IbapAW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1417},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bkdK45MyiHOb4xJvlG5zR2ukvtx.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beyond Fest","release_date":"2024-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
