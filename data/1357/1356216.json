This travelogue was produced by the Travel and Industrial Development Association, projecting an image of olde worlde charm to audiences abroad. The fact that this version is silent suggests that it was made for non-theatrical screening.” - BFI Player.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/4aZQAbpGm9hbNwoxJwbFitf51ah.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238962,"logo_path":null,"name":"TIDA","origin_country":""},{"id":15557,"logo_path":null,"name":"GPO Film Unit","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1939-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chiltern Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cavalcanti","original_name":"Alberto Cavalcanti","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/wb9sB74uuEkc5mo5hALCzAG7HgT.jpg","credit_id":"66e46c7628048d92def98f7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1529,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4aZQAbpGm9hbNwoxJwbFitf51ah.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1143}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
