It is a place known only for one peculiar attribute: a string of mysterious disappearances stretching back to the turn of the century. Locals believe that the legendary ghost of a woman named Mary Bregavy may be haunting the town, looking for suitors to meet her in the realm beyond. A local innkeeper seems to have all the answers, but is his account of Mary true, or just more local folklore? A burnt-out tabloid writer goes in search of the legend and ends up becoming a key player in a story he could only dream of inventing.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resurrection Mary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilford Brimley","original_name":"Wilford Brimley","popularity":1.1669,"profile_path":"/pOfcXSGKiHcdFIcnhBV3ibGUruW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Morty","credit_id":"66e49d37c81b24b3fe244342","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4940888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Connor","original_name":"Justin Connor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bobbie Renfro","credit_id":"66e49d57c81b24b3fe24435d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4888738,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Nagle","original_name":"Patrick Nagle","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Spook Murrow","credit_id":"66e49d7f28048d92def9a2b5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Arnold","original_name":"Matthew Arnold","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/aPZ2WhH8Yd6atz2ztqvH6MCgMzj.jpg","credit_id":"66e49d8ff467c2ad62f9ad55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0337704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
