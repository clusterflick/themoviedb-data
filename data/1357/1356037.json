But who were these fated ancient Romans? To find out, forensic scientists will take CT scans and digital X-rays to reveal who these people were and how they lived before the eruption 1,700 years ago. Meanwhile, a team of architects and archaeologists will conduct traditional digs and use modern 3D mapping to reveal new evidence and dispel old myths about this doomed city.","popularity":0.0666,"poster_path":"/u2BnTKQS08m4qFJVuaPlNSyoT64.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86233,"logo_path":"/w3TUWUJOVoxR4j9dcgI4C1YY9W0.png","name":"Lion Television USA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":137140,"logo_path":"/24Gu0QzuDp6umZ3qgnwAru6KiiC.png","name":"The Smithsonian Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pompeii: The Dead Speak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4114529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Kamer","original_name":"Steven Kamer","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66e3c3270000000000b970f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian A.
