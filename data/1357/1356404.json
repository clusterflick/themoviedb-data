It is a contemporary version whose diegesis has been slightly disrupted. Indeed, without touching the original text, the editing and arrangement of the shots illustrate in parallel with scene 3 a different interaction between the characters, which will disrupt the course of the story.  To give meaning and interest to my adaptation, I decided to play with the ambiguities left hanging by the author and taken up in the film adaptation of the play with \"Charlton Eston\". Corneille chooses to establish a relationship of fascination between Elvire and Chimène. I chose to go a little further by pushing the latter's feelings towards those of love. Starting from this postulate, Chimène will decide out of passion to assassinate Don Rodrigue, the man who makes the woman she loves suffer so much.","popularity":0.1077,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cid Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noémie Merlant","original_name":"Noémie Merlant","popularity":1.324,"profile_path":"/lg83RO8HugXg9zbGtLtlsZSKjgA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chimène","credit_id":"66e512e9f3d3f8bff96d65d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1395703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Jurczak","original_name":"Carolina Jurczak","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/3IGOvdhw8EDZ3G855Qwn7KAfILF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elvire","credit_id":"66e512fc96e93efb9d2e1feb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Ducreux","original_name":"Guillaume Ducreux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/569mzlO69lyo1TRfJctwgOFFyzS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rodrigue","credit_id":"66e51318f3d3f8bff96d65e4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4941445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Warren Sebag","original_name":"Roman Warren Sebag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e5133ffb3914e255fd4699","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://romanwarrensebag-blog.tumblr.com/","release_date":"2012-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
