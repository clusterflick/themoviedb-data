The film investigates how nefarious elements of rhetoric and conspiracy are seeded though paranoia and prejudice, the impact of misinformation, and the cultivation of far-right extremism – culminating in Ireland in the Dublin riots (November 2023) and in continuing violent anti-immigrant protests. Featuring interviews with current and former US presidential advisors, presidential candidates, a CIA Director and an evangelical propagandist and Irish politicians, historians and political commentators.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gXjmJz3XEdDGZ9Lbte8Ca7AMf7W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amplified: The Exportation of the Culture Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4939988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Sheridan","original_name":"Mike Sheridan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e40d8c28048d92def968c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gXjmJz3XEdDGZ9Lbte8Ca7AMf7W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
