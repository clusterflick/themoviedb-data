The film alternates between musical performances and personal stories. Hanne Rasmussen, formerly called Hans, faces stigma and still has to dress in men's clothes when he sees his family. With old letters and archive clips, Ellen Bækgaard talks about historical figures such as Lili Elbe and Magnus Hirchsfeld. American Christine Jørgensen shares the story of her life and the attention she received when she went to Denmark in the 1950s to have sex reassignment surgery. And Thomas Holck, who was formerly called Lis, talks about his innermost thoughts and the 15 years it took to achieve stability in his new gender.","popularity":0.1703,"poster_path":"/dnMvYuiRUYBUUzdlSpqQbGC0val.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239120,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Norwegian Film Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1985-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise is Not for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanne Rasmussen","original_name":"Hanne Rasmussen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66e6cad8050f14e4fccf7711","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Bækgaard","original_name":"Ellen Bækgaard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66e6caea050f14e4fccf7720","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Jorgensen","original_name":"Christine Jorgensen","popularity":0.1218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66e6caf8dd224d1a3991505f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Holck","original_name":"Thomas Holck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66e6cb0f9dfbbdf0e6cf7221","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teit Ritzau","original_name":"Teit Ritzau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e6cac2dd224d1a39915039","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dnMvYuiRUYBUUzdlSpqQbGC0val.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"1985-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
