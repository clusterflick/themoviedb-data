Travel time, comfort in transport, its cost, its frequency, walking, all elements that harm the quality of life of employees and considerably limit their free time: this is because working conditions are almost as important as the work itself. The film includes beautiful shots of urban traffic (buses, suburban trains, cars), or pedestrians, and crowds walking, either in the street, in the metro, or leaving factories.
