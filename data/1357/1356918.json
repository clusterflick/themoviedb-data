The film explores the role that creativity and art  plays in people’s lives, particularly when personal trauma occurs or when people are afflicted by natural disasters.  The inspiration for the film came about by contemplating the questions; ‘Why is art such an important aspect to civilisation and our society’? and ‘Does the human brain benefit from interacting with art, and if so, how’?  From these questions a number of people offered their experience and research, especially in describing brain plasticity and the ability of the brain to rewire after an artistic experience.","popularity":0.0618,"poster_path":"/4TSAn0f6Dm1TPKwo40wxrIxNfnD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medea
