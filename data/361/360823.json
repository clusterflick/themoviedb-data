She finds her answer and her healing when she fuels herself with purpose by becoming a chiropractor with a passion for unconditional love and international service. 11 years later we join her on a 5-day chiropractic service trip to The Sacred Valley, Peru with her new boyfriend Austin and her friend Alejandra.  They are on a mission to serve as many people as possible offering healing, hope, and connection through collaboration with a medical clinic. Watch as the three stretch themselves by surrendering to service, affecting thousands that they touch, and ultimately, transforming as individuals through the power of love and teamwork. Love Bomb is interwoven with expert voices that explore themes of human transformation, love, altruism, and consciousness.","popularity":0.5117,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey From Fear To Love","title":"Love Bomb","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Peter Amlinger","original_name":"Dr. Peter Amlinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"560034679251414e5900001d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kute Blackson","original_name":"Kute Blackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5600348bc3a3685f3f00002e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Bernstein","original_name":"Gabrielle Bernstein","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"560034989251414e59000023","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Brower","original_name":"Elena Brower","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/49056dLEcTf25BEjCd1VYZHuTPV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"560034adc3a3685f54000039","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Chilton Pearce","original_name":"Joseph Chilton Pearce","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"560034bd9251414e50000026","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra DelPrado","original_name":"Sandra DelPrado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"560034cfc3a3685f51000030","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido DelPrado","original_name":"Guido DelPrado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"560034da9251414e56000037","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513055,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gregg Marks","original_name":"Gregg Marks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56003707c3a3685f4500005f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513055,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gregg Marks","original_name":"Gregg Marks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56003714c3a3685f3700007a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dr. Rhea Zimmerman","original_name":"Dr. Rhea Zimmerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56003733c3a3685f5100007f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dr. Rhea Zimmerman","original_name":"Dr. Rhea Zimmerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"560037409251414e53000071","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":167696,"name":"healing"},{"id":219900,"name":"chiropractor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Love Bomb The Movie - Trailer One","key":"ageDeC0pKgY","published_at":"2013-05-10T03:37:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"560034409251414e56000021"}]}}}
