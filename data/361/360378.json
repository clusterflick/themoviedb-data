Kennedy remains a towering figure in  American life and politics. From his inaugural speeches and his meeting with the Soviet premier  Nikita Khrushchev to the Cuban missile crisis and the standoff over integration at the University  of Mississippi, he presided over a nation committed to democratic leadership but threatened by  external forces and unresolved divisions at home. JFK: A Presidency Revealed shows that like  the nation he served, he was a flawed giant. This special presentation traces key events in his life  and career. Family members, associates, and historians offer personal and compelling glimpses  into the life of this influential President.","popularity":0.2038,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JFK: A Presidency Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
