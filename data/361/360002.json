In a blend of land art performance and road movie, artist duo Bigert &amp; Bergström travel to the US tornado belt with their special machine-sculpture, the Tornado Diverter. The goal: To stop a tornado. Along the way, we see historical examples of how the science of meteorology developed in symbiosis with military goals and how these visions evolved into modern ideas of geo-engineering. Controversial ideas with socio-political consequences, spotlighting the big question of who is really entitled to modified weather.","popularity":0.4759,"poster_path":"/1NyW92EvREi1Nlsjntu15oTrOu4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weather War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Väderkriget","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Bergström","original_name":"Lars Bergström","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f7f177c3a3686d0300cfc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mats Bigert","original_name":"Mats Bigert","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kP48675OVf3B3zgnODxBCe5CR0p.jpg","credit_id":"55f7f189c3a3686d0700d6f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4143916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1278,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1NyW92EvREi1Nlsjntu15oTrOu4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3823,"name":"weather manipulation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
