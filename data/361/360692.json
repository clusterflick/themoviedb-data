Ed is suddenly drafted into the army and is to be sent  overseas to battle while Daisy is sent to her father in Auckland.  When Ed's leave is cancelled at the last minute he takes the  dangerous decision to go absent without leave to be with Daisy on  her journey home. As a deserter, Ed is hunted, captured and  imprisoned. Life inside is bad enought without the worry of what  is going on outside. The film is based upon a true story.","popularity":0.915,"poster_path":"/nYYsmFZcxceXV6HnwEXLNtTvPwC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":294,"logo_path":"/a05DY2oSeUOVFDM61RsQa9x9RoC.png","name":"New
