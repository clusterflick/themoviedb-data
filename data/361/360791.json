One morning on the way to set, Evan and his fellow \"Background Actors\" are left behind. Unwittingly picked up by Terrorists, they are taken over the border to Mexico. Even after being stripped, hosed down, and stuck in a cold warehouse, not one of them can tell the difference between this and a normal day on a Hollywood set. Will they escape? Does anyone care? After experiencing this absurd circus Evan calls his career, he only knows one thing for sure: Hell IS other extras.","popularity":0.1085,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Background(ed)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Walz","original_name":"Tom Walz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Evan Higginbotham","credit_id":"55ffddff92514118240023ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominick Marrone","original_name":"Dominick Marrone","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dave","credit_id":"55ffde0fc3a3681a400025e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Elverman","original_name":"Bill Elverman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aryan","credit_id":"55ffde229251414ca90001b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1512765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecelia Specht","original_name":"Cecelia Specht","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/j69GLzPNFtJOLngakXESG5iZz78.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kate from Modern Casting","credit_id":"55ffde33c3a368176200242d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Jackson","original_name":"Matt Jackson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ffde439251412aad00203b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benj Goehner","original_name":"Benj Goehner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ffde54c3a368133b004cb2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1186637","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Background(ed) trailer","key":"Wx2vEehQa54","published_at":"2007-10-12T05:55:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"55ffdea99251412aad002045"}]}}}
