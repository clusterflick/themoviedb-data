The birth of Tyrol was one of collisions, where previous far apart continents were conjoined, wedged together and piled up on top of each other. The result is a steep world of diversity on the smallest area: depending on the depth of a valley or the height of a mountain ridge, depending on its direction and position at the edge or in the middle of the Alps, depending on whether its slope is steep or flat, there is a spot in Tyrol that is icy or mild, lush or paltry, dry or full of water. This film presents the fascinating world of the high mountains with all their diverse flora and fauna and the living conditions throught the seasons.","popularity":0.1126,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic of the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hollingdale","original_name":"Paul Hollingdale","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (narrator)","credit_id":"60ac3fd9297338007981b226","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otmar Penker","original_name":"Otmar Penker","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/zmkiw7qnoBS5DEtQS15GGpeBhYL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (presenter)","credit_id":"60ac3fe15e1200003fcde796","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Feichtenberger","original_name":"Klaus Feichtenberger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ac3f9850733c002a8d11d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otmar Penker","original_name":"Otmar Penker","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/zmkiw7qnoBS5DEtQS15GGpeBhYL.jpg","credit_id":"60ac3f8e07e281006ddbeb7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11858736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
