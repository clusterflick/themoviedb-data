One of the dads is their manager; we hear from him and one of the moms at whose house they rehearse. The lads talk about their playing, singing, and song writing. The gig is a success and all the CDs sell.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/drtdqYS1C1ljjeuxP2JrR1nDWj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Metal Jr.","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0477010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/drtdqYS1C1ljjeuxP2JrR1nDWj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
