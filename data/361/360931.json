In the first two reels, which have been lost, a woman caught in an abusive marriage runs away with her infant son from her drunken husband. He falls on a knife and dies and she collapses in the bush. The child wanders off and is found by one family; the mother is rescued by another family and is unaware that her son lives.","popularity":0.1157,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southern Cross Feature Film Company","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1918-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman Suffers","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"The Woman Suffers While the Man Goes Free","type":"Full on-screen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1513282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lottie Lyell","original_name":"Lottie Lyell","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/75E20hkAeWMw2MmUhGjjo1ngltw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Daughter","credit_id":"5600fe32c3a3685614000f45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boyd Irwin","original_name":"Boyd Irwin","popularity":0.1761,"profile_path":"/bpLCRZqEayIzt12McaOKao2f6AH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e2d3435811d001750951d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Conway","original_name":"Roland Conway","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e2d3a283ed900155da2f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connie Martyn","original_name":"Connie Martyn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e2d409b8616001869feaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Baxter","original_name":"Paul Baxter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e2d469a3c490012364c72","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482705,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arthur Higgins","original_name":"Arthur Higgins","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650bf83e4da3d4012cc08921","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Longford","original_name":"Raymond Longford","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aVdwiEuwLDfS1bFIzTEmWraY0IG.jpg","credit_id":"5600fe19925141228a000ed7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Longford","original_name":"Raymond Longford","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aVdwiEuwLDfS1bFIzTEmWraY0IG.jpg","credit_id":"5e4e2d2b35811d001750950f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009829","wikidata_id":"Q15039609","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
