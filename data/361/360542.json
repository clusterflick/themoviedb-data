He sternly comments on Sam's work, such as napping while milking, or spilling a little milk, causing Sam to tell his mother how hard it is to please his father. She explains that Tav is just teaching him traits he will need as a man, and although his father loves him very much he finds it hard to express this in words. Sam admits to having the same problem. She says that there are unspoken ways to communicate love, and Sam volunteers, \"Like Christmas presents ?\" She agrees, but will not tell him how to select a special gift for his father. On Christmas morning Sam goes out to the barn alone (except for the cows, pigs, and chickens) to deliver his special gift in a setting very similar to where the very first Christmas gifts were bestowed.","popularity":0.6286,"poster_path":"/nO4XqRqWrSVu4ZjRDSrwK88qbhL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brigham Young University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why is my Father is so hard on me?","title":"The Gift","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Griffith","original_name":"James Griffith","popularity":0.3459,"profile_path":"/7ES9uMQei0uAY7pTTXBAD7xLzx0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tav","credit_id":"55fd937792514152b400110d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis L.
