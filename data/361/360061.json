His professional peers speak of Frutiger as a living legend. To the general public however he remains unknown, even though every day they may come face to face with his work in one form or another, as lettering for texts, logos and corporate images for the post office, museums and institutions of all kinds, airports and metropolitan railways. Frutiger has never sought fame, only to design typefaces that are efficient and easy on the eye. In designing typefaces he does not attempt to be trendy.
