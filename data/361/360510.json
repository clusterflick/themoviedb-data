Not only that his Serbo-Croatian patient Masha has reported him for sexual assault. Magnus is also struggling with blackmail: a stranger has stolen his diaries, which reveal his innermost desires and abysses. The well-known psychotherapist is an obsessional neurotic who can only with difficulty hide his disgust from his fellow man.

But he has to rethink in order to solve his problems.","popularity":0.4645,"poster_path":"/p9eWFbj7vmbDsJIqMZWECj5rGI5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63666,"logo_path":"/2knFxadytGjfqalQsLZtWM37SLC.png","name":"Nordfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der
