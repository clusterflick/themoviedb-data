It stuck in my mind. Now that I think about it, Brakhage may have meant this as a joke. He said, “Someday Hollywood will probably make a film about us,”  ‘us’ meaning the experimental filmmakers  “and I wonder which actors will play us?” Think about that first of all: the idea that Hollywood would make a film about experimental filmmakers is totally ridiculous. The fact that one would think about which actor was going to play me at some time in the future, I think that’s very funny. Eventually it germinated in my mind and I thought it was an interesting idea… A film about experimental filmmakers, especially in the very formative period, approximately 1968 to 1972.","popularity":0.0506,"poster_path":"/nZD9u4ZMk40RRhyPBM8B77aT6DB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excerpts from a Work in Progress (Undesirables)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Land","original_name":"Owen Land","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/liamsqKEYvHLZFnHGTgvMdUoJbo.jpg","credit_id":"55f8dc5bc3a368677b0010d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":977,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nZD9u4ZMk40RRhyPBM8B77aT6DB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":651}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
