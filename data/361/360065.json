The Swiss, born in 1928, created more than thirty fonts, including the world-famous MÃ©ridien, Univers and Frutiger type families. Less well-known are his extraordingary freely conceived works. This film is a straightforward, sensitive portrait of the designer and his work which presents Adrian Frutiger's achievements and his relationship to nature in a new way. All the cinematography is done in High Definition, stills of the well-known Swiss cameraman Pio Corradi and the music composed by famous Swiss songwriter Hanery Amman add to the very personal portrait.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adrian Frutiger: The Man of Black and White","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Kopp","original_name":"Christine Kopp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f89081c3a368677d000398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Frutiger","original_name":"Christoph Frutiger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f890779251410818000376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0934510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
