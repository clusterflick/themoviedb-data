We will follow biologists in the field as they study and examine Sarracenia, extraordinary, carnivorous plants which can be found from Newfoundland to Florida and Texas, although most grow in the American Southeast. We learn about the dangers pitcherplants face, due to poaching and habitat fragmentation. We also learn about the conservation work taking place in the state of Georgia, to help this rare species. The film follows scientists and native plant experts as they rescue endangered plants and keep them in a safe house. They scout for ideal habitat and later convene a large team to outplant the rescued plants in a protected wildlife management area. While pitcherplants face challenges, it is encouraging to see the work being done to ensure their survival.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devouring Beauties: The Remarkable Pitcherplants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
