It is a metaphor of a love connection between two partners, fueled from the same source, but also for the power of creation that consciousness holds. This also collects and shows sections of each partnerâ€™s transformation process, revealing and underlining that everything begins and ends from and into a single point, it shows the nucleus of narratives from each individual, their symbiosis and eventually their exit. The author considers this animation a meta frame where we can be spectators to a process of creation and emotion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE CORE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
