As students across the country organize protests against Israel's war on Gaza, decades-long taboos in academia around criticism of Israel-the \"Palestine exception\"-are shattered. This film features professors and students as they join calls for a ceasefire and divestment from companies that do business with Israel and face waves of crackdown from administrators, the media, the police and politicians. Scholars from diverse disciplines explain what is at stake in these protests and why so many young people identify with the Palestinian cause. The documentary unfolds as a story of college campuses as sites of both rebellion and repression, places where personal and collective histories converge in unexpected ways.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":"/28o73MGjyFuRkhasSTE8ZLaNOto.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Palestine Exception","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Schrecker","original_name":"Ellen Schrecker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd3e9819ed2eab0346951","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Gaboury","original_name":"Jennifer Gaboury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd3feb00d3bad92bd91ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":556158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Butler","original_name":"Judith Butler","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/ijoBAhitgqH8eJ6RR8BNKeGI0zn.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd40c819ed2eab0346959","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Premilla Nadasen","original_name":"Premilla Nadasen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd41dff8a9db5e5347986","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saree Makdisi","original_name":"Saree Makdisi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd426365867535abd9c29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Smith","original_name":"Sophie Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd433b23629e7f8fbf072","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Khoury","original_name":"Ted Khoury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"679bd442365867535abd9c37","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Haaken","original_name":"Jan Haaken","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679afc33e21cbb9a5b344cca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Haaken","original_name":"Jan Haaken","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd2c8c35721885a346dc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marlene Eid","original_name":"Marlene Eid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd2e7b00d3bad92bd9199","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Ruth","original_name":"Jennifer Ruth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd347d04b03bd9f346e9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214382,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Foster","original_name":"Kevin Foster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd374819ed2eab0346930","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214383,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Praus","original_name":"Sam Praus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd385365867535abd9b83","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Harshman","original_name":"Jeff Harshman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd3a1125798ad4bbd93e4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214388,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Timothy Wildgoose","original_name":"Timothy Wildgoose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bd3bdb23629e7f8fbf055","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34459197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/28o73MGjyFuRkhasSTE8ZLaNOto.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bqRYIyxMVYbPx4QNhCT8YJkLmSx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
