[…] With scenes from Jean-Luc Godard’s PIERROT LE FOU projected behind Indiana, and a camera circling him like a shark, NORTH buzzes with turpitude, grandeur, and intelligence. It isn't a modern ‘Sentimental Education,’ but it twists the twistedness of that novel into a scary, sickening shape.” –Jerry Saltz, ARTNET","popularity":0.102,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Indiana","original_name":"Gary Indiana","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/399dMqyNxhNC0df56vQx59IG0Kl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"679b2d8f0902b69ec7fbc607","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":42748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Boskovich","original_name":"John Boskovich","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679b2d25c35721885a3450f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
