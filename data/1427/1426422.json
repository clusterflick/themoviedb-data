After touring extensively and building a reputation as one of Ireland’s leading live performers, he returns to the studio to record new music. “Anger is easy to portray, it’s the hurt that’s hard,” David says, as the film explores his wordsmithing over the course of 500 days. This is a portrait of one artist as a young man, which in turn is a portrait of every musical artist as they endeavor to stand out in a world of “algorithm and blues,” while remaining authentically and powerfully true to themselves.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ncoAxhqxH9csFHcpuohhRly1dBx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Keenan - Words on Canvas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2909151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Keenan","original_name":"David Keenan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"679bb949c35721885a346a8b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paddy Hayes","original_name":"Paddy Hayes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bb8e2ceb49e671d34693d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441148,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aisling Ní Fhlaithearta","original_name":"Aisling Ní Fhlaithearta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bb8f9b23629e7f8fbe781","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214172,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ailbhe Nic Dhonncha","original_name":"Ailbhe Nic Dhonncha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679bb912819ed2eab0346397","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cVD46u8NtRbzUfeOYp8ylBhGSWn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xjUjb5BA0nHmTQwdqsML6jbUAxE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncoAxhqxH9csFHcpuohhRly1dBx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Focla ar Chanbhás - David Keenan - Words on Canvas - new documentary film COMING SOON","key":"3_lGJLVfAH8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-01-30T08:48:48.000Z","id":"679bb8400902b69ec7fbdac8"}]}}}
