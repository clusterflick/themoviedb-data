The “good life” appears as an abstract idea that doesn't seem to be meant for him and his friends.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45460,"logo_path":"/j5tLpWUFt69O7gGHEWedNcMyLei.png","name":"Tamtam Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Regen fiel auf nichts Neues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Optimismus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2371536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steffen Goldkamp","original_name":"Steffen Goldkamp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d08582de2202ed5bdeeb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5216533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steffen Goldkamp","original_name":"Steffen Goldkamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d0862bb7269b6b34d2e1b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556995,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Otte","original_name":"Tom Otte","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d088d2de2202ed5bdeedb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dirk Decker","original_name":"Dirk Decker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d08a42de2202ed5bdeee9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661382,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Schütte","original_name":"Andrea Schütte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d08b4bb7269b6b34d2e57","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paulina Toenne","original_name":"Paulina Toenne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d08c5bb7269b6b34d2e66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877828,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jelena Maksimović","original_name":"Jelena Maksimović","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d08edacab968a584d1df5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543899,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Spengemann","original_name":"Jakob Spengemann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d090ed80170ee55012b29","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
