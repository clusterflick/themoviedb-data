Originally created to accommodate the Glasgow overspill, Cumbernauld was built using pioneering architecture for its time, especially the town centre, which was the UK's first shopping centre and the worldâ€™s first fully enclosed town centre and it will soon be demolished. This film hopes to explore how the environment of this iconic new town has changed and how its defined the generations who grew up there.
