Then, they collaborate with a team of digital artists and documentarians on a series of short films and “show and tell” multimedia events. For example, a shipping container is outfitted with luminous LED screens showcasing “video ads” for refugees’ “memory objects.” Inside the shipping containers, short documentaries are shown, followed by immersive video chats.  Immersive media installations have been presented at UC Berkeley’s Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life and –in collaboration with Shared Studios– on New York’s Times Square.","popularity":0.4814,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What We Carry With Us: Refugee Storylabs","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3695128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Ball","original_name":"Sam Ball","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/uycEduSLLLetiVZA3WCYialkDp0.jpg","credit_id":"679bf91995d883ff25011502","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie E.
