He barely earns enough to cover Europe's high cost of living. An acquaintance introduces him to Madame Chiara, gemstone collector who hires him to go to Colombia and steal an emerald. Despite Machado's insistence of the danger involved in his returning to Colombia, Chiara convinces him to go by offering him a sum of money he can't refuse.
