In 1999, The Berkeley School District created its groundbreaking food policy with the goal to “provide nutritious, fresh, tasty, locally grown food that reflects Berkeley’s cultural diversity.” Ten years later, the School Lunch Initiative has realized that vision. “Lunch Love Community” presents a multilayered story of an economically and ethnically diverse community persisting over a decade to reinvent school lunch, and integrate it into an innovative cooking and gardening curriculum. Berkeley’s community of cooks, educators, parents, health advocates, politicians and vendors is now leading the national movement to eliminate childhood obesity, and change the way our children eat.","popularity":0.1795,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":219008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thirty Leaves Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lunch Love Community Documentary Project","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie E.
