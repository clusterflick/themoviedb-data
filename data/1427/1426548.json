After a happy start in life, surrounded by family, Simone finds herself alone, as members of her family disappear one by one. Three years on, and she’s still alone - a social animal, a primate, just like us; how has this isolation affected her mental state? Through primatologist Dr. Patricia Wright and researcher, Alba Schielen, we witness Simone’s desperate bid for companionship, as she takes a bold step for survival. At last Simone is happy again, but is all as harmonious as it seems?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/qwbCdPUNgJtiL66rPm5lGbzQXTo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surviving Alone: The Tale of Simone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Tomlinson","original_name":"Claire Tomlinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c08a6acab968a584d0984","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qwbCdPUNgJtiL66rPm5lGbzQXTo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
