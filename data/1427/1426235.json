'Faces', a comment on the personas we adopt, was inspired by a visit to the Brussels Experimental Film Festival of 1958 where McConnell saw the work of many European film makers, films of a genre unseen at that time in Britain.

times.","popularity":0.2281,"poster_path":"/ovp6WgT4QNmhAvLNQCcr9A6ILSc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Templar Film
