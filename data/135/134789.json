It is comprised entirely of found 16mm footage that had been discarded. The sadness, the isolation, and the desire to escape are recorded on film in various contexts. Voice-over readings from the journal kept by a brother of the filmmakerâ€™s friend who committed suicide in 1990 intermix with a range of compelling stories, from the poignant double suicide of an elderly American couple to a Japanese teenager who jumped into a volcano, spawning over a thousand imitations. While this is a serious exploration of a cultural taboo, its lyrical qualities invite the viewer to approach the subject with understanding and compassion.","popularity":0.1823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Darkness of Day","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Berning","original_name":"Beverly Berning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5300aa309251416ad230f5da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard J.
