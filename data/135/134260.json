We meet one of the few exorcists in Europe, the Vatican approved Jos√© Antonio Fortea. He travels around the world on a mission to enlighten the masses about demonic possession. Constanza, a Colombian woman, is desperately looking for Fr. Forteas help. She claims to have been possessed by demons for nearly 15 years and she goes through a ritual of exorcism before she sees the Spanish exorcist as a last hope for spiritual liberation. The film follows both their journeys and gives a unique insight into one of the world most secret and mystical rites - the catholic ritual of exorcism.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exorcist in the 21st Century","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2351393","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
