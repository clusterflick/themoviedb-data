Relegated to small venues and touring in a crappy van through the Midwest they careen between the desire to succeed and the reality that there may be nothing left to lose. Road life is far from glamorous: comics come and go and cruel pranks and hard drinking punctuate their obsidian dark comedy on stage. They succeed and fail-spectacularly. When they face being fired for going too far on stage, the conflict culminates in a showdown: compromise or double down?","popularity":0.2738,"poster_path":"/ujUJUlmSJFX6PzcqmhABzk0XSMC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
