There is mesmeric archive and rare photographs of the making of the film. The main location of the documentary is Ford’s ancestral homeland of Connemara, on the west coat of Ireland, where his parents were born. We meet Ford’s cousins, the Feeney’s who  tell the story of Ford’s parent’s departure from Ireland after the Great Famine and the young Ford’s return to Ireland in 1922 to visit his cousins the Thornton’s and saw their house being burned down by the infamous Black and Tans. Ford,  under the pretense of scouting locations for a movie,  gave money to the IRA.  We travel to Portland Maine where Ford grew up and went on to become a director in the first bloom of Hollywood. The boy made it good but Ireland was always on his mind.","popularity":0.7968,"poster_path":"/vn8O4z0q1M9FK4p9ckHmYObxy3g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2012-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Ford: Dreaming the Quiet Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dreaming the Quiet Man","type":"short title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Byrne","original_name":"Gabriel Byrne","popularity":1.6866,"profile_path":"/9r9oDGENg92VYYFMkV4C09IUlrb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4bc1c3a368484e197e95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen O'Hara","original_name":"Maureen O'Hara","popularity":0.5298,"profile_path":"/cZ9paCScbYICu1J3jv7cQwiQauH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4bc1c3a368484e197e99","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","original_name":"Peter Bogdanovich","popularity":0.8766,"profile_path":"/m3aMMYzzEbqKEwGOyEPq7Rt1gAj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55e62620c3a3685f870005db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Scorsese","original_name":"Martin Scorsese","popularity":2.5528,"profile_path":"/9U9Y5GQuWX3EZy39B8nkk4NY01S.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55e626349251410f1700063c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Sheridan","original_name":"Jim Sheridan","popularity":0.2074,"profile_path":"/aWTmBt44TyUCb0t50avtFsPdTPp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55e6264ac3a3685f96000736","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1098280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sé Merry Doyle","original_name":"Sé Merry Doyle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bc1c3a368484e197e8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1098304,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephan Walsh","original_name":"Stephan Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bc1c3a368484e197e91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1756489","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fBovlOLJYZMk6GttgDgM6sCTboJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vn8O4z0q1M9FK4p9ckHmYObxy3g.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xt4m87XiKuQl459v726n9L6tV3U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1608,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c7l7x3r1Gb7c6v0Pm4m5q5sZZM7.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1072},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/km7SNmO5SqKgCuRtoeOLA7L5a0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"John Ford: Dreaming The Quiet Man Official Trailer","key":"B60lTf7LrK8","published_at":"2012-05-24T12:53:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec6f1c3a36854480093d3"}]}}}
