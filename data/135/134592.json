But, contrary to the producers’ expectation, the Left lost. Ruiz seized on this anti-climax to make a documentary about nothing except itself – a film whose central subject is forever lost in digression and ‘dispersal’, harking back to his Chilean experiments of the ‘60s. Its political content is deliberately left negligible: it’s hard to tell at the end who did actually win the election, let alone why.","popularity":0.2013,"poster_path":"/hPMoRgO0RunPejLX9slQlnYZuJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Great Events and Ordinary People","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Des grands événements et des gens ordinaires: Les Élections","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Of Great Events and Ordinary People","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd9c3a368484e19bcc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159388,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Ede","original_name":"François Ede","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bd9c3a368484e19bcc1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd9c3a368484e19bcbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134464,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeria Sarmiento","original_name":"Valeria Sarmiento","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/heyXSDnTvdX3wVLbfwE2Qtclf2S.jpg","credit_id":"5b10c7160e0a2630710109fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187095,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jacques Bouquin","original_name":"Jacques Bouquin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fee92ef4a4bf60040d4c1d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280470,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dominique Forgue","original_name":"Dominique Forgue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fee92fa4e4dff0040964e9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280471,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alain Salomon","original_name":"Alain Salomon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fee9301140bad003fa3d939","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0079032","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1608,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hPMoRgO0RunPejLX9slQlnYZuJh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1072},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vw1S6xblDHs9p7i1RiMVpnL2b41.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mKnpXMZffsoRVOyCrQlghzUduIB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Internationales Forum des Jungen Films, Berlin ","release_date":"1980-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
