Rancher Everet Cates is preparing to sell of his top horses when banker Samuel Mortimer sets his sights on the family business. Desperate, Everet's son Bowie botches his attempt to steal the mine payroll, prompting his feisty sister Eryn to steal his disguise, and misdirect the posse. Meanwhile, as Eryn embraces her newfound freedom outside the law, Mortimer begins using the bandit as a patsy in a scheme to steal his own money back. Later, when a pair of Texas Rangers shows up to investigate the case, Eryn finds herself falling for the same lawman who seeks to throw the bandit in prison, and prepares to make the most difficult decision of her life.","popularity":0.3089,"poster_path":"/iFwwJlvve9kC83cuPEB5kJgKvRB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell's Fury: Wanted Dead or Alive","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hells Fury","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Reach for the Sky","type":"Release Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1098586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Hague","original_name":"Hannah Hague","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eryn Cates","credit_id":"52fe4bcbc3a368484e199833","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1098587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Hagenbaugh","original_name":"Adam Hagenbaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Flint","credit_id":"52fe4bcbc3a368484e199837","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Harris","original_name":"Ron Harris","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":"/8bm1C9aokFhJa8A5DEzQFv1xCG6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mortimer","credit_id":"52fe4bcbc3a368484e19983b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1944119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard L.
