Her psychiatrist encourages her to move forward with her life. However, as she attempts to do so she finds reality too difficult to contend with as she is bound to the events of the past.  As she tries to sort things out for herself, Cindy spirals into a wacky world of bizarre situations that become increasingly influenced by a murder mystery she is writing.  In the end, Cindy discovers that she must act as her own emancipator in order to free herself from the role she thinks she is expected to play.","popularity":0.2172,"poster_path":"/nYWrBwio2cNBFhIPcHWqxRNaeCr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Abe Lincoln's really a girl","title":"My Life as Abraham Lincoln","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Luft","original_name":"Caroline Luft","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/n7jzh9t8SVv022x0ro9ckvUk5Xe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cindy Rossberg","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19baff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerry Birnbach","original_name":"Gerry Birnbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Calvin","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Lynn Malloy","original_name":"Jennifer Lynn Malloy","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Holly","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1099352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Nelson","original_name":"Trevor Nelson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb0b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Callahan","original_name":"Corinne Callahan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Young Cindy","credit_id":"5ed86254fea0d7001d8ad25a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Cosgrove","original_name":"Colleen Cosgrove","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mother / Receptionist","credit_id":"5ed8625d96e30b0022963044","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon deSpain","original_name":"Brandon deSpain","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/sfqkQEZfpm7WiHBBcsw2Gcrsa8Z.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"5ed86266fea0d7001f8cbd5c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erzen Krivca","original_name":"Erzen Krivca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Phtgr, Det.
