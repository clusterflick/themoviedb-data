After burying his last remaining companion, a fearless explorer has to find his way to the North Pole alone, fighting snow-blindness and physical strain. An unexpected encounter forces him to decide between honor and fame in the history books or keeping the moral high ground—a choice which will haunt the rest of his life.  Although taking place in the early 1910s, The Devil's Ballroom tells a timeless tale of greed, self-sacrifice, the blinding yearn for success and the sacred myth surrounding European explorers.","popularity":0.148,"poster_path":"/u3cVeigzMDGNHPtVHwAfxgr625R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Ballroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svein Harry Hauge","original_name":"Svein Harry Hauge","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/cJi8kkeCBn6ReQBWToVgQoYSGKp.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"The Explorer","credit_id":"5a2c70649251410329147aac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1099360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narmandakh Erdenee","original_name":"Narmandakh Erdenee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ayla","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marte Tangen","original_name":"Marte Tangen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Explorer's Wife","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Bokeli","original_name":"Melinda Bokeli","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Explorer's Daughter","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Batzorig Chinbayar","original_name":"Batzorig Chinbayar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Allakariallak","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb53","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1099354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken","original_name":"Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/1AXNJAeCz0obA1GANYbM2xxPdeB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb4f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1099354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken","original_name":"Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/1AXNJAeCz0obA1GANYbM2xxPdeB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wencke Hovet","original_name":"Wencke Hovet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb33","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Department Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janne Lindgren","original_name":"Janne Lindgren","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mAtwHvbxeAmaATNQ5OyvVvaGz9o.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099357,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anders Granlund","original_name":"Anders Granlund","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a368484e19bb49","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2354201","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfNklCLSW9Hkwc6wC7P8rj5szQl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u3cVeigzMDGNHPtVHwAfxgr625R.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1182},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hz5MTvqUUjLyY23XCKwisjeiGzZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1182},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5GzkdMosNag1mztWiuMBEBBrAm7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1182}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
