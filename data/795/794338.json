Bria begins to question the oppressive environment she is accustomed to and interacts with people her father deems as “rebels”. In the midst of the chaos, Bria finds solace in twenty-year-old Didienne Ngaga. Confident and fun-loving, Didienne is entirely sure of herself despite the chaos around them. Bria grows closer to Didienne and despite great disapproval, their relationship blossoms into something much more than Bria ever expected.","popularity":0.0647,"poster_path":"/yL4XliRGCDsxBy5UjkoDg1M36VL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limelight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2189049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Sunday","original_name":"Joy Sunday","popularity":0.4002,"profile_path":"/fTajkqbVGMU4O2LMteuYlffhfJI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Didienne","credit_id":"601f443d458199003ea4c7c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigin Ojulu","original_name":"Sigin Ojulu","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bria","credit_id":"601f4449f85958003ddc339e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2968086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peterjohn Minto","original_name":"Peterjohn Minto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Luc","credit_id":"601f445ae27260003e71d602","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2968087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Londole","original_name":"Tito Londole","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Chassa","credit_id":"601f446e5690b500401f50e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Michel Richaud","original_name":"Jean-Michel Richaud","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/dZYdnxo2iX3mbKsu3LjcM51VWfv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Giroux","credit_id":"601f44915ed962003f19260d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Gallo","original_name":"Jessica Gallo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"News Anchor","credit_id":"601f44a60e597b003fa133f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2968089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moses Jackson","original_name":"Moses Jackson","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Militia","credit_id":"601f44b5263462003ef5870e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Gostin","original_name":"Claire Gostin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601f43ea0c27100042ef2fad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2968084,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Telfer","original_name":"Anna Telfer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601f4426458199003ea4c772","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12849716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yL4XliRGCDsxBy5UjkoDg1M36VL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
