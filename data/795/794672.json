Though rarely attracting a great deal of notice, there are always individuals collecting signatures for a referendum to dissolve the parliament for one reason or another, or simply standing outside the building and reciting their familiar mantra.  Latvian governments change fairly often, but the parliament has been dissolved in line wth the Constitution only once, in 2010 (in 1934 it was dissolved unconstitutionally following a coup by Prime Minister K훮rlis Ulmanis). The actual parliament building in Old R카ga was, however, attacked in January 2009 during a very rare violent protest which precipitated the fall of Ivars Godmanis' cabinet.  The documentary zips back and forth in time giving portraits of various different people and political forces pushing the idea to \"Atlaist Saeimu\" for different reasons.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/9gqs48qYO0C0nFiofm1M33wRDBO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118793,"logo_path":"/AckxUfY5wGZjKNnbiWDKubqxX8t.png","name":"Latvijas Televizija","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":126600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentarian","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Misunderstood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2484409,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Haralds Ozols","original_name":"Haralds Ozols","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614fbbe8397561008c5cd17d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2484409,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Haralds Ozols","original_name":"Haralds Ozols","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614fbbf6a9b9a400910ae94c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Zviedris","original_name":"Ivars Zviedris","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nwLWM3dH7coDqlXzJgylb0uFegA.jpg","credit_id":"614fbc07e8a3e10062177158","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599454,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivars Ozols","original_name":"Ivars Ozols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614fbc2cc3514c00436c4965","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Zviedris","original_name":"Ivars Zviedris","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nwLWM3dH7coDqlXzJgylb0uFegA.jpg","credit_id":"614fbc62124c8d0043b7382e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247748,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zane Ma훾e","original_name":"Zane Ma훾e","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614fbc74b04605004482b1ce","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Zviedris","original_name":"Ivars Zviedris","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nwLWM3dH7coDqlXzJgylb0uFegA.jpg","credit_id":"6020a7d33ff2df003fbb63eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gqs48qYO0C0nFiofm1M33wRDBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
