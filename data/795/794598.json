Remember that you must die. The time-honoured Latin expression became the starting point for a highly introspective performance. Cherkaoui analyses a sense of boredom that imbues our daily lives, the fleetingness of life and the question of what remains after we die. The atmospheric music of the French singer-songwriter Woodkid supplies an emotionally rich soundscape.  In both of these personal performances, Cherkaoui connects the classical ballet technique with his own highly individual, 'fluid' contemporary dance idiom, which is steeped in countless influences. It is never about the movement itself, but always, the connection between two sequences. These create an eternal language of movement that also reflects the theme of flourishing and decline, loss and memory, in the dance.","popularity":0.1223,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Remember that you must die","title":"Memento Mori - Opera Ballet Vlaanderen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357009,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui","original_name":"Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/4FDPjIkI6yjfewt6XllpZtBDcYL.jpg","credit_id":"60204ac10e597b003ea2d873","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
