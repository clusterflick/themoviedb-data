The film was begun in a \"blue\" moment a year ago, returned to during the Covid19 pandemic and lockdown in New York City. It's pace, melancholy, and concentration on the everyday, rather than the grandiose, seem particularly suited to this moment in history. As well it returns again and again to themes of mortality and goodbye. The result is allusive and idiosyncratic, exhibiting cross-national globalism within and through the adjacencies of form and content.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/lqHKN7HcGq9dAMN1k6qveXqBLbY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BLUE EDIT","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abigail Child","original_name":"Abigail Child","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6021fb195690b5003f23ec46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lqHKN7HcGq9dAMN1k6qveXqBLbY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
