After showing a car ride across the dunes and the fierce waves of the sea, this unfinished film shows the pleasure at the beach on a sunny day. On the seashore, young and old enjoy the sun, sand and sea. In a quick succession of images with sometimes surprising camera angles and movements, the film shows the seaside fun. At some moments, the filmmaker makes links by using evocative cuts. For example, recumbent seaside visitors are linked with basking pigs and a dangerously swirling sea displays a skull.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/82PvAOoh2W9s5ZvlVJLpbLfUBXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looks at the Zoo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiel van Moerkerken","original_name":"Emiel van Moerkerken","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lcXE9Q0f88jR7PBHyXLEK8IHCXl.jpg","credit_id":"601f11ca0e597b003ca0cf33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/82PvAOoh2W9s5ZvlVJLpbLfUBXa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
