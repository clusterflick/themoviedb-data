It implicitly comments on and critiques the 'confessional' modes of video and its illusion of real presence. It thus rejects that was at the time a dominant style in artist's video, turning on its head the simpler versions of the slogan that 'the personal is political'. At the same time it is a political work in a different sense, questioning the popular TV format of the in-depth personal interview which it ironizes. As such, and with Partridge himself playing the part of interviewer/director, it is his most overt 'intervention' into documentary drama even as he subverts it.\" - Al Rees","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/q5t1M2nhHtVM7F47gNnrwPGjESU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Annalogue Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogue for Two Players","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Bennett","original_name":"Ian Bennett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Player","credit_id":"6021efdf6dc5070040c09f0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jude Allen","original_name":"Jude Allen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Player","credit_id":"6021efefc2b9df003f9ea599","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Ridley","original_name":"Anna Ridley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654a28ed41a561336d85eadd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Partridge","original_name":"Stephen Partridge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6021ef885690b50040233222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q5t1M2nhHtVM7F47gNnrwPGjESU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1984-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
