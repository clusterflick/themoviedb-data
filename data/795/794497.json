Adding an addictive pop ingredient to their already potent brew paid off handsomely for the band, and opened their sound up to a whole new audience. To their surprise, Jefferson Starship landed two number one singles during this extremely productive time for the band, namely \"We Built This City,\" and \"Sara.\" GREATEST VIDEO HITS gathers a selection of their music videos from 1981-1987, paying tribute to their work from that era. As well as the aforementioned songs, promo's for \"It's Not Over ('Til It's Over),\" \"Find Your Way Back,\" \"Be My Lady,\" and many others are all included.","popularity":0.2323,"poster_path":"/v3ZQGl4n2SbrnUvy1RPLzMuP0zC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jefferson Starship: Greatest Video Hits","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Thomas","original_name":"Mickey Thomas","popularity":0.171,"profile_path":"/ie2tJ36fMeJdzMsDB4pBJLyTZJK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"633b7e5c87f3f2007f2f319d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Slick","original_name":"Grace Slick","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/eeWfLbrA2rPSK68zGU7DYQPv1N8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"633b7e66cf48a1007dbc31e0","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gprVCVmsML0L02VECwL2EJ8kmon.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v3ZQGl4n2SbrnUvy1RPLzMuP0zC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
