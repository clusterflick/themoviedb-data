Richter’s “4900 Colors” was created by mixing the three primary colors in graduated amounts. The artist produced 196 unique panels composed of 25 squares. The placement and positioning of the panels is arbitrary. I used a computer program to combined 17 shades of each primary color and to randomly distribute them in five-by-five grids. My title frame is an homage to Richter’s “Cologne Cathedral Windows.”","popularity":0.0517,"poster_path":"/y1e48UiHKynCmtqEUXBuPRUvTg7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4913 Colors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Bessoir","original_name":"Tom Bessoir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6021e87ddd25890040b99933","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1e48UiHKynCmtqEUXBuPRUvTg7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
