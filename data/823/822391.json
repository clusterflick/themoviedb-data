The initial idea quickly evolved into a full film exploring the formation of an idea from the hidden depths of the mind, spiralling and rising through different stages of consciousness, until finally crystallising as a fully-formed idea.  The film’s title, Idein, is the ancient Greek word meaning ‘to see’.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/dOsjkKEu1hFzVfe57LAleriz042.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"animation, short film","title":"Idein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3065967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Helene","original_name":"Sebastian Helene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60845b6156b9f7006de6c640","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dOsjkKEu1hFzVfe57LAleriz042.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
