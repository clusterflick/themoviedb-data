Toritaro and Sachiko live modestly. Every year, when \"that day\" comes, the two, who do not have a grave, throw a handmade lantern with the girl Chitose into a nearby river to commemorate the dead. The memories of the earthquake were fading from the people, but Toritaro had a big scar that never disappeared. Anxiety was spreading in the town. It grew bigger and bigger.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qYUlrL8ne8akZ4pc1V526EuP68.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karagara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Morita","original_name":"Hiroyuki Morita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60854d0ec439c000406aefdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066801,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yuichi Nakano","original_name":"Yuichi Nakano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608554428d22fc007722d3cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Morita","original_name":"Hiroyuki Morita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60854d46960cde00593aa675","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044162,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shigeto Nakamura","original_name":"Shigeto Nakamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608554579a8a8a00589c20d4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Morita","original_name":"Hiroyuki Morita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60854d51c439c000406af001","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066800,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Taihiro Arafuna","original_name":"Taihiro Arafuna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085542e4cd9120041699b6f","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2L1xklZglpqmBSOdSkX3mLMEoPY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qYUlrL8ne8akZ4pc1V526EuP68.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"映画「カラガラ」予告編","key":"oH-4E4sV2mw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-14T14:55:31.000Z","id":"616c91233d4d96008d6d4a0e"}]}}}
