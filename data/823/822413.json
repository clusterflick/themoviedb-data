Through his art and his life, Chief-Moon's story is one of cultural survival. Themes of his dance creations begin with his people's traditional stories, his attachment to the land and his community, as well as the inner conflict he faces in existing within the Aboriginal culture and the wider community. The documentary also explores his identity as a First Nations two-spirited gay man and a father of three adopted children. His art and his life cross boundaries. Challenging the cultural construct is never easy; but Chief-Moon does.","popularity":0.1919,"poster_path":"/yAT64a82ecZbgbWdwz9LFu1fddk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mouvement Perpétuel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Byron Chief-Moon: Grey Horse Rider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Chief-Moon","original_name":"Byron Chief-Moon","popularity":0.2789,"profile_path":"/dPjZrIPCjkDB0zjfn7is0tDaz84.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608474b12c6b7b0041f64b5d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066083,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Basque","original_name":"Nicolas Basque","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608475062c6b7b002a6cd0e8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2816393,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Malloch","original_name":"James Malloch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608474fcbefb09006ea92a9a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Stonier","original_name":"Dave Stonier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608475379a8a8a00288b018a","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marlene Millar","original_name":"Marlene Millar","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608474d565e0a2003fb9dd6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flint Eagle","original_name":"Flint Eagle","popularity":0.2725,"profile_path":"/lJ8prWbNNz7GVpoRSsQgLtkmyQs.jpg","credit_id":"6084751b960cde00412a956b","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Portillo","original_name":"René Portillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6084752d01b1ca0077ae21a6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Szporer","original_name":"Philip Szporer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608474deffc9de004068e9fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884327,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Huard","original_name":"Nick Huard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608474f256b9f700573d84a3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Szporer","original_name":"Philip Szporer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6084754b84448e004122582f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Troy Emery Twigg","original_name":"Troy Emery Twigg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60847510befb09006ea92ad1","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marlene Millar","original_name":"Marlene Millar","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60847542ffc9de0058dc7adb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2884323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul M.
