By focusing on the construction and performance of masculinity in yeosung gukgeuk, siren excavates histories of non-normative gender identities, intimacies, and sexualities in Korea.  Deferral Theatre engages in the works and life stories of three contemporary artists: Nam Eun-jin (a male-role yeosung gukgeuk actor), Minhee Park (a traditional gagok performer) and drag king Azangman, provoking questions around the patriarchal invention of a “tradition” and gender norms.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/iWgrzOpHZX7GTgtnAuiGl9VWIxH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deferral Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drag king Azangman","original_name":"Drag king Azangman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"608333299a8a8a002888c281","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nam Eun Jin","original_name":"Nam Eun Jin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"608333319e4586006f2e07b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2310670,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Park Min-hui","original_name":"Park Min-hui","popularity":0.0452,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60833346a06645002bcdb63d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Jeun","original_name":"Lee Jeun","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6083334ef92532005a9f0b86","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeong Eonjin","original_name":"Jeong Eonjin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60833356387651006e84ba4d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cho Young Sook","original_name":"Cho Young Sook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6083336bc439c0007946aea7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"siren eun young jung","original_name":"siren eun young jung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608333d1f92532005a9f0ca2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146837,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chung Hyeri","original_name":"Chung Hyeri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608333f156b9f7006de54b74","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Heein","original_name":"Lee Heein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608333e12da84600297eea35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/iWgrzOpHZX7GTgtnAuiGl9VWIxH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Korea Artist Prize 2018","release_date":"2018-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
