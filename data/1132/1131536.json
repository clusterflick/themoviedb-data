But with Linda Blair's disturbing performance in The Exorcist, Satan returned with a vengeance and since then films about demonic possession have fascinated viewers worldwide. However, was the visage of Satan that returned Biblical or distorted? And how have these images influenced society's view of the demonic and spiritual warfare? In this thought provoking documentary, these questions are examined with objectivity and insight from psychologists, modern-day exorcists and leading voices in Christianity.","popularity":0.5478,"poster_path":"/sO3mslfMRUajSIvh9K5UDkDWLYp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battling Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Blair","original_name":"Linda Blair","popularity":1.2681,"profile_path":"/3jswDdLDsmSAO4ZtVPwyKAp6D5d.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646fc412c5ada500fb7237ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4080668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil T.
