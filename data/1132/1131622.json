This act of ‘translating’ a garment made by the artist’s ancestors and from animals in their environment, is part of the artist’s overall practice of ‘singing, sounding and dancing’ cultural belongings. Lukin Linklater argues that Indigenous knowledges are held in the body and activated physically “in relation to these belongings, to our families, to the land, to the universe.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Wear One Another","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Lukin Linklater","original_name":"Tanya Lukin Linklater","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647004d6336e0100e80c07cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
