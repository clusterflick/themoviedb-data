The case remains unsolved and therefore becomes a myth and the film sets out to discover what this and a myth actually is, namely an expression of past history in time and space. We see like in a very old play the appearance of the actors playing the myth, who become more and more intensely mythical themselves. They speak up and yet suffer, they are just playing and yet they are guilty. The narrator, the choir, the revenge, the madness, the love, the death. This is what Blue is made of!","popularity":0.2659,"poster_path":"/buVhQw3vQFW0YuDwZplmnCHsSDo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Kilo of Blue (The Music)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4079659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Åke Johansson","original_name":"Sven Åke Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Erzähler","credit_id":"646efcc907216600fa6c2d24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Pettibon","original_name":"Raymond Pettibon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"646ef836894ed600bf7779b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olaf Möller","original_name":"Olaf Möller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"646ef84417c4430136087f09","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4079650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cony Theis","original_name":"Cony Theis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"646ef84ee22d2816af271dff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"646ef85571ffdf00c4519bf8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4079660,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner Fleischer","original_name":"Werner Fleischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646efd12894ed60133b18747","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Heiter","original_name":"Jürgen Heiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646efd99894ed600dc831eb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Heiter","original_name":"Jürgen Heiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646efd0217c44300df2dbacd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Heiter","original_name":"Jürgen Heiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646efd7bea3949013421b146","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Pfeiffer","original_name":"Ulrike Pfeiffer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646efd3f17c4430119b0bfe8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Heiter","original_name":"Jürgen Heiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646efd2ce22d2816ae99a25c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Heiter","original_name":"Jürgen Heiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ef86a71ffdf00e522396e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/buVhQw3vQFW0YuDwZplmnCHsSDo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Filmhaus Kino Köln","release_date":"2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
