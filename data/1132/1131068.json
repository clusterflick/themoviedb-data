As part of the application, there are six medical conditions which qualify a person for a placard. These conditions include: (1) cannot walk two hundred feet without stopping to rest; (2) cannot walk without the use of an assistance device; (3) is restricted by lung disease; (4) uses portable oxygen; (5) has a cardiac condition; (6) is severely limited in their ability to walk due to an arthritic, neurological, or orthopedic conditions. Many people with disabilities are included in these categories, and many are not. This film is a record of my introduction to healthcare in the state of Utah. My processing of the appointment and consequential aftermath as a video object serves as a reclamation and assertion for understanding disability and the physical world otherwise.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/3WJKniNbGS9c8Jf6NtqhfGFLx80.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kym McDaniel","original_name":"Kym McDaniel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654f6c882866fa10928cdce2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WJKniNbGS9c8Jf6NtqhfGFLx80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
