The stilled narrative suggests themes such as generalized surveillance, the metamorphosis of the political regime only on the surface in post-communism, the impossibility of escaping from a system – favorite themes of the 90s. Through its metaphorical stylistics, the film is part of a tradition with which the films produced by the National Theatre & Film Academy (ATF) would be associated. -Gabriela Filippi","popularity":0.1465,"poster_path":"/yB2k9j8VtLTsz9CyNbx4ZkWukID.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Academia de Teatru şi Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chameleon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Rîlea","original_name":"Marian Rîlea","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/v44foePbcQoWieRAQp1q9do2Cd3.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"646fe74ac5ada50135838189","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gheorghe Visu","original_name":"Gheorghe Visu","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/sF1O44PyKqaPjuRfNBAqQl0txdY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"646fe75413a320013385a87a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mihai Bisericanu","original_name":"Mihai Bisericanu","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/5BfU0rwZ6sjHD7z9NzCQI5NR0e0.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"646fe75bc5ada500a82d989e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4080830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patric Petre Marin","original_name":"Patric Petre Marin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"646fe767c5ada501358381a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ionuț Antonie","original_name":"Ionuț Antonie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"646fe76e77070001367eb984","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Zaharescu","original_name":"Andrei Zaharescu","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"646fe777726fb100c2e576c2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandru Solomon","original_name":"Alexandru Solomon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fd9d4336e0100c7074a27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandru Solomon","original_name":"Alexandru Solomon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fe683726fb10102ed9423","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dragoş Buhagiar","original_name":"Dragoş Buhagiar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fe721726fb100c2e5769f","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2377398,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anatol Vieru","original_name":"Anatol Vieru","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/qpNmAcOujVdexwWw9T1ATNSKqud.jpg","credit_id":"646fe6bd7707000119242e37","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2083483,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Calin Potcoava","original_name":"Calin Potcoava","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fe6c8c5ada500c1a2f59c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4080829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gențiana Hîrtu","original_name":"Gențiana Hîrtu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fe6f8336e01012acf2278","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2703550,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Dana Busoiu","original_name":"Dana Busoiu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fe73d5437f500e420ca0d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374234,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melania Oproiu","original_name":"Melania Oproiu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fe6605437f500c327d339","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yB2k9j8VtLTsz9CyNbx4ZkWukID.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":280617,"name":"student film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
