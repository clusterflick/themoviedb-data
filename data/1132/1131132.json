At the beginning of the Russian campaign on 22 June 1941, the \"Edelweiss Division\" ran into a buildup of 122 Red Army divisions with over 10,000 tanks and 91 air squadrons on the southern front alone. In the toughest of battles, the mountain troops fought their way to the summit of Mount Elbrus - the highest mountain in the Caucasus! - and set military as well as alpinistic standards of almost superhuman performance. In moving eyewitness accounts, illustrated by gripping original footage, the triumphant march and ordeal of the 1st Mountain Division from June 1941 to December 1942 is traced under the leadership of the renowned British book and film author.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/d4iikZ5H68UsPnpGDpyxLlvpqnA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edition Montanus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Von Garmisch in den Kaukasus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Von Garmisch in den Kaukasus - Die Geschichte der 1.
