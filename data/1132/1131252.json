The genre of the cartoon is completely uncharacteristic for the USSR: throughout the entire animation not a single line is uttered, but only songs in rock and roll style. The melodies, completely unusual for the USSR, but on topics that were quite relevant at that time, were written by the composer Anatoly Kiselyov. The animation breaks away from Samsonovs mellow oil paint-style developed in the first half of the 80s, with a much more raw and brusque kind of style followed up by the 1988 short 32 December, also a completely rock musical animation with music form the same group as this one.","popularity":0.2237,"poster_path":"/zCgoDsmfjicm1PgGaSffuzcnI4e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6608,"logo_path":"/eALlDyTQSw5rLU1IJvYps4himcU.png","name":"Ekran","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brownies, or a Dream on a Winter Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Domovye, ili son v zimnyuyu noch","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Samsonov","original_name":"Владимир Самсонов","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":"/dUwrJDkKpQvlHCk1YXp55Rv1Lq1.jpg","credit_id":"646ecd016743fa013eb7e0f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6389252","wikidata_id":"Q4165923","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1497,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/zCgoDsmfjicm1PgGaSffuzcnI4e.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
