They each try looking for new jobs in town but can't find anyone hiring. With bills piling up and no jobs available, they struggle to make ends meet. Then one day, by chance, Leah comes across a gunrunner hiding a bag of AK-47's. Leah strikes up a deal with the gunrunner to buy his guns and sell them on the black market.
