This work, which was featured in Paik’s first solo exhibition in New York, consists of a seventeen-inch black-and-white set on which an industrial-sized magnet rests. The magnetic field interferes with the television’s electronic signals, distorting the broadcast image into an abstract form that changes when the magnet is moved. Paik’s radical action undermines the seemingly inviolable power of broadcast television by transforming the TV set into a sculpture, one whose moving image is created by chance procedures and can be manipulated at will.","popularity":0.0501,"poster_path":"/50ajvDRwZn3ZNMMhxhT2qJxwKr1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magnet TV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"646ea1d71130bd01ef3f752f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/50ajvDRwZn3ZNMMhxhT2qJxwKr1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Magnet TV (1965) by Nam June Paik","key":"UjTf2pIAZNM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-17T02:51:36.000Z","id":"65fe33251b1f3c0163974498"}]}}}
