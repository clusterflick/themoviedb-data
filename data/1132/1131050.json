These birds find freedom where other animals perish, yet owe their mobility in the urban space to a long history of domestication. Through their alignment with our species, pigeons inhabit a unique position in which they are both at odds with and dependent upon humans. coo-coo was shot entirely on one roll of 16mm film with all visual cuts made in-camera.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4iH2HvWndjFDNDqNZtEXjBuD8gq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coo-Coo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4078716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ella Harmon","original_name":"Ella Harmon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646e37041130bd01fa1f3726","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4iH2HvWndjFDNDqNZtEXjBuD8gq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
