He has been famous as \"Watching Teacher\". Atsushi is delighted with his wife, Chikako's pregnancy report. Late at night, they believe in the doctor's words that they are fine if they can do it, and they gently love each other. It is reported that Chikako's father has been hospitalized, and Chikako returns home in a hurry. Atsushi remained. When she got home, there was a young woman, Kasumi, squatting in front of the door. She seemed to visit a former resident of the room. However, she tries to return.  Kasumi went to Tokyo and had no other acquaintance and refused to contact his parents. His willingness to help her loses her sweet temptation. Atsushi, who hates himself for betraying his wife, tries to introduce a psychologist, Toda, who led him to this path, but Kasumi refused and she left. Before relieving Atsushi, a woman wearing a monk, Saki, came to visit this time.","popularity":0.3016,"poster_path":"/lQU0Z9b9ACleQqk2SB03VJu9NOS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raihô-sha X: Chijo yûgi","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Raihô-sha X: Chijo yûgi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2384042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukine Sakuragi","original_name":"桜木優希音","popularity":2.225,"profile_path":"/n3otC9ce0BUGPqpcgNvlfA2YwMK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Saki Kusunoki","credit_id":"5ec9420b7f1d830020dccac3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsuna Kimura","original_name":"Tsuna Kimura","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mana Matsumura","credit_id":"5e883d23d55c3d00155121ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shôta Kotaki","original_name":"Shôta Kotaki","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hiroyuki Toda","credit_id":"5e883d36b84f940014c9a403","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2650631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miki Sunohara","original_name":"春原未来","popularity":2.216,"profile_path":"/blwN0cQt8tdp5UP2FandnoBK3ba.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chikako Masaki","credit_id":"5ec947686c8492001f2b3d31","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2650632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uta Sachino","original_name":"Uta Sachino","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kasumi Mizuishi","credit_id":"5ec94788d2147c0021b7e05a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Najima","original_name":"Shin Najima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Atsushi Masaki","credit_id":"5ec947a2a35c8e0020e27103","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Abukawa","original_name":"Karen Abukawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Female interviewer","credit_id":"5ec947af7f1d830020dccf25","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Minoru Kunizawa","original_name":"国沢実","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e883cee24f2ce0011667c03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1995710,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuta Takahashi","original_name":"Yuta Takahashi","popularity":0.1832,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e883cfd60b58d0015ea6bf3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7836676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v3TfjJy6RUsjRhGjZKh9cvYWTFB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/lQU0Z9b9ACleQqk2SB03VJu9NOS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159551,"name":"pink film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"??\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"日语\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
