However, his story is virtually unknown to much of the Western world. Filmed on location in India, Pakistan, and throughout the U.S., this documentary interweaves the story of Guru Nanak’s life with a look at how his spiritual legacy continues to influence prominent American Sikh men and women, including Mayor Ravi Bhalla of Hoboken, N.J., Grammy Award nominee Snatam Kaur, and others.","popularity":0.3703,"poster_path":"/5AlSDj8EClCr52wsXmw2zCII9EU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guru Nanak: The Founder of Sikhism - Life and Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Krell","original_name":"Gerald Krell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e86a7aa66e4690014a66aef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Krell","original_name":"Adam Krell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e86a7b63f7e1d001a5d2fe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jS2bGniDOz7J0P3RAaCrnQIFRdy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ofoTtATGdR7TAalS2CaBMMEsC5T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lzbuwUKu0iFJWMz3uF7EBBpiPj6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fqbMNXRrbCneE0fov4gn33Unhjx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4MMNVAN9sUhomosuzDuyNw2WZ80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5AlSDj8EClCr52wsXmw2zCII9EU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":759,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b6nPQtSycg81t4j5AOx4vq1Nv02.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":506},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n4YJw1fSLHAm9keiA0AbeT1FWfN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hlYqqw7VpagXgLuvYSyOxAKSHiI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":286746,"name":"sikhism"},{"id":320573,"name":"sikh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER - Guru Nanak: The Founder of Sikhism - Life & Legacy","key":"365114894","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-08T19:09:07.000Z","id":"5fe0baf73c887d003faee442"}]}}}
