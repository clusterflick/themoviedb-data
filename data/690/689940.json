Aspects of Burckhardt's work in photography, film, and painting are examined in interviews with Rudy Burckhardt, painter Yvonne Jacquette, and curators Robert Storr (former Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Brian Wallis (Chief Curator, International Center of Photography, New York).  In his studio in New York, Burckhardt discusses his photography and its significance within its historical framework. In the woods near his summer home in Maine, the viewer sees Burckhardt's easel and painting in front of the scene he is depicting.  Whether in city or country, Burckhardt appreciated and transformed the chaos he discovered.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/yGI0mQDllPhpQPvh1DcUpJOOhnQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Checkerboard Film Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rudy Burckhardt: Man in the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudy Burckhardt","original_name":"Rudy Burckhardt","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/i8sIbuaK3f667J0I0PhYpssdzb8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e89c59ed55c3d00155380dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Pollock","original_name":"Jackson Pollock","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/ikd3hTqkPuCXaqzcyKnGZMWPmjr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e89c5b06c74b9001397876f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355116,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alvin Curran","original_name":"Alvin Curran","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e89c614b84f940016cc0427","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Katz","original_name":"Vincent Katz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e89c5f2d207f3001698aef3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivien Bittencourt","original_name":"Vivien Bittencourt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e89c5c0cf1afd00116cd158","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Howard","original_name":"Edgar Howard","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e89c627cf1afd00116cd235","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henry Hills","original_name":"Henry Hills","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e89c60460b58d0018ecc430","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGI0mQDllPhpQPvh1DcUpJOOhnQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
