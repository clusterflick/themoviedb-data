These are very different people, the former walk very fast, the latter arrive, stay a moment and then leave. And it was the latter who interested me in particular. What do they do? Do they talk to each other? What do they say? My idea was to make a short film about that, showing five people who are very different from each other but who were all able to come and have a chat for a moment on a public bench.\" (Patrick Van Antwerpen)","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le banc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1935625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Van Antwerpen","original_name":"Patrick Van Antwerpen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e878d2066e4690014a81201","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
