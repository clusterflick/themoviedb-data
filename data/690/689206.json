Ann Liv appears as her brash alter ego Sherry, a therapist with a southern accent. During the performance, Sherry intends to auction a pan of her urine to the audience as a protest because she’s not permitted to sell her DVDs at the show. Instead, what ensues is theater so raw and challenging, the lights are killed to stop the show. I Don’t Exist If You Don’t weaves interviews with nine of Ann Liv Young’s performances, staged in Europe and the United States.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Don't Exist if You Don't","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5827762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
