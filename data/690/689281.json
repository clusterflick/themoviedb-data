Millions of people were sent to Paris and to the French back-country, a one-way trip which, according to Aimé Césaire, was close to deportation. The living conditions in the mainland were far different from what had been promised beforehand.  Jackie Bastide gives a voice to those who have lived through the Bumidom and had to suffer from a migration that was meant to be the road to a better life.","popularity":0.0676,"poster_path":"/kOPnjZLup7bdW8N5TnsHohz3b7z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal Overseas Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":131591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ Overseas","origin_country":""},{"id":92191,"logo_path":"/A0xS1XpxiOSyL22YKmXGIcgV1jf.png","name":"Temps noir","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bumidom, des Français venus d'Outre-mer","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133613,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jackie Bastide","original_name":"Jackie Bastide","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e872199af58cb0010e2d16b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yvan Gaillard","original_name":"Yvan Gaillard","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e872e19af58cb0010e2e8cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895744,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josie Miljevic","original_name":"Josie Miljevic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e872e2866e4690017a75e99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2018165,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matthieu Daude","original_name":"Matthieu Daude","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e872e099974ee0015b1521d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oUmqawlBK85bulaqPepe9GWHEqF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kOPnjZLup7bdW8N5TnsHohz3b7z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/moveE4YHzAXZ1HQOHMjEGi8wqXm.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uZl78r7BkIA9myi9bNmH7o6qdMk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 2","release_date":"2011-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
