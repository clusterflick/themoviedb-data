As some of the last of the still-living orphan train riders like to remind us, it was a different era - one that can't be judged without understanding what lives were like then. West by Orphan Train, a documentary film completed late in 2014, offers that understanding.","popularity":0.1809,"poster_path":"/gC9SrehU4rSqt33cYmOzXi2UIpu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West by Orphan Train","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4543530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gC9SrehU4rSqt33cYmOzXi2UIpu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
