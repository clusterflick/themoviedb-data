All these roles were played by a man from Ticino who spoke Locarnese dialect: Hannes Schmidhauser. North of the Gotthard people still believe he was Swiss German. In Ticino he is merely remembered for his career as a football player. So it is high time that this personality commited to culture and sports be presented in more detail.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/H6UBKo6VLVafG5xTaTbGFfLoAj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hannes 'Pussy' Schmidhauser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Tognola","original_name":"Victor Tognola","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e899b2b60b58d0015ecc1e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2614306","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/H6UBKo6VLVafG5xTaTbGFfLoAj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":701}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
