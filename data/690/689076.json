The old runways are crumbling. The only prizes are bragging rights and petty cash. The riders are from every walk of life, and from countries all over the globe. And yet Horace manages to hold everything together through love of the sport and force of personality.\r Thursday Fields is a portrait of a strikingly diverse subculture, and a window into New York Cityâ€™s melting pot in action.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pFtJyI1yyzVl01PZo8KOqRsY0a1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thursday Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pFtJyI1yyzVl01PZo8KOqRsY0a1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
