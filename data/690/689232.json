A provocative act that sparked a heated, still topical discussion around the question: what is art? Since then, that question has been asked time and time again. To the artist and to the viewer. If everything is possible and everything is allowed, how do you remember what art is? Director Ditteke Mensink spent two years at De Ateliers: the breeding ground for top talent in the visual arts. Her stay ended in a harsh confrontation with herself, the young artists and modern visual arts.","popularity":0.2665,"poster_path":"/unCHdZCY86rBFV8Tr049uG64J6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two years at the Ateliers","title":"The Confrontation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ditteke Mensink","original_name":"Ditteke Mensink","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e86e0d0af58cb0012e266f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/unCHdZCY86rBFV8Tr049uG64J6I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":587,"name":"amsterdam, netherlands"},{"id":8734,"name":"art school"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Dutch\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"nl\", \"native_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
