In another sequence, the same woman speaks on the phone, talking about the end of the world. In a third moment, a couple prepares breakfast in their apartment, with the same woman from the previous sequences embracing a baby. What will these three narrative moments have in common? What is the relationship between them? Everything and nothing. Is the answer in the woman’s emotional words on the phone? Or in her helpless expression when walking naked? Or in the happiness she seems to find in the domestic routine? Perhaps the charm is really not in trying to decipher, but in getting lost in this visual and impressionistic poem, this shake that slowly expands in our senses. Max Planck, one of the founders of the ancient quantum physics theory, said that energy has a discontinuous structure and can only exist under the form of fragments. These are the fragments that hide here an ethereal promise.","popularity":0.1298,"poster_path":"/jBcUlluea44QRrxSQALk3cXvE0f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16464,"logo_path":"/iH0ZuDfP4IcZidBx6F8gY17DQ5u.png","name":"Bando à Parte","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quantic Love","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1471454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Lucas","original_name":"Lucie Lucas","popularity":0.4161,"profile_path":"/q6OM0QpEMNiTCE0cVKaSFp1aY8v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"5e8615285aba320016e75639","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3219123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Melo","original_name":"João Melo","popularity":0.1027,"profile_path":"/tTapcciwK39BG7gu4isBbftnFfe.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"612fb440e38bd800601cdd52","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo Denis","original_name":"Milo Denis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"5e861542da10f00016eea313","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2340704,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernardo Bourbon","original_name":"Bernardo Bourbon","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jcXcnqgyVkavrst5Fw32axmLGKZ.jpg","credit_id":"62efada27d550400831f7df7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paulo Furtado","original_name":"Paulo Furtado","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/iA2L46DMPfp2DzBD1I2k2rFk9dG.jpg","credit_id":"5e8614a00c3ec800175ae033","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paulo Furtado","original_name":"Paulo Furtado","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/iA2L46DMPfp2DzBD1I2k2rFk9dG.jpg","credit_id":"5e8615655aba320018e7b2e3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201550,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Quintela","original_name":"Jorge Quintela","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g4VIZep8HhWTuiq7S1UWdgNWFow.jpg","credit_id":"5e861555691cd50018598792","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865220,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ricardo Preto","original_name":"Ricardo Preto","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e86156f691cd50014598da2","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paulo Furtado","original_name":"Paulo Furtado","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/iA2L46DMPfp2DzBD1I2k2rFk9dG.jpg","credit_id":"5e86157d691cd5001259ae05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Areias","original_name":"Rodrigo Areias","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/dwJYahw1irHhPTjrQMB4iZciSz9.jpg","credit_id":"5e86154d5294e700134b1581","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276860,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tomás Baltazar","original_name":"Tomás Baltazar","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e86155dda10f00016eea34e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7853598","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQmrtwlcosApZvhU1eJEPc1Jnem.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fgQkijNsn6Pn90fNc5qpd2qqvCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k8Rt0SzVs10CyaVrGgAWOMgBexm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.726,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jBcUlluea44QRrxSQALk3cXvE0f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":726}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Curtas Vila do Conde","release_date":"2019-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
