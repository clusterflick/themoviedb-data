Using a technique derived from the principals of the sound design technique called \"granular synthesis\" but applied to the rather fat grains of single video frames (visual content and sound), Granular-Synthesis manages to evoke from a few expressions on the face of the performer Akemi Takeya, a frenzied exploration of the alter ego within touching distance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hwAcWsauaP8dkTeD5D1utC9ccCE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Granular Synthesis: Modell 5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2394255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akemi Takeya","original_name":"Akemi Takeya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e8e16a5d236e60016e97992","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulf Langheinrich","original_name":"Ulf Langheinrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e894965d55c3d0017529303","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Hentschläger","original_name":"Kurt Hentschläger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e89495560b58d0013ebef19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hwAcWsauaP8dkTeD5D1utC9ccCE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
