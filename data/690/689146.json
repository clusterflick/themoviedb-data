Superb, even. And he knows it. The octogenarian tirelessly presses creases in pants and works his way through baskets of uniforms, using just a single washing machine and one dryer in his shop in a back street of Nice. He is becoming a rarity; all around him, the other laundries are closing down. But Jean-Fran√ßois is loyal to his clients, and they to him.","popularity":0.0499,"poster_path":"/rSrPnq42SwW2pMpcqeWQDJDbpkN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A French Laundry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabeth Vogler","original_name":"Elisabeth Vogler","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e86600de375c000143dd227","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4384940","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":911,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rSrPnq42SwW2pMpcqeWQDJDbpkN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":637}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
