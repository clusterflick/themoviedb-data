Beside their daily explorations, the teenagers restage scenes from the theater play Düşler Ülkesi (Land of Dreams). The premiere of the play in 1982 was overshadowed by a bomb threat. The contradiction in the film title of wanting to predict the past is a reference to the continuous experience of racism, but can also be read as a playful suggestion to break out of habitual patterns of thought and behavior—conveyed in the film through YouTube comments on Childish Gambino's song Redbone.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/8C7qlQ8R5DpheugsZTS5ZCe3GUQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Makes Me Want To Predict The Past","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cana Bilir-Meier","original_name":"Cana Bilir-Meier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e33e2cc43250f0015bf09ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525621,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nihan Devecioglu","original_name":"Nihan Devecioglu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e33e31743250f0017bf22ff","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1747302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lichun Tseng","original_name":"Lichun Tseng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e33e38c4ca67600144eab94","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cana Bilir-Meier","original_name":"Cana Bilir-Meier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e33e3c598f1f1001201d479","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liesa Kovacs","original_name":"Liesa Kovacs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e33e40bac8e6b0011c1c372","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525622,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zühal Bilir-Meier","original_name":"Zühal Bilir-Meier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e33e42aac8e6b0018c214a4","department":"Production","job":"Casting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17555522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8C7qlQ8R5DpheugsZTS5ZCe3GUQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
