It was shot on film (Kodak EXR 7248 as far as I remember) but only ever finished on DV. The sound is mono, recorded entirely where the footage was filmed, and entirely non-sync. There is one tiny audio dropout, where some oxide has dropped-off the now quite old master tape. The SuperSeaCat no longer runs between Newhaven end Dieppe, having been replaced by a much larger ferry, and parts of the land immediately behind the beach are now threatened with industrial development.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3XKAGMfruQRXR6ztKNhfzbCAJXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tidemills","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":152070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Collins","original_name":"Nick Collins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/e7P9hXgAzxihpQucodPiTqtzfVk.jpg","credit_id":"5e3267d4326c1900161f40b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3XKAGMfruQRXR6ztKNhfzbCAJXI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
