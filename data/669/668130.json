I have drawn on footage shot over the past 25 years - some appropriated from commercial resources, some hand-processed - an accumulation of textures which illuminate the film's fabric of memory. A wisteria arbor in bloom collapses under the weight of a late Spring rain, is rebuilt and repeats its cycle. In between occur an arson, flood, earthquake, planting and the harvest. Part 2 reflects on animals' roles in our lives as providers of food, companionship, clothing and sport. I observe the changes around me as I attempt to understand what it means to cultivate a sense of place in time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasonal Forces","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janis Crystal Lipzin","original_name":"Janis Crystal Lipzin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3268c1326c1900141fd782","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
