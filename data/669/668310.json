How is this major artist considered by society? Writers, journalists, linguists and students decipher the hidden face of the greatest French popular artist.

such.","popularity":0.2734,"poster_path":"/5EldMzTeGsDyQC3AoMzozxbwHAK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217719,"logo_path":"/ziNMdq9jGuEVrYc6vqfV4bgGBp.png","name":"LMNOP","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Argot
