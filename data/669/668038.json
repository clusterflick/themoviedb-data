The Alzheimer's disease and the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Creating an analogy between the two, we assemble a cinematographic journey through Don Genaros disturbed mind. Recollecting, relapsing and reviving his last memories we try to give the audience a hint of the whole background, and story about his life by creating the divergent freedom, a glimpse of interpretation of the world as the main character sees it.","popularity":0.1581,"poster_path":"/bSLUzNSTF2yplon53li9VxJgazM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2017-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
