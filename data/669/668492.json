Some fifty to sixty thousands were saved and transferred in France, often at pitiful conditions. This is for the first time, the story of this tragedy, told in the brilliant style of the authors of \"Apocalypse\".","popularity":0.525,"poster_path":"/iYcgA5Vo41nKKTkqXpx1FsWhZEZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24678,"logo_path":"/2XgHpNJsBm6jh4CVrgqpLQemXmU.png","name":"CC&C","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Unhealed Wound - The Harkis in the Algerian War","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saïd Taghmaoui","original_name":"Saïd Taghmaoui","popularity":1.1673,"profile_path":"/kuxI08YpwQFGweIXK7TELknwexr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6096989410dad6003d0ed961","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabelle Clarke","original_name":"Isabelle Clarke","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/rl5BEBpv6RilKlWnGdYM2MzK0ao.jpg","credit_id":"609698d410dad6003d0ed9d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Costelle","original_name":"Daniel Costelle","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/aTcWpu8uetTBosLZdzYdUz4781g.jpg","credit_id":"609698cb10dad6003c0dceca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207973,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis Vaudeville","original_name":"Louis Vaudeville","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2srD1mORzJ7rd76aBkcg0aXBExI.jpg","credit_id":"647ce8db0fb39800fb0c2526","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Costelle","original_name":"Daniel Costelle","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/aTcWpu8uetTBosLZdzYdUz4781g.jpg","credit_id":"5e34922dac8e6b0015c2a33a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabelle Clarke","original_name":"Isabelle Clarke","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/rl5BEBpv6RilKlWnGdYM2MzK0ao.jpg","credit_id":"5e34924598f1f1001202682d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1764433","wikidata_id":"Q3206700","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTrkSyJBMgot6UQTEj6otwXqIpE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vjoYr3k8lo1uo4wrbgOVYtVNL7B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":810,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iYcgA5Vo41nKKTkqXpx1FsWhZEZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":279977,"name":"french algeria"},{"id":298300,"name":"harkis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"France 3","release_date":"2010-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
