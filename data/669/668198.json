The reservoir, the life-giver and life-taker, connects these four characters who face loss, death, hope, and love. And they are ultimately swept away by unrelenting waves of change.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/oskLEn1lOzIVQk4lpkkhCnctokS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2014-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standing in Still Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2524802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ric Aw","original_name":"Ric Aw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e32e745326c19001420618c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"standinginstillwater","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":798,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFeNQ93zdinnv6G3afiNBpwuRyi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oskLEn1lOzIVQk4lpkkhCnctokS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":721}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Singapore International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"STANDING IN STILL WATER (溺) Trailer | SGIFF 2014","key":"pbD220glRio","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-12-04T23:16:26.000Z","id":"5e32e7f898f1f1001200bc7d"}]}}}
