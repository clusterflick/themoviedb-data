What the machine has produced are unstable fragments as the interim phase of a historical and personal process of solidification. Out of the chaos of existence, this UFO has emerged, twelve years later. During this period, cinema and music offered some footholds for a boy from the Italian provinces who had just finished secondary school and was open to life (which among other things regularly brought him to the Rotterdam and Berlin film festivals). The footage was shot (and edited) a long time ago now, back when the film still had a form fixed in advance – over the years, this has been lost.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/q7r8qQ3A23vRMhJtrz0ySYDsJvK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":215,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Non c'è nessuna Dark Side (atto uno 2007-2019)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Negro","original_name":"Erik Negro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e367a520c27100015713d2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Negro","original_name":"Erik Negro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4001989603310013ed2f94","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548438,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Elese","original_name":"Barbara Elese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e53671fa93d2500174c47f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548438,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Elese","original_name":"Barbara Elese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e53671af48b34001971e340","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Negro","original_name":"Erik Negro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e536728a76ac50015a5b104","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Negro","original_name":"Erik Negro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e536736f48b3400177235f2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q7r8qQ3A23vRMhJtrz0ySYDsJvK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
