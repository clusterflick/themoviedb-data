In a riot of local color, this film tells how, unlike many, Sam's dream comes true. A callow teenager, he talks the tough but consummate Horace Bixby into making him his apprentice on the \"Paul Jones,\" eventually following him to the much finer \"Aleck Scott.\" Meanwhile, he is already spinning fantastic yarns to everyone from awe-struck lads ashore, to fellow \"cub pilots\", to young lady passengers who catch his eye. Things temporarily take a turn for the worse when Bixby must attend a meeting and leave Sam to work under Brown, a dour tyrant with a grudge against him.","popularity":1.319,"poster_path":"/9oGYQ7fgATQsLkAgbsxKQMXREhP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life on the Mississippi","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lansing","original_name":"Robert Lansing","popularity":0.5903,"profile_path":"/h1ikQw9KaJ7QNT3WRiPsn4JtLK0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35abb743250f0019c13ccc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Knell","original_name":"David Knell","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/iRBgaZcPxCKuozeTIkrW7xEei6J.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35abc176eecf00178f4515","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Keane","original_name":"James Keane","popularity":0.3483,"profile_path":"/qGOuDCsYQ6IVfUr2P5K2pV6v9Ij.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35abd076eecf00178f4525","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Madden","original_name":"Donald Madden","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35abdb98f1f1001203b6da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pankow","original_name":"John Pankow","popularity":0.5029,"profile_path":"/cb4udknKU3v3nH0ej2NUzRJljXa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35abe74ca676001751ad22","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Holliday","original_name":"Bill Holliday","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35abf5ac8e6b0018c4100f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Reilly","original_name":"Luke Reilly","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/9CfRzLLFuo4l78XN1PaV1TpJA3r.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35ac01ac8e6b0018c4101c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":218798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcy Walker","original_name":"Marcy Walker","popularity":0.232,"profile_path":"/4xmc9kzuTcSNfHhGql4bnIrB1h6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35ac0c4ca676001751ad4e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Brady","original_name":"Don Brady","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35ac164ca6760012508941","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":75006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lawrence","original_name":"Jack Lawrence","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5e35ac2043250f0017c11d17","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip H.
