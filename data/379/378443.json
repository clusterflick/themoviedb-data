Blending archive, reconstruction, animation, 35mm rostrum, and observational photography, the film explores the transformation of these objects from clinical material to revered art objects examining the lives of the creators and the changing contexts in which the objects were produced and displayed.","popularity":0.0716,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fly Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abandoned Goods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick James","original_name":"Nick James","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"569f9fcf92514109580061a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iain Sinclair","original_name":"Iain Sinclair","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/itd7Mqaid9fsYnGZGCOhMpQdWWJ.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"voice","credit_id":"5c4052ad0e0a26386791d369","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Borg","original_name":"Pia Borg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569f9febc3a36858c600a918","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566115,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward Lawrenson","original_name":"Edward Lawrenson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569f9ffbc3a36858dc009c92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Borg","original_name":"Pia Borg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa006925141370b00248d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566115,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward Lawrenson","original_name":"Edward Lawrenson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa0119251415e5e009e61","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70525,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Ogborn","original_name":"Kate Ogborn","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa023c3a36858ce00a0a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Marie Russo","original_name":"Lisa Marie Russo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa0429251415e67009ddb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanna Sahloul","original_name":"Hanna Sahloul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa04f9251415e5e009e73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158296,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henning Christiansen","original_name":"Henning Christiansen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/es1vxI9VaPl3EdvZTzsdfpuWLvA.jpg","credit_id":"569fa0679251412ec700269d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Ciompi","original_name":"Philippe Ciompi","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa070c3a36858dc009ca4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95910,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nick Gordon Smith","original_name":"Nick Gordon Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa07d925141384900243f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Ciompi","original_name":"Philippe Ciompi","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa086c3a36858dc009ca8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566118,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andre Etienne","original_name":"Andre Etienne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa099c3a36858e500a784","department":"Production","job":"Production Accountant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Ciompi","original_name":"Philippe Ciompi","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569fa0a4c3a36858e500a788","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365392,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sam E.
