International superstar Anna Netrebko is Queen Anne Boleyn, trapped in an unhappy marriage to King Henry VIII (Ildar Abdrazakov) whose roving eye has settled on another womanâ€”Jane Seymour (Ekaterina Gubanova), Anna's friend, but now her unwitting rival. Add in Anna's early love, Percy (Stephen Costello), just returned to the court from exile, and the result is a haunting, explosive account of Queen Anna's tragic final days, before she goes to her execution in one of the most moving and dazzling final scenes in all of opera.","popularity":0.642,"poster_path":"/8ORVVY9pKHhzv4uLAsCYKxbv3iL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Anna Bolena","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Metropolitan Opera HD Live: Season 6, Episode 1 Donizetti: Anna Bolena","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Great Performances at the Met: Anna Bolena","type":"TV title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Met: Live in HD -
