The sheep are starving, but Jo Galloway (Charles Beetham) and his wife (Nan Taylor) battle on. Their son Gilbert (Rawdon Blandford) falls in with the wrong crowd while studying medicine in Sydney: conman Varsy Lyddleton (John Faulkner) and the seductress Olive Lorette (Marie La Varre). Gilbert forges his mother’s cheques to pay for Olive’s favours, ruining the family. A bank takes ‘friendly possession’ of Wallaby Station. Gilbert’s sister Marjorie (Trilby Clark) keeps her brother out of jail, but he becomes a tramp, after Lyddleton murders Olive and kills himself. Marjorie’s suitor Tom Wattleby (Dunstan Webb) saves Gilbert from a bushfire, just as the drought breaks, restoring the family’s fortunes. Marjorie and Tom can now wed, as the sheep and cattle fatten on rich pasture.","popularity":0.0845,"poster_path":"/tDtHQRnNtSQvbr0stXpkdDkf9IN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Wattle Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Breaking of the Drought","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Beetham","original_name":"Charles Beetham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jo Galloway","credit_id":"569d63dec3a36858c300421a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan Taylor","original_name":"Nan Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Galloway","credit_id":"569d64039251415e6a00425e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rawdon Blandford","original_name":"Rawdon Blandford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gilbert Galloway","credit_id":"569d6449c3a36858c800405f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trilby Clark","original_name":"Trilby Clark","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/w6BG7BkKjGG3kjlNio12I0gF1iH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marjorie Galloway","credit_id":"569d64719251415e73004098","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dunstan Webb","original_name":"Dunstan Webb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Wattleby","credit_id":"569d648b9251415e6d003e80","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Henry","original_name":"Ethel Henry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Molly Henderson","credit_id":"5a89ffcb9251417599069abc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1981077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie La Varre","original_name":"Marie La Varre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5BhcTrtT6Edx2jozvwZNEBIoRzo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Olive Lorette","credit_id":"5a89ffdb0e0a2654530731f0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Faulkner","original_name":"John Faulkner","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Varsy Lyddleton","credit_id":"66cb8643cee866a9488f4714","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franklyn Barrett","original_name":"Franklyn Barrett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569d63a4c3a36858c800404d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0011024","wikidata_id":"Q7719923","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tDtHQRnNtSQvbr0stXpkdDkf9IN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jDVWM78swwI4sLao7nfiQnIxvKq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
