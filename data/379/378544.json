Although they never see each other's faces, feelings of love grow between them as they read the holy book. Unable to contain his feelings for Nabat, Hafez breaks his vows as a holy man by composing a poem to her, and is thrown out of her father's house and forced to relinquish his title. Then Nabat is forced to marry another man. Will the two ever be able to meet again?","popularity":0.0768,"poster_path":"/8rT4mwsybDXQNt8VhUcdtPz3Yqt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4667,"logo_path":"/kW2HfJ2R3xBfXRW6jdevcSGavHT.png","name":"Bitters End","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":76970,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Film Milad","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hafez","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ハーフェズ ペルシャの詩","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumiko Aso","original_name":"麻生久美子","popularity":1.0692,"profile_path":"/pVOiHNMaIpue64dRg1GbXnSmMJK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nabat","credit_id":"56a026cdc3a36858ce00b6c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehdi Morady","original_name":"Mehdi Morady","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hafez","credit_id":"56a026ea9251415e5e00b34e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehdi Negahban","original_name":"Mehdi Negahban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Shamsadin","credit_id":"56a02711c3a36858dc00b2b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abolfazl Jalili","original_name":"Abolfazl Jalili","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/60A3cPn6ruYhZPx5o2wJsXO1Gqv.jpg","credit_id":"56a026b2c3a36858c300b222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abolfazl Jalili","original_name":"Abolfazl Jalili","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/60A3cPn6ruYhZPx5o2wJsXO1Gqv.jpg","credit_id":"573b8539c3a3683b2200004a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1125808","wikidata_id":"Q10843465","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iU5bkQTWUtChUXqI0Ihus5sPLrA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/8rT4mwsybDXQNt8VhUcdtPz3Yqt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qF7216LxSs14Uz0X0q2NjWLSDtJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":808}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
