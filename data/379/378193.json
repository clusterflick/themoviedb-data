Through interviews with herself, with her family - Ann Bierlich (mother), Asger Leth (brother), Jørgen Leth (stepfather), friends and people from the film industry it tells us about Stine's life from being a child actress to becoming a celebrated young star of the 80's.  The film is a comment on today's worshipping of stars, and how fame has almost become a drug in itself. It’s as if here’s every answer to any doubt.  But as Stine's story shows, reality can actually be the opposite.","popularity":0.3054,"poster_path":"/vVvqF0ZbFER18FmthoDbnPE88dh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babyfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Født til Filmen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stine Bierlich","original_name":"Stine Bierlich","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/sN0fvYsb4dBimWxvbIDR3Ohbk05.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"569d67c6c3a36858c60048f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ann Bierlich","original_name":"Ann Bierlich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"569e5635c3a36858ce006d74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Bang","original_name":"Simon Bang","popularity":0.0576,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"569d67ddc3a36858c80040cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","original_name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/qwPxGQ6IKuW7gt6JB034CKkHXtj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"569d686ec3a36858c600490f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jørgen Leth","original_name":"Jørgen Leth","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/nyegklYsfvx8RnMjRdX4DfMIPVC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"569d68809251415e6a00431d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asger Leth","original_name":"Asger Leth","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/6gDv3ofI8Kpq6enRrfROpqD14Wq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"569e5662c3a36858e5006faf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anders Refn","original_name":"Anders Refn","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/jjjGZVnJqAIYKn61APLJtqgyJwA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57d16b40c3a3684b3e007b1f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Wendel","original_name":"Linda Wendel","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/9uzVdAjYrWIehoYg0aGgg2UKr5v.jpg","credit_id":"569d67a1c3a36858d20040bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henrik Ipsen","original_name":"Henrik Ipsen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7b07affea0d70014c84661","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Wendel","original_name":"Linda Wendel","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/9uzVdAjYrWIehoYg0aGgg2UKr5v.jpg","credit_id":"5e7b07f7eec4f30016a92d39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Povl Kristian","original_name":"Povl Kristian","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tZg9RPapV1PBhniOk9KKaVQpUs3.jpg","credit_id":"5e7b07e963d71300168b099e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Wendel","original_name":"Linda Wendel","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/9uzVdAjYrWIehoYg0aGgg2UKr5v.jpg","credit_id":"5e7b0806fea0d70016c83c6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5151320","wikidata_id":"Q33535326","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rpoDfaEFAPV47WF9xIueTfWe61u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vVvqF0ZbFER18FmthoDbnPE88dh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
