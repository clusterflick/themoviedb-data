Streisand sings surrounded by animals in a circus dream sequence and wanders the Philadelphia Museum of Art in a moody eight-minute piece. Filmed in spectacular colour, this companion piece to her first special is one for the ages. The vibrant colours become a metaphor for imagination, inventiveness, fantasy, and sheer brilliance.","popularity":0.6296,"poster_path":"/dBxaLtuRxvtFWUWGO0Csao65wwL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1081,"logo_path":"/19kn4jVvpc3sAL3YpZNb3elhSMl.png","name":"CBS Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"It's a picture of me after being with you...\"","title":"Color Me Barbra","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbra Streisand","original_name":"Barbra Streisand","popularity":1.7698,"profile_path":"/6YD223jsdZX7VnWSjGjP1S7Xj6X.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"569e6bc29251415e6a006d4b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Erlichman","original_name":"Martin Erlichman","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/rhWKKguZ8piV8tkA1y6RdRoNDw3.jpg","credit_id":"5a70cfba925141374e015068","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Layton","original_name":"Joe Layton","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a70cfc9c3a36847ea0175a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967990,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Frederick Glaser","original_name":"Frederick Glaser","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a70d020c3a3684808018418","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Hairstylist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Layton","original_name":"Joe Layton","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a70cff992514137570148bf","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969770,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ray Diffen","original_name":"Ray Diffen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a70d0140e0a26796c0197bd","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19425,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Matz","original_name":"Peter Matz","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":"/o5BX1g8I4Ihjrn6moiTPegHGNZW.jpg","credit_id":"5a70d0080e0a26795c019928","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147705,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Willard Levitas","original_name":"Willard Levitas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a70cfe5c3a36847e401793c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dwight Hemion","original_name":"Dwight Hemion","popularity":0.2012,"profile_path":"/m4Iz1nbvYz1ruEbV6Wb7DMbMyaL.jpg","credit_id":"5ac7fa11c3a36834ce02f2e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dwight Hemion","original_name":"Dwight Hemion","popularity":0.2012,"profile_path":"/m4Iz1nbvYz1ruEbV6Wb7DMbMyaL.jpg","credit_id":"5ac7fa180e0a26496703466f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0243189","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":925,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j7z8UgI0j3jSSEi5Vy2abqZRMsL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1644},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8q8q2sZwrJTZOF0n2TVHQjbw1nv.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mQDkIB4BOZ57rzmuH1P3KYHQMky.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rsW3HplOExS9u3gNkUMlvPuSjiD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e5UVOqXlS9OpMhIZIq3RlvQv5WS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dBxaLtuRxvtFWUWGO0Csao65wwL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":872,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/16hJqSDWVwHwwfo611OgrEFTP31.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1966-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
