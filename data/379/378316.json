Rosie Koostachin delivers donations to families who live in uninsulated sheds, overgrown with toxic mold. She is determined to raise awareness, believing that if only Canadians knew, her hometown's dire situation would improve. Over five years, filmmaker Victoria Lean follows Attawapiskat's journey from obscurity and into the international spotlight twice - first when the Red Cross intervenes and again during the protest movement, Idle No More. Weaving together great distances, intimate scenes and archive images, the documentary chronicles the First Nation's fight for justice in the face of hardened indifference.","popularity":0.3024,"poster_path":"/j7gL4iNEcDaKYCDVHDk8UnBMQo3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Last River","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Lean","original_name":"Victoria Lean","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569e9ba7c3a36858c80070d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Lean","original_name":"Victoria Lean","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569e9bb3c3a36858e5007a22","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4166288","wikidata_id":"Q96371530","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j7gL4iNEcDaKYCDVHDk8UnBMQo3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3379,"name":"diamond mine"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":222192,"name":"attiwapiskat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
