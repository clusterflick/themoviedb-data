Among the gags: As Roland plays the harp, Rattfink tries to discourage him by drumming. When that fails, he inverts the drum to reveal a beehive; the bees attack, the harp strings send Roland back into a fountain, and the bee-stung Roland still presents Rattfink with a flower. Rattfink air-drops a bag of flour on Roland; the resulting cloud of flour engulfs RF's plane, and he crashes into a building. Finally, Roland is in a jam session; Rattfink paints a can of nitroglycerine to look like a drum, but slips on a banana peel and explodes. Roland puts a flower on his grave; Rattfink's ghost hurls it at Roland.","popularity":0.4179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hurts and Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lennie Weinrib","original_name":"Lennie Weinrib","popularity":0.295,"profile_path":"/x5hjpmpGyoTncVNVVig5Mu1gI1v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hippy","credit_id":"655c12ddb5400214d118ce50","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vocal effects","credit_id":"672a509d433c82ea267e7148","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John W.
