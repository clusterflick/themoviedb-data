Having lived through \"the golden age\" of cinema, Viktor dreams of bringing back the good old glory days, yet struggles to keep up with the new harsh reality. In a theater that lacks heating and is slowly falling apart, with no support from the State who owns the place, it’s almost a Don Quixote fight.","popularity":0.263,"poster_path":"/5nRQk6sfdPQmNaaMwsb0ph1TNkQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11191,"logo_path":"/jX214F9ausJmTAqVtv4L7WQ6rHR.png","name":"Libra
