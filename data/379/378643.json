Igor has been living in the Chernobyl Zone for almost ten years, for peace and a chance to escape modern civilization. Psychological issues, both personal and global, are still troubling him, and he embodies both harmonizing peace and supernatural stress. And an existential secret – the secret of the essence of life. He is surrounded by the elderly inhabitants of Chernobyl, living in villages entirely overcome by nature. They lead their unrealistic Atlantean lives, from which even war in Ukraine seems to be happening on another planet.","popularity":0.5711,"poster_path":"/sFyabyQuFqKvLVNGGdy0hdXoPiQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"56a14ece9251412ec7007c8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"5fc8d2ef3f8ede003d00ceee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297706,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gints Bērziņš","original_name":"Gints Bērziņš","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc8d3033f8ede003f00e1fa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566705,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Rudzāts","original_name":"Andrejs Rudzāts","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc8d316383df2003c56b961","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1700327,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aleksandrs Vaicahovskis","original_name":"Aleksandrs Vaicahovskis","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc8d32a426ae80042722f77","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andra Doršs","original_name":"Andra Doršs","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc8d33bb0040a004225394d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guntis Trekteris","original_name":"Guntis Trekteris","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc8d3508261ee00413ca064","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5246144","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFyabyQuFqKvLVNGGdy0hdXoPiQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210326,"name":"chernobyl"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Invisible City - Trailer","key":"110262582","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-10-28T15:22:06.000Z","id":"6010a875d55c3d003f750b66"}]}}}
