After losing badly to the Eagles, many of the players leave, and the team now has only eight players, one too few to play a game.  Going against his principles, the main character Harumaki Shunpei decides to buy a baseball robot. However, since he does not have enough money, he ends up buying the maid robot named Azusa. Even though Azusa has a warm heart and strong determination, it doesn't appear that she stands a chance against her adversaries who were top-of-the-line baseball robots. The team's only hope seems to lie in a secret buried within Azusa's clouded past.","popularity":1.6565,"poster_path":"/1FT824zOrt3nryje4z6ys985w9b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7164,"logo_path":"/vHsaqTkQ2ZTbdqrCA272YahoVlg.png","name":"TMS Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Azusa Will Help!","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Azusa, Otetsudai Shimasu!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Azusa, Otetsudaishimasu!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Azusa Will Help!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mamiko Noto","original_name":"能登麻美子","popularity":1.2163,"profile_path":"/wCSD7Umgzc66p8VGXrrMZtSLSuS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Azusa","credit_id":"578c93ff9251410864003993","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1652650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sayuri Anzu","original_name":"Sayuri Anzu","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/z07H3srQIYJrS5O2yDIjRjwM0BR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Super Azusa","credit_id":"578c9409c3a3687a4600f8fd","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1247625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuuki Tai","original_name":"泰勇気","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/g3nVgPI796fSPNHKZ4MsPoeUzh3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harumaki Shunpei","credit_id":"578c94169251413fa4007d92","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisuke Kishio","original_name":"岸尾だいすけ","popularity":0.7794,"profile_path":"/uXBSUBXWO87Kp3Dp4ILr2dp0nlU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hanashima Wataru","credit_id":"578c9421c3a3685acb00785f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fubito Yamano","original_name":"山野史人","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/vuv0yGkRfb7eErhbHto4237TVyl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Temple Reverend","credit_id":"578c942bc3a3685a980071ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroki Shimowada","original_name":"下和田ヒロキ","popularity":0.1905,"profile_path":"/1oQ9v1GdfBSValWNWgrQc1sPeNt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Tanabe","credit_id":"578c944cc3a3682bb200faa5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1652653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Shirokuma","original_name":"白熊寛嗣","popularity":0.2353,"profile_path":"/bzSNLbRYd4vd7EZqkcjRH5Z1byP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"578c9455c3a3685b44008356","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hajime Iijima","original_name":"飯島肇","popularity":0.3757,"profile_path":"/pJVsz7l83TKrMNG2wMa4W6cH62h.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Harada","credit_id":"57d2ae71c3a3685da9003267","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hajime Kamegaki","original_name":"亀垣一","popularity":0.3105,"profile_path":"/cpi1xEwGqCyOVM4eicfUIWJ8PMz.jpg","credit_id":"56a3ed44c3a36838a3003636","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1451486,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Noritomo Hattori","original_name":"Noritomo Hattori","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a3ed5ec3a368389000433c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hajime Kamegaki","original_name":"亀垣一","popularity":0.3105,"profile_path":"/cpi1xEwGqCyOVM4eicfUIWJ8PMz.jpg","credit_id":"56a3ed48c3a3683890004335","department":"Writing","job":"Storyboard"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567476,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Atsushi Soga","original_name":"曾我篤史","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a3ed539251411e150028c0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1652654,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yuuko Kawabe","original_name":"Yuuko Kawabe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578c9469c3a3682bb200fab1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13752178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1FT824zOrt3nryje4z6ys985w9b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9914,"name":"slice of life"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
