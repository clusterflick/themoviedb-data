The Blues Brothers were an unforgettable part of Saturday Night Live's golden era, making their musical debut in bee costumes singing \"I'm a King Bee,\" and becoming an overnight sensation. Switching to hats and shades inspired by John Lee Hooker, they combined classic Chicago Blues with Stax-Volt R&amp;B to create a sound all their own. Their first album, Briefcase Full of Blues, went double-platinum and led quickly to their hit movie and milestone soundtrack album. The rest is history, and it's all here in a music-filled, memory-blasting account of a band that will always be on a mission from God.","popularity":1.5645,"poster_path":"/yXPyufZj9lBW3kWmQ5UrQXp1zZr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1756,"logo_path":"/d7YyNzysIF0lSb4lJRf1ar6MHxi.png","name":"Broadway
