Premiere 1867. Then there are three versions of this opera, the French 1867 version, the revised Italian four Act Don Carlo 1884, plus the Modena version 1886. This version is the 1884 version with Act One reinstated, as well as the original beginning of Act 2. To complicate matters the French opera was simply translated into Italian, and then the changes were made. There is an even newer edition completed in 1980 by Ricordi, and others floating around as well.","popularity":0.3672,"poster_path":"/9htFQiA56mg6SSC45CrODxKz5mr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":280,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Verdi's Don Carlo at the Salzburg Opera Festival","title":"Verdi: Don Carlo","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Verdi · Don Carlo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matti Salminen","original_name":"Matti Salminen","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/85f1AMUU64wTADtLjQN4xLkM8cG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Filippo II","credit_id":"56a4b95b9251415216001bcc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Don Carlo","credit_id":"56a4b971c3a368388e0069f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":460831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hampson","original_name":"Thomas Hampson","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/6DGBYLORYO3uKvJrWUCV2rNswbh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rodrigo, Marchese di Posa","credit_id":"56a4b99792514144ba005f41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Harteros","original_name":"Anja Harteros","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/o2PNgibpNbj9Rt3hKVSdzIOqWp4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Elisabetta di Valois","credit_id":"56a4b9b19251410c080045da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Halfvarson","original_name":"Eric Halfvarson","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/2ftNCaJZWGd9n21rpKreTxXCcyz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Il Grande Inquisitore","credit_id":"56a4b9c8c3a368389000764c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1567668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Semenchuk","original_name":"Ekaterina Semenchuk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/z7rTjbrJTfAvCjtZeo5RUYhqagv.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"La Principessa Eboli","credit_id":"56a4b9e4c3a368389600684e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lloyd","original_name":"Robert Lloyd","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/39hqwFKidqj2K97pEmRMSjwzrzf.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Un Frate (Carlo V)","credit_id":"56a4ba4e925141524c001a92","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Celeng","original_name":"Maria Celeng","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Tebaldo","credit_id":"56a4ba8dc3a36838a3005e42","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sen Guo","original_name":"Sen Guo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Una voce dal cielo","credit_id":"56a4baa4925141524c001a9e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Bernheim","original_name":"Benjamin Bernheim","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Il Conte di Lerma / Un Araldo Reale","credit_id":"56a4babcc3a36838a3005e4d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Conductor -
