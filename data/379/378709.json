Aida is the role that inspired audiences around the world to acclaim her as the greatest Verdi soprano of her time. And this telecast shows why: the famous soaring phrases that seemed to never end, the shimmering top to her lustrous voice, undimmed by the years. But most of all, there is the ennobling heart and soul Price lavished on every performance—captured here forever. With James Levine conducting the Met orchestra, chorus, and ballet.","popularity":0.4386,"poster_path":"/sSdTfiTsu5uKtPBKgO39xXTl6j7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
