Martin wins his fight but is counted a loser by a crooked referee. Later, he is invited to a barbecue at Charlotte's home, but when John Hamilton, who strongly dislikes fighters, learns of Martin's profession, he shows him the door. Danny gives up his career for Charlotte and opens a health resort for obese millionaires. Hamilton and his prospective son-in-law, Penrod, arrive at the resort for treatment, and their indignation and disgust at the treatment provide comic complications. Learning that Danny and Charlotte have already eloped, Hamilton is at first furious, then resigns himself to their happiness.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/m0LLBI1GsnnyrNLu5BPo4VewRV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Father Said No","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"荒療治一手引受","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"O Papá Diz Que Não","type":"Portuguese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Brian","original_name":"Mary Brian","popularity":0.2336,"profile_path":"/av5uODnC03WTjzZn2Ca5dumQFcY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Charlotte Hamilton","credit_id":"6924ee2e744371e84ba74e6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny O'Shea","original_name":"Danny O'Shea","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Danny Martin","credit_id":"6924ee43a8eeb62a2cc11754","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Cooke","original_name":"Al Cooke","popularity":0.4953,"profile_path":"/iu2npqUJrM1EoowgumTiaijIKhm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Al Conklin","credit_id":"6924ee533999b7ac5330c55c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Guard","original_name":"Kit Guard","popularity":0.512,"profile_path":"/bFd7gdZlPlJYjVZ3t5rDrmh01dx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kit Goodwin","credit_id":"6924ee694a9cac5d21244c74","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Steppling","original_name":"John Steppling","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/3bmmaV4I0GfFNLkflGq8z00YMZR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Hamilton","credit_id":"6924ee80efce93e70526b627","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Darro","original_name":"Frankie Darro","popularity":0.5095,"profile_path":"/kTDMbr8WRWufs5fBKa8uDW0YMq7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Matt Doe","credit_id":"6924eeae1f4acf267f370d6b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Stone","original_name":"Gene Stone","popularity":0.1198,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herbert Penrod","credit_id":"6924eec2529ddef13426b659","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Caldwell","original_name":"Betty Caldwell","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Betty Francis","credit_id":"6924ef154779d992ddd9c1c4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5793241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sgt.
