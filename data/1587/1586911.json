The story follows Sulka, a lonely student desperately trying to fit into a charismatic friend group. Instead of acceptance, he becomes the target of escalating humiliation led by the group’s dominant figure, Matti.\r As moments of cruelty intensify—from quiet exclusion to disturbing acts of degradation—Sulka’s world begins to fracture. A misunderstanding pushes him past his breaking point, triggering a violent emotional collapse.\r In a final, chilling sequence, Sulka stands at the edge of an unthinkable decision, forced to confront the devastating impact of sustained cruelty.\r No One Sees is a stark and unsettling portrait of the silent suffering that can hide within school corridors—and the tragic cost of pushing someone too far.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"ACHTUNG!","title":"No One Sees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilda Kapanen","original_name":"Matilda Kapanen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sulka","credit_id":"6924c7bc1b7e0b75f405d4bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zakaria Maadidi","original_name":"Zakaria Maadidi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Matti","credit_id":"6924c7cf7239e842c9c40083","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yajun Wen","original_name":"Yajun Wen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Girl in the cafeteria","credit_id":"6924c808aaada8fd96b938bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valle Maila","original_name":"Valle Maila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The obscure man erasing text from the writing board","credit_id":"6924c8349d6bef62e8a674f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kauri Malme","original_name":"Kauri Malme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Additional actor 1","credit_id":"6924c85307a05dbd108d8f5c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeemi Jarva","original_name":"Jeemi Jarva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Additional actor 2","credit_id":"6924c866215b7e508b8d8f6a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valle Maila","original_name":"Valle Maila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924c87d971dc803838d8f8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zakaria Maadidi","original_name":"Zakaria Maadidi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924c8a15d73b757acae061e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valle Maila","original_name":"Valle Maila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924c8acb377c4d357a67449","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kukaan ei nää (ME1)","key":"Oh1XCs817p8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-11-21T09:50:47.000Z","id":"6924c8d9250fc3035144b1c0"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kukaan ei nää - Behind the scenes - dokumentti (ME1)","key":"ee2fpPmkyK0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2025-11-19T07:37:14.000Z","id":"6924c8f698e90e135d44b180"}]}}}
