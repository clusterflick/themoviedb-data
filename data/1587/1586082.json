In an interview, he recalled the homosexual games he witnessed and participated in at an orphanage. He illustrated episodes of his intimate story with images from the lives of a gay couple he met in Montreal. Warm, soothing shots of the two men contrast with the artist's words, delivered in a blunt, intimidating voice.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joseph's Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Józef Robakowski","original_name":"Józef Robakowski","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6922fd1ab6bc1c09c6958896","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
