Unable to find Lola, the professor and Rosetta move to New York, where she obtains employment as a stenographer to author Aubrey Hapgood. Rosetta captivates Aubrey and his friends, but Mildred Sanders, who had hoped to win Aubrey for herself, tries to ruin Rosetta's reputation. On a drive with Aubrey, Rosetta relates her life story, whereupon Aubrey, claiming he loves her, takes her to an inn. Although he promises to marry her, she later reads of his engagement to Mildred. Rosetta shoots herself, after which Lola appears to avenge her death by causing the ruin of Aubrey's sister. Aubrey fires on Lola, but Rosetta awakens in his car and realizes that it was all a dream. While the chauffeur repairs the car, she and Aubrey walk into town to find a preacher.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/kwcap4wVAkxskM7SXi7upf9eBdN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Select Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ordeal of Rosetta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Phantom Feud","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Brady","original_name":"Alice Brady","popularity":0.359,"profile_path":"/v9XVx9jV7ntUKog525jrYkSnq3n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosetta / Lola Gelardi","credit_id":"69242db7e162f2b6e1b74994","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crauford Kent","original_name":"Crauford Kent","popularity":0.1325,"profile_path":"/zYq9Z283YTCX5FYaG59nVs598TD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aubrey Hapgood","credit_id":"69242dd2cc0dbd61d5769052","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ormi Hawley","original_name":"Ormi Hawley","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/bmb2jThurXgi4Rdy8hFoaSUOKM6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Hapgood","credit_id":"69242de5247a321eefdd4eab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Leone","original_name":"Henry Leone","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Professor Gelardi","credit_id":"69242dffcffb5ec85b32abe0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1015322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maude Turner Gordon","original_name":"Maude Turner Gordon","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/dFThxJF3BSQ3Gi5p2tSjwcZC966.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Hapgood","credit_id":"69242e1a0259c538c932a9b8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3570614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Washburn","original_name":"Hazel Washburn","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mildred Sanders","credit_id":"69242e2f8e61fa0da1768f7d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Burns","original_name":"Edmund Burns","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/nm91OSyVUWeegGhh1yCuwkpj7a8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dick","credit_id":"69242e46d17f113730a3b655","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Henry","original_name":"George Henry","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Theatrical Agent","credit_id":"69242e5f10e0271861b74b1f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Émile Chautard","original_name":"Émile Chautard","popularity":0.2805,"profile_path":"/kl4uS46oKd46Nf0OpPps33If9tm.jpg","credit_id":"69242e7c10e0271861b74b23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edmund Goulding","original_name":"Edmund Goulding","popularity":0.3743,"profile_path":"/l4h95dSKe2CGNfSuAIRZn7mnwma.jpg","credit_id":"69242e8ce1e99d460c32aad0","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615486,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul West","original_name":"Paul West","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69242e9c5baf3fafeedd0043","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342273,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jacques Bizeul","original_name":"Jacques Bizeul","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69242eb01b39634d76958d6c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009455","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1418,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kwcap4wVAkxskM7SXi7upf9eBdN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":946}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1918-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
