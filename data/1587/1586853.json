A young worker is also with the passengers who are going to find work in Arab countries. Along the way, he becomes interested in the officer's daughter. The captain of the barge disembarks them on a deserted island. As the water rises, they find themselves facing death, and with great effort, they return to the barge and confront the captain and the workers. When a group of people from both sides starts to fight, they lose their lives. The officer's daughter and the young worker are the only people who survive this group. After a while, the two meet in a boat and, seeing the tricolor flag of Iran from afar, they realize that they are returning to their country.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kyoAkilt2dXQl2YwXzbvdqI0K9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1979-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corruptors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazem Afrandnia","original_name":"Kazem Afrandnia","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/L6jqeAnJcytFn3MgpH6pCBtViw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6924a74809e93317e8fab27a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassan Norahani","original_name":"Hassan Norahani","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6924a7518b6884b7948d8ed5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hossein Khanibeik","original_name":"Hossein Khanibeik","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/6NZTsnnAmbENsfq5D8jbZsAmubV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6924a75c52d5e76033ae059c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moharram Basim","original_name":"Moharram Basim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6924a76778fb32acdec3ffbb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1494089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamide Kheyrabadi","original_name":"Hamide Kheyrabadi","popularity":0.4675,"profile_path":"/55LOFtRFwvLqbEPmTkxqKq51Gml.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6924a7704f8d32b00dae0581","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aman Manteghi","original_name":"Aman Manteghi","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/qHRbmMOE5EPn82mRL4FvxDTSuX8.jpg","credit_id":"6924a7ad98973b27f5fab1d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1356,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyoAkilt2dXQl2YwXzbvdqI0K9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":902}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"1979-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
