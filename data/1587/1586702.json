They are home to rare plants, special animals, and enormous amounts of carbon. However, these unique ecosystems are now rarely found in Germany. For economic reasons, 95 percent of them have been drained, posing a massive threat to our climate. Drainage turns climate protectors into climate killers, emitting huge amounts of carbon dioxide every year. In this film, researchers, farmers, and politicians have their say.
