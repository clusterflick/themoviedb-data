An elderly fisherman rows out across the lake to check on his fishing nets. It's the same trip he's made every morning for most of his life. But other things have changed. The famous pelicans and cormorants are not staying here in the same numbers anymore. And the fisherman's nets now only catch algae. The future for the lake and all the lives that depend on it are highly uncertain.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/c9TRx5gl95mRxA4mWvtWEEmreCz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apolo Media","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake of Apples","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kole Vasilevski","original_name":"Kole Vasilevski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69244ea3f9584fbc7c1874cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frosina Georgievska","original_name":"Frosina Georgievska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"69244eb54cc6839430b74b4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoran Spirkovski","original_name":"Zoran Spirkovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69244ec90259c538c932aa3b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slavčo Georgievski","original_name":"Slavčo Georgievski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69244edd4b061ef3b432ac06","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miše Petkovski","original_name":"Miše Petkovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69244ef0897cbf19c80bab70","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Manev","original_name":"Martin Manev","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator in Macedonian","credit_id":"692441cb6eec4b27dc32accb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2187555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Kotevska","original_name":"Tamara Kotevska","popularity":0.4319,"profile_path":"/uDOqIbU0F9ogDa8IhJe0vfSBDvh.jpg","credit_id":"692441db4cc6839430b74b09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2187554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ljubomir Stefanov","original_name":"Ljubomir Stefanov","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/x7FiZl69gfUXDmNApY4LrX8NXnd.jpg","credit_id":"692441f1c9d20c6977768fd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Atanas Georgiev","original_name":"Atanas Georgiev","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/37TGQi5qUKP4W55xk6tZhxAHLcX.jpg","credit_id":"692447bae94ca9bba7dd4eaa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464301,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fejmi Daut","original_name":"Fejmi Daut","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692447c5cffb5ec85b32ac80","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samir Ljuma","original_name":"Samir Ljuma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692447d8289e1ba7621874f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2187555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Kotevska","original_name":"Tamara Kotevska","popularity":0.4319,"profile_path":"/uDOqIbU0F9ogDa8IhJe0vfSBDvh.jpg","credit_id":"69244a11b2952ee1cbdcff26","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836252,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ognen Čemerski","original_name":"Ognen Čemerski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69244a2d6909488767768f7e","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Foltin","original_name":"Foltin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69244c5535070d59c71877c3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11935262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9TRx5gl95mRxA4mWvtWEEmreCz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lake of Apples -
