It was footage from an arranged situation: an unrestrained party shared by members of the eponymous group and artists associated with the Pitch-In Culture group. Robakowski and Krymarys filmed their walk through the city, which ended with a party at The Loft, an important informal meeting place on the map of avant-garde Łódź. Actions carried out in the streets, in the Balaton Bar and at The Loft were intended to form the visual element for a music video that was to accompany a popular song celebrating the working-class Łódź. A year later, Robakowski reinterpreted the video: he re-edited the recorded material, slowed it down, changed the colours, and chose Witold Lutosławski’s Symphony No. 3 as background music.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Party with Lutoslawski","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Józef Robakowski","original_name":"Józef Robakowski","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692308da6909488767768a8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
