Arriving initially on loan from Glasgow Rangers in 1994 he very quickly became an Evertonian idol. His robust, brave, yet undoubtedly skilful style endeared him to the supporters and a towering header that found the net against Liverpool just after his arrival rubber-stamped his reputation. BIG DUNC tells the whole amazing story of how a gangly youth from the Scottish town of Stirling became one of the most feared and iconic centre-forwards in the Premier League. This Official Everton DVD covers Ferguson s career from schoolboy football, through Dundee United, Glasgow Rangers, his two spells at Goodison, a stay at Newcastle United and an all-too brief international career with Scotland. But, as with most comic-book heroes, there are ups and downs in equal measure. The goals and the glory, the injuries and the red cards, the brushes with the law, the burglaries and the pigeons.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qmjFWBT5oRTPsqNRGSxktzVSXjz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121666,"logo_path":null,"name":"ILC Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Official Everton DVD","title":"Big Dunc: The Story of a Goodison Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan Ferguson","original_name":"Duncan Ferguson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924b9c28570ecc52cae063c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1213624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ally McCoist","original_name":"Ally McCoist","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/zp837INdHQUFGhytgvgQo7UJK0Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924ba23afe6042d8644b145","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Smith","original_name":"Walter Smith","popularity":0.3308,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924ba330923601b89a673f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Shearer","original_name":"Alan Shearer","popularity":0.2259,"profile_path":"/fZVWSY6ADD7iNSfvEEdFWki3eYj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924ba41107228725b8d8f3b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2580082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikel Arteta","original_name":"Mikel Arteta","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924ba63934ba1e23a05d441","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Collymore","original_name":"Stan Collymore","popularity":0.2523,"profile_path":"/tmbRnnPexT8qEUiaY9Xth0yJbV1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924baa31ed4f3f76ab93860","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hateley","original_name":"Mark Hateley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924baaf7239e842c9c4004a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Durrant","original_name":"Ian Durrant","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb26a0b9d1c41f9dbff5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Carragher","original_name":"Jamie Carragher","popularity":0.4027,"profile_path":"/fkZvEPSltV3OpR6ODsVwCiDDzHR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb392c7c50254705d426","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Durie","original_name":"Gordon Durie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb46eddd2983a28d8f71","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gough","original_name":"Richard Gough","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb5c80230d5cde44b15a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Bullard","original_name":"Jimmy Bullard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8P9i8ZAT7ZQVJCh3zXd8nWkyZGL.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb709ac2cb9a15b938b5","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2033524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Ince","original_name":"Paul Ince","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/imYxWiokoz1oT0H6NCkt8fC2Y11.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb8307a31e83dab9386b","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Hendry","original_name":"Colin Hendry","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6924bb9100f997767705d429","order":13}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1062,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qmjFWBT5oRTPsqNRGSxktzVSXjz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
