Hosted and narrated by actor Horace McMahon, it was filmed during the winter of 1964 at the now abandoned stadium. The film looked back at its history from its opening in the 19th century, to its glory years as the home of the New York Giants baseball team and its final two years as the home of the amazing (and not in good way) New York Mets - as well as other famous events that took place there, such as football contests and boxing matches.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wcXRbUb4ABPq7hWSwarY4tl86UM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97047,"logo_path":null,"name":"Howard Cosell
