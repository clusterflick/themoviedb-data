What initially appears to be a classic documentary about his life and work increasingly defies clear categorization. Interstitial spaces open up—places that are neither entirely past nor present. In these liminal spaces, a lonely architect transforms a cultural wasteland into a cinematic space full of transitions, allusions, and visions.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/Ae5USthjnNXzFiPDnepQhYXKPIM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Hajeck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5836463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Jaskorski","original_name":"Eric Jaskorski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924675c5565466cbf0bab8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":762,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ae5USthjnNXzFiPDnepQhYXKPIM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
