The film overflows with a vivid sensitivity characteristic of a female director. The French title means something like “Look at the end.” (It seems that there is a typographical error in the actual title.)\r The original film print does not have a magnetic sound track, so it is likely that the audio was played from a cassette tape in sync during screenings. Unfortunately, the audio tape has been lost, and it is now impossible to know what lines the characters were speaking in the film.\r The condition of the film itself is relatively good, and it appears it has rarely been screened since it was made, but it strongly conveys the atmosphere of the late 1970s. It would be a real shame not to watch it solely because it is now silent.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regardez jusgu'd la fin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1270,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWUFn5s33i7NMnckZ4pIspl6RTj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":847}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
