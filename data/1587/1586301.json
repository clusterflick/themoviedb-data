Yavar and his student Ali (Mehdi Fakhimzadeh) take Karim to their hometown of Shiraz. Karim accidentally kills a passerby, and Yavar introduces himself to the police instead of Karim. While Yavar is in prison, Karim insults Yavar's sister, Nosrat (Aram), and at the same moment, Qoli Palang (Ahmad Moeini) rapes his own sister. Karim flees to Tehran and, after learning what happened to Maryam, decides to kill her; but his mother stops him. In Tehran, Nosrat meets a singer (Nadia) and takes refuge in her house. Some time later, Yavar is released and looks for Karim. Karim escapes from him and Ali and gets into a fight with a leopard in a ruin outside the city. Eventually, both are injured, and Karim expresses remorse in Yavar's arms before dying. Ali asks Yavar for permission to marry Nusrat.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vvXBNQ7heh2zLrNVB6P51kMYby6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1974-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yavar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reza Beyk Imanverdi","original_name":"Reza Beyk Imanverdi","popularity":0.2624,"profile_path":"/tOI7f1ge1wEaDe3hi0AXwcS8Xa2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d024230ab25410ba790","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2091787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aram","original_name":"Aram","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/p2DZLctRcy9rBshTLuKcBCTWupu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d0b3a3a2790aab7477b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hosein Gil","original_name":"Hosein Gil","popularity":0.1558,"profile_path":"/a7yOUkir8A7ASPDsrk5ddv2aQlg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d1566214e55250ba819","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2360243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tahere Ghaffari","original_name":"Tahere Ghaffari","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/3gd2fszxGJvdboaczHPQZGO32xO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d1f549e857d2632a97c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2327122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Moeeni","original_name":"Ahmad Moeeni","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/vnK2ID67dizWktrdJxoGNpmmGoy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d28f10ffdd9d2187311","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2584234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia","original_name":"Nadia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wnSP1Xd3ZfDRA8JdplVW5kY3EMZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d36f10ffdd9d2187314","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parvin Soleymani","original_name":"Parvin Solaymani","popularity":0.2285,"profile_path":"/vSd0xcNspeP7RpWVPhvfGIHW7rt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d4438783e5ae9a3b654","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1812922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehdi Fakhimzadeh","original_name":"مهدی فخیم‌زاده","popularity":0.4679,"profile_path":"/wEieluwfJ0rYigYcXguLW4PkGuV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"69236d4ef10ffdd9d2187317","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2324476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbas Kasayi","original_name":"Abbas Kasayi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69236d625797c3f0f1dd4be0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1352,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vvXBNQ7heh2zLrNVB6P51kMYby6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":904}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"1974-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
