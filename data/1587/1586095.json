Fast, accurate and unbeatable, he mastered the art of resistance in the ring. But outside it, the real fight was always against an invisible pain: having had a loveless childhood. He grew up losing rounds against silence, loneliness and abandonment. During his teens he turned his rage into muscle, fear into determination, and pain into sacrifice. He became strong. The legend survived. Today, in the twilight of his life, this old champion is facing an unexpected fight.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kid Vereje","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759353,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Sánchez-Gijón","original_name":"Ana Sánchez-Gijón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6923061ce47e0655870ba4d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
