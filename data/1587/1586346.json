The Broca’s Area in the brain is involved primarily in speech production. During a traumatic event or when trying to recall a traumatic event, this area shuts down. This makes it harder for a survivor to talk about what’s happened. Our project is an experimental documentary hybrid that offers a platform for survivors to tell their stories both verbally and non-verbally.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/pFml6QmrbqDtj06EKQS4awp41Kk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":283,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broca","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4082981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tarneem
