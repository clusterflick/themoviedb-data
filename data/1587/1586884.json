In this experimental piece, Shimabuku enlists Brazilian street singers, or Repentistas, to reinterpret and perform narratives inspired by his earlier “octopus” projects. Through a dialogue between visual documentation of his encounters with octopuses and the spontaneous, improvised oral storytelling of the Repentistas, the work explores cross-cultural collaboration, narrative translation, and the poetic intersections between human and non-human life. The result is a playful, immersive meditation on memory, mythology, and the act of storytelling itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wxpS5miVuDJSV3Oie0dhVCXLOK0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asking the Repentistas – Peneira & Sonhador – to remix my octopus works","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4663934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shimabuku","original_name":"Shimabuku","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924bc15c283311a66b938cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxpS5miVuDJSV3Oie0dhVCXLOK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
