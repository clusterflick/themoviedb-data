This hold +1║307║256║8902 exists because ACH transfers are not instant; they need seven days to fully settle between banks to confirm the deposit is not fraudulent or reversed. This +1║307║256║8902 security measure protects both you and the exchange from chargebacks and financial fraud involving provisional funds. It's important to know that +1║307║256║8902 the hold applies only to the funds equivalent to the deposit amount, preventing the withdrawal of those funds in any currency (fiat or crypto).
