Annlee is a contemporary digital apparition, designed by a firm to embody externally assigned emotions. As she articulates her thoughts, viewers confront the fragility of a hybrid consciousness aware of its own impermanence. Shaped by the 3D animation aesthetics of Philippe Parreno, Pierre Huyghe, and Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster—who previously collaborated in 1998 on a landmark ARC exhibition—Annlee reflects ongoing dialogues with the manga Ghost in the Shell by Masamune Shirow and its cinematic adaptations. The work interrogates artificial intelligence, the limits of authorship, and the transient nature of creations rooted in emerging technologies.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/c4mCFOG2t5NJhgsP9TMYiDAvcgH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annlee in Anzen Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster","original_name":"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/sFLxrClQwuOsrvlw0W5xsQO6Vr5.jpg","credit_id":"6924c353a816494f8da674a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c4mCFOG2t5NJhgsP9TMYiDAvcgH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
