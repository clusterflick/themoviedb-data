In 1997, she is assigned to solve the murder of a Navy SEAL's family, and to locate his teenage daughter, who has disappeared. Moss discovers that the missing SEAL was an astronaut aboard the spaceship U.S.S. Libra--a ship assumed lost to the darkest currents of Deep Time. Moss knows first-hand the mental trauma of time-travel and believes the SEAL's experience with the future has triggered this violence.  Determined to find the missing girl and driven by a troubling connection from her own past, Moss travels ahead in time to explore possible versions of the future, seeking evidence or insight that will crack the present-day case. To her horror, the future reveals that it's not only the fate of a family that hinges on her work, for what she witnesses rising over time's horizon and hurtling toward the present is the Terminus: the terrifying and cataclysmic end of humanity itself.","popularity":0.3832,"poster_path":"/vQQXLf116c2NvNNMrU74wmhwQlK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"The Gone World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neill Blomkamp","original_name":"Neill Blomkamp","popularity":0.6131,"profile_path":"/yj40QEEfjbRFnlwY0XunocNKdAe.jpg","credit_id":"578a379e92514163e800331d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651530,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Sweterlitsch","original_name":"Thomas Sweterlitsch","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578a37afc3a36841e3002fa7","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5216088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1731,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vQQXLf116c2NvNNMrU74wmhwQlK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1154}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":207694,"name":"procedural"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
