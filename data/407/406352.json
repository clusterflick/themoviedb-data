He then displays several offenders that have recently been brought in. Shoelaces, for example, have an objectionable habit of breaking at crucial moments. The officer proceeds to call attention to window shades, bedroom slippers, and other menaces. He also answers his critics who advocate reasoning with these objects rather than punishing them.","popularity":0.0915,"poster_path":"/fzQUBGLvRVv4HdsPdsrrXbgpUTM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crime Control","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sgt.
