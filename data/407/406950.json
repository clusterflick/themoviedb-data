Several times Jack Hardy almost reaches the proposal point with Marion Van Sickles, but each time the fates are against him. Marion and her mother are on their way home from a vacation in Europe and board the boat at Liverpool at the same time as Jack, who is very much struck by Marion's appearance. After a little flirtation on the boat, he believes that his feelings are returned and is about to propose. Just then mama comes along with Count Brainlesse, whom she wishes to marry Marion. The proposal is postponed. Again and again Jack tries to come to the point, being constantly interrupted by someone, either the count or mama, or the grouchy owner of the deck chair he has taken. First the grouch, then mama, and then the count, get sea-sick and at last Jack has Marion alone. Alas, the time has not yet come.","popularity":0.2286,"poster_path":"/hVlZLctfuUS7uMXLVnTxEcM6iJi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delayed Proposals","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Hardy","credit_id":"578b9a91c3a3685b44000ef8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Kimball Young","original_name":"Clara Kimball Young","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/zMsyHsgLM1XuZyQlYPVeepATc5o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marion Van Sicklen","credit_id":"578b9aa2c3a3685a60000d97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Young","original_name":"James Young","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/hUrgUlp8rBfn0WSKQcX6yzAEfym.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Count Brainless","credit_id":"578b9ab4c3a3685b44000f03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.
