Cycles are left incomplete. Chases are never consummated; the day ends with no promise of rebirth. In this way the film touches on our oldest instincts, leaving us saddened and scared by the knowledge of a world that will never know freedom through the completion of action; safety through the sanctification of place.","popularity":0.2561,"poster_path":"/5Ofjf1Is2lra7eOL1TlSxBpjpMk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introduction to Oobieland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Oobieland I","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578b99399251417b68008798","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3257338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5Ofjf1Is2lra7eOL1TlSxBpjpMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":323307,"name":"experiemental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
