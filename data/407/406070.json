As Álfgrímur begins to encounter the minor politicians, businessmen and social-climbers of the growing town of Reykjavík he starts to question his future as a fisherman's grandson, and is increasingly fascinated by Garðar Hólm, the celebrated Icelandic \"world singer\" whose sporadic returns to Iceland encourage Álfgrímur to pursue his own personal goals of self-expression. He discovers the true value of his boyhood experiences only as he sets out on a path that will take him away from them forever.","popularity":0.1317,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17496,"logo_path":"/o024AfoFk05dTk3Kz6BNTbkAwT.png","name":"RÚV","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":9138,"logo_path":"/k7txH8XTs9BZwmTK6Drhjvt2ipu.png","name":"Sveriges Radio","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1973-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fish Can Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Fish Can Sing","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Árni Árnason","original_name":"Árni Árnason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Álfgrímur (Age 17)","credit_id":"5949d665c3a368613c002d6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1825224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Þorsteinn Ö.
