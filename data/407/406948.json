The dual-threat playmaker was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft, set numerous quarterback rushing records, made four Pro Bowls and amassed a fortune playing football.  Then it all disappeared. A dog-fighting scandal sent him from the gridiron to prison.  From that point on, it was up to Vick to redeem himself.  Vick has encountered plenty of highs and lows throughout his career. Now, as his NFL tenure winds down, the 36-year-old quarterback is looking back and opening up about his up-and-down past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"VICK An Exclusive Bleacher Report Documentary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
