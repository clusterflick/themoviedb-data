During spring, the village is soaked in flood. It’s Easter Eve. The villagers are gathering for a strange old ritual in order to watch over The Crucified until the dawn. However, the stillness is being shaken by performers/villagers who are trying to steal The Crucified, as well as a nearby factory noises that remind of space rocket take off site.  The film is based on a strange old pagan tradition, which is still preserved only in one village in Samogitia (a part of Lithuania). The tradition goes back to the archaic space of the magic’s of folk theater.","popularity":0.0749,"poster_path":"/wh9f56EqQcuQiSmLfwFUgSe8SOl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Unfinished Tales of Jerusalem","title":"From Unfinished Tales of Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arūnas Matelis","original_name":"Arūnas Matelis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/oIZZkntuWV2YhAWOW1XAUFUxEfF.jpg","credit_id":"57863cbfc3a3680bec005bf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0415072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wh9f56EqQcuQiSmLfwFUgSe8SOl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
