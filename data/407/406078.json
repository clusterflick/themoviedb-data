With power and nuance, Ellerson also confronts the thorny question of cultural authenticity by revisiting the legendary 1991 FESPACO (Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television of Ouagadougou), in which diasporian women were asked to leave a meeting intended for African woman only. This film is both a valuable anthology and a fitting homage to the pioneers and new talents of African cinema.","popularity":0.2036,"poster_path":"/aJbq0HDX2h3QClHCoTgdRqdEqOy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisters of the Screen - African Women in the Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Safi Faye","original_name":"Safi Faye","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/xwxoVwvhmIwlGNVgHXEoIoo5yK9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"578573e3c3a36857d90077ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Maldoror","original_name":"Sarah Maldoror","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/7w5MRfYaCoGxS1zYx0QpCd2u0Iz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"578573eac3a36857d90077af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1467441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mbissine Thérèse Diop","original_name":"Mbissine Thérèse Diop","popularity":0.1385,"profile_path":"/brqQWUcMCScThyhQefLyUubeb23.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"578573f1c3a3684ef7008928","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1328280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ngozi Onwurah","original_name":"Ngozi Onwurah","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/tn4GRvjF21cbtJwmH4pRa2w5pXI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"578573fd925141021e001e73","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1649385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beti Ellerson","original_name":"Beti Ellerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fK5mYxi8zzN8ZCaV2iHldlDPy8G.jpg","credit_id":"5785740792514101be001f51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12666216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJbq0HDX2h3QClHCoTgdRqdEqOy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
