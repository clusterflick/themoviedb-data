Filmmaker Lucian Busse, an active protagonist of the period, documents the transformation of Berlin after the Wall. But Berlinized represents more than just the 1990s - it is a metaphor for this virally catching creative feeling, the slightly rough directness, spiced up with a big dash of typical Berlin humor. Berlinized lets the former protagonists reflect how that temporary feeling of freedom shaped their individual lives, and to what degree that freedom can still be found among the neat order of today's Berlin. These reflections are as diverse as the interviewees and as multifaceted as the changes in those times.","popularity":0.4168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlinized","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Busse","original_name":"Lucien Busse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57856e8f925141047e004ab6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Busse","original_name":"Lucien Busse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57856e819251413817006e6e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Busse","original_name":"Lucien Busse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57856e4092514104bb004ed0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Busse","original_name":"Lucien Busse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57856e9a925141021e001cbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1666572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":1353,"name":"underground"},{"id":18677,"name":"alternative"},{"id":227403,"name":"mitte"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Berlinized | Trailer ᴴᴰ","key":"iZvizDZzQa4","published_at":"2014-08-22T10:15:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"57856f98925141047e004b0e"}]}}}
