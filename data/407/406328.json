They include several of Freud's friends and daughters, and the film becomes a depiction not only of his art, but also his private persona. Lucian Freud does not appear, with the exception of a brief shot at the end of the film.","popularity":0.1393,"poster_path":"/vm18zRY5VuPV0ZZ5eMoIYiRBLSN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucian Freud: Portraits","video":true,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucian Freud","original_name":"Lucian Freud","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5eacfa5d0c3ec80025cb298e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Auerbach","original_name":"Jake Auerbach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eacfaea0b731600243db336","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0438170","wikidata_id":"Q3427533","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1011,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vm18zRY5VuPV0ZZ5eMoIYiRBLSN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uEYR3TJFFbw00lq2Anxv7vZT6uI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL TRAILER | Lucian Freud: A Self Portrait (2020)","key":"jWwpVmgvFog","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-09-23T13:24:26.000Z","id":"5eacfa160c3ec8001fcb2cb9"}]}}}
