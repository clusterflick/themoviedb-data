Racism, transnational discourses, queer politics and appropriation art are also being investigated throughout the video-essay.\r Off-white Tulips is conceived as a fictional dialogue with James Baldwin that focuses on his prolonged stay in Istanbul. Found documents and re-signified objects are manipulated to layer Baldwin’s identity as a black gay author with the narrator’s personal history. The associative narrative extends with references to Turkish and American pop-icons, investigations into etymology and self-reflexive comments on visual representation towards a situated critique of racism.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/ErJvGw4NA9pd9lSu67AQjNj07o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Off-White Tulips","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aykan Safoglu","original_name":"Aykan Safoglu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57875f589251413761004443","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2841786","wikidata_id":"Q16832688","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49GJ5SGguEJVRf4GHEve5n2Ii7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ErJvGw4NA9pd9lSu67AQjNj07o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":259285,"name":"gay artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
