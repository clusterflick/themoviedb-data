Set in Roman times, the play deals with the bloody revenge of  Roman general Titus Andronicus for the atrocities committed against his  family by Tamora, the captive queen of the Goths, and her faction.  Grotesquely violent and daringly experimental, Titus was the smash hit of Shakespeare's early career, and is written with a ghoulish energy he was never to repeat elsewhere.","popularity":0.8644,"poster_path":"/kfaFQEeeibOuOWt5QfYy1KSXnEO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare's Globe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Titus Andronicus - Live at Shakespeare's Globe","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Titus Andronicus: Shakespeare's Globe on Screen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Houston","original_name":"William Houston","popularity":0.8214,"profile_path":"/4J4TG1dbyJcSs78hP9fU2x8jrJs.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Titus Anronicus","credit_id":"57994d519251412345003c58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indira Varma","original_name":"Indira Varma","popularity":1.8148,"profile_path":"/8oH9Mk6OjdhCpDIfAKNyleqlZ18.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tamora","credit_id":"57994d5d92514101e1004e98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1459245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Obi Abili","original_name":"Obi Abili","popularity":0.245,"profile_path":"/s53vGPEyzaCZgKKrVNpynG6h9Iz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"57994d6f925141230e003f76","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Spencer-Longhurst","original_name":"Flora Spencer-Longhurst","popularity":0.2002,"profile_path":"/3Hv3N1y8uUaefMagHAf0C7pRmDG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lavinia","credit_id":"57994d8ec3a36874e9007d52","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":969950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dyfan Dwyfor","original_name":"Dyfan Dwyfor","popularity":0.1756,"profile_path":"/2s0b5zGIUVOQ3zgZ3CuJ7IASnii.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lucius","credit_id":"5b71d1a00e0a267ee71a97b4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Needham","original_name":"Matthew Needham","popularity":0.2784,"profile_path":"/puXRmhcYtSQsaVndbX2BYS7UFxl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Saturninus","credit_id":"5b71d1b2925141405616373c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1459247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Edward-Cook","original_name":"Samuel Edward-Cook","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Demetrius","credit_id":"57994d819251412345003c63","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Martin","original_name":"Brian Martin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ej5IRTqihxazeQI00h1OPK7ssV7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chiron","credit_id":"67f81a9231775276d6d9b39d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1006822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Bailey","original_name":"Lucy Bailey","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57994db192514141a300a344","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"6453d684c0442900e2f17f61","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5111634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kfaFQEeeibOuOWt5QfYy1KSXnEO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qNU9Uv3XkTMhOyytfakuSXneqPn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10614,"name":"tragedy"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Titus Andronicus: Behind the Scenes | Shakespeare's Globe | Rent or Buy on Globe Player","key":"A8rXDKae9Zs","published_at":"2015-03-12T17:26:18.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"57994e03c3a3683e0f0018e1"}]}}}
