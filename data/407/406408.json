While she likes Steve the best, she feels she cannot accept him because of his craving for gambling. Cash Wilkins, a bully, insults Steve, whereat he receives a good thrashing, and Wilkins, to get even, insults Katie and steals a small revolver that she carries with her. He then sends a note to Katie, that if she wants the gun back to send Henry for it. Henry is afraid of the bully and frightenedly tells Steve that he is afraid he must lose Katie as he can never face Wilkins. Steve looks pityingly at the coward, and taking the note, goes to Wilkin's cabin, and after another thrashing, makes Wilkins write a note of apology to Katie, and a promise to leave the country forever. Steve gives the note and the girl's gun to Henry and tells him to take them to Katie. The girl never suspects and Steve, realizing that \"two's company and three's a crowd,\" packs his clothes and leaves.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/nXxPndeAgb0XNTKNYTQjpEwvl5u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cowboy Coward","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
