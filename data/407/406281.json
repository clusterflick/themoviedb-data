Using simple brush pens and ink, Mulloy's works are witty and acerbic fables, loaded with graphic images of sex and violence that are both perceptive comments on human nature and challenges to contemporary values. These brilliantly subversive satirical cartoons are definitely not for the squeamish or easily offended.","popularity":0.1691,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extreme Animation: Films by Phil Mulloy","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Mulloy","original_name":"Phil Mulloy","popularity":0.2783,"profile_path":"/ygEse9ptM0z92cMPnNiM7cKjUmh.jpg","credit_id":"57875191c3a36871c9003db9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
