They thought they were making a documentary on the community of tourists, soldiers, and West Berliners who lived in the seemingly eternal presence of the graffiti emblazoned eyesore.  But in 1989, as the original film neared completion, the Wall came down, and McElwee and Levine returned to Berlin, this time to capture the radically different atmosphere of the reunified city.","popularity":0.4864,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4095,"logo_path":"/zR0M1hMBNRKyYnRHMidK9WjUsUX.png","name":"First Run Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something to Do with the Wall","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2a1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1191862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Levine","original_name":"Marilyn Levine","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2a21","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1191862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Levine","original_name":"Marilyn Levine","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2a19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937685,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Bock","original_name":"Richard Bock","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2a27","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2a13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"572ae329925141716e00052e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0145479","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":292,"name":"berlin wall"},{"id":6089,"name":"freedom"},{"id":2106,"name":"cold war"},{"id":6587,"name":"east berlin"},{"id":6588,"name":"west berlin"},{"id":11241,"name":"post war germany"},{"id":156026,"name":"east germany"},{"id":157955,"name":"childhood"},{"id":178712,"name":"totalitarianism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
