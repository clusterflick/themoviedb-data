A glamorous 81-year-old, Doris Payne is as unapologetic today about the nearly $2 million in jewels shes stolen over a 60-year career as she was the day she stole her first carat. With Payne now on trial for the theft of a department store diamond ring, filmmakers Kirk Marcolina and Matthew Pond probe beneath her consummate smile to uncover the secrets of her trade and what drove her to a life of crime. Stylish recreations, an extensive archive and candid interviews reveal how Payne managed to jet-set her way into any Cartier or Tiffanys from Monte Carlo to Japan and walk out with small fortunes. This sensational portrait exposes a rebel who defies societys prejudices and pinches her own version of the American Dream while she steals your heart.","popularity":0.3743,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life & Crimes of Doris Payne","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Payne","original_name":"Doris Payne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e27a5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191810,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Darmyn Calderon","original_name":"Darmyn Calderon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e277d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirk Marcolina","original_name":"Kirk Marcolina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kyle Billingsley","original_name":"Kyle Billingsley","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2783","department":"Sound","job":"Foley"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Marks","original_name":"Tom Marks","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e278f","department":"Sound","job":"Supervising Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan McBride","original_name":"Ryan McBride","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2795","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191813,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noel Vought","original_name":"Noel Vought","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e279b","department":"Sound","job":"Foley"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191814,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kristopher Baldwin","original_name":"Kristopher Baldwin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e27a1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Rivett","original_name":"Mark Rivett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2771","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Pond","original_name":"Matthew Pond","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e275f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Pond","original_name":"Matthew Pond","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e276b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirk Marcolina","original_name":"Kirk Marcolina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2765","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Marks","original_name":"Tom Marks","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d50c3a368484e1e2789","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61796,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter A.
