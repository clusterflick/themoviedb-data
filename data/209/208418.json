For more than ten years, Palazzolo has been delivering to us his captured visions – body builders, senior citizens, erotic parlours, weddings, deli owners, and the like – as if he had harnessed them in a cinematic butterfly net.  AMERICA'S IN REAL TROUBLE is a patriotic film with music and sound by some of the great unknowns of the past. Lots of overtones, undercurrents, innuendoes, visual similes, counterpoints, puns and contrapuntal movement. Filmed in Chicago, it covers several years of parades and civic events. If you're not moved by this film there's no hope for you.","popularity":0.1064,"poster_path":"/fD6SXkrTJz3PjiQ3Yfu2rgzYJQE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America's in Real Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Palazzolo","original_name":"Tom Palazzolo","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/kjuOKH6IUvMu8cBbOPiZTA3WIwa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d4ac3a368484e1e12c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fD6SXkrTJz3PjiQ3Yfu2rgzYJQE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
