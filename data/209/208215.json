The resulting cacophonic sound evokes noise music and the destruction of instruments at rock concerts and in Fluxus performances. The work refers more precisely to a racist murder committed in 1998 not far from the film location - James Byrd Jr. an African American, was dragged by a truck for several kilometers.","popularity":0.0528,"poster_path":"/nkr6Z1mrEPXPceGYDUkOFi0Y4kR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guitar Drag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Marclay","original_name":"Christian Marclay","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a368484e1e0519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15766500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkr6Z1mrEPXPceGYDUkOFi0Y4kR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
