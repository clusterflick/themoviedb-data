It looks as if he might actually turn his life around after he meets a good-hearted woman, when he decides to run a final game of chicken against a juvenile delinquent girl who gets killed in the ensuing crash. The terrified boy then takes his girlfriend and splits. He is later shot-down by the police. Later the authorities learn that the boy was set upon his crooked path by policemen who beat him when he was younger.","popularity":1.2001,"poster_path":"/6rY4KntDbpy8mSFEhWfX3UIw6qY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Santa Cruz Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1958-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's Hell-on-Wheels... fired up for any thrill !","title":"Hot Car Girl","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bakalyan","original_name":"Richard Bakalyan","popularity":0.5323,"profile_path":"/a9dYf0sOQ2Eh3WydfkDxW3e2Tl4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Walter 'Duke' Willis","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a368484e1e06d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Kenney","original_name":"June Kenney","popularity":0.2484,"profile_path":"/4gDEvMFlYMjSr1IWlFcrJbahxTI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margaret 'Peg' Dale","credit_id":"52fe4d46c3a368484e1e06dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Knapp","original_name":"Robert Knapp","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/3igajJZLKUP4N4iEL19x73C4t2E.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Det.
