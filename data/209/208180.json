She has no luck in becoming pregnant and this leads to an estrangement from her husband. On his latest flight, Greg, a professional pilot, finds out about a bomb threat. The person carrying the bomb supposedly wants to kill another passenger, a politician with an outspoken opinion on abortion. Unknown to the killer, however, the politician has already left the plane because it had an hour and a half delay. Greg decides to make an emergency landing in Dayton, Ohio, but during the heavy weather, the plane crashes, killing almost everyone on board.","popularity":2.0678,"poster_path":"/29I20y7Y5ZEJaJ41FcutWM8R9L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schaefer/Karpf Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citadel Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":27067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Consolidated Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Disaster Strikes Everybody Pays ...
