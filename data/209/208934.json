Here the story follows protagonist Scott (Casey), a businessman out for his morning run when he comes across ruthless ex-con couple Razor and Julie (Schilens and Wharton). After witnessing them callously run over a dog on the road, Scott has a gun pulled in his face and is forced to join them on their Death Race 20000-inspired joy ride as the pair attempt to gain a better “score” than their partner.","popularity":0.1671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Razor's Ring","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Casey","original_name":"Wayne Casey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Scott","credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3fdd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AnnieScott Rogers","original_name":"AnnieScott Rogers","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Red","credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3fe1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192294,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Schilens","original_name":"Paul Schilens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Razor","credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3fe5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Wharton","original_name":"Lisa Wharton","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3fe9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Duncan","original_name":"Nate Duncan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/l1Lkhr4fxNFEizAzMBzqXm01rim.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fisher","credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3fed","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Morgan Hampton","original_name":"Morgan Hampton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3ff9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Hampton","original_name":"Morgan Hampton","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d57c3a368484e1e3ff3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1189441","wikidata_id":"Q4265175","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
