Upon arrival he is furious to find his father alive and well and even more so when he then discovers he can't leave. Soon, father and son are forced to deal with a painful history. At the core of their conflict is Larry's denial about the death of his wife, Jack's mother. The story explores the difficult and painful, but often very hilarious ways they try to communicate. Forging a begrudging peace, the reality of life sets in when Larry discloses to Jack another truth that leads to a final reconciliation.","popularity":1,"poster_path":"/wvfIk4pgoGDMkWo5rtxKA1QlQa6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Equus
