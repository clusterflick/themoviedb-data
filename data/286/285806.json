Led by the local nobleman (Arthur Ehrens), they find an appropriate spot, and the festivities begin. Some children briefly perform a charming folk dance. Suddenly the R端bezahl arrives and threatens to kill all the townsfolk if they don't leave immediately.","popularity":0.4339,"poster_path":"/4wkHi8nwKJzEjReK7oTZdfiapN6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG
