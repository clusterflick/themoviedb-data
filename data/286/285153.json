Pete, Brierson's brother, in hiding because of his criminal record, burns the colonel's barn and injures his horses. Convinced of Brierson's responsibility for the terror tactics, \"Lucky\" Larkin plans to ride Tarzan, the colonel's pet colt. Brierson does his best to disqualify the horse, but Larkin tricks him and wins the race. Larkin captures Pete and forces him to confess. The Brierson brothers are brought to justice, and Larkin wins Emmy Lou, a homesteader's daughter.","popularity":0.27,"poster_path":"/oTNrwMACKXcliuZH6ESJyBsdfs1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16682,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ken Maynard Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Larkin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Maynard","original_name":"Ken Maynard","popularity":0.3031,"profile_path":"/wKJAhS81beZVLGW6rRgrVmxPszL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"'Lucky' Larkin","credit_id":"53df7ac6c3a3683b570002aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Lane","original_name":"Nora Lane","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/AW4egmMYg6E0pBEZnMNw82InCR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Emmy Lou Parkinson","credit_id":"53df7ae2c3a3686c4d0025af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Farley","original_name":"Jim Farley","popularity":0.4315,"profile_path":"/155ugk9VWe00T7wWSo3pqb9b80d.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Martin Brierson","credit_id":"53df7affc3a3686c510024d0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hurst","original_name":"Paul Hurst","popularity":0.3319,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pete Brierson","credit_id":"53df7b32c3a3683b570002b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Todd","original_name":"Harry Todd","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/98T2jrTJCLo39PV7XOX2BBHzmff.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Parkinson","credit_id":"53df7b18c3a3686c560024db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Clary","original_name":"Charles Clary","popularity":0.2506,"profile_path":"/nAEqw3M130Wco0N1g0IVFWFvUE6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Colonel Lee","credit_id":"53df7b4dc3a3686c6000235b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blue Washington","original_name":"Blue Washington","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/i1yJbmPG4oqsWsPu07md4fr20Wo.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hambone","credit_id":"53df7b62c3a3686c560024dd","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harry Joe Brown","original_name":"Harry Joe Brown","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53df7a54c3a3683b570002a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105461,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fred Allen","original_name":"Fred Allen","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53df7a9fc3a3686c60002349","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Maynard","original_name":"Ken Maynard","popularity":0.3031,"profile_path":"/wKJAhS81beZVLGW6rRgrVmxPszL.jpg","credit_id":"53df7a7cc3a3683fc0000294","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ted D.
