This new set is the first collection of Miles's Third Great Quintet, the \"Lost\" Band of 1968-1970 with Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette at their peak (they were never recorded in the studio). The album captures the short-lived quintet in three separate concert settings, starting with two full-length (one hour-plus) sets at the Antibes Jazz Festival in France, in Stockholm as part of \"The Newport Jazz Festival In Europe,\" and completed with a stunning 46-minute performance at the Berlin Philharmonie, filmed in color.
