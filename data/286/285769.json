But just on the day of his wedding, he reads a notice on the wall explaining how to behave in the case of an enemy air raid. The fear that grips him makes him even too literal in implementing safety indications, causing trouble and accidents that will not only stop him from enjoying his first marital night, but will even cause the collapse of the whole house. In the end, the gendarmes go to him with a conscription notice and take him away under coercion, under the appalled gaze of his new bride.","popularity":0.1609,"poster_path":"/nXPcjGgCprenYNr3kSXWFpNDWoa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Itala Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1915-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fear of Zeppelins","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Toribio tiene miedo a los aeroplanos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Deed","original_name":"André Deed","popularity":0.3646,"profile_path":"/prazmRnbuIUeHO6McGOUQHDUeOd.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53e49a660e0a262b86006794","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonie Laporte","original_name":"Leonie Laporte","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53e49a840e0a262b80006816","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Gambino","original_name":"Domenico Gambino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8x3nydrxxJwUMCoRceOI4nn9BC4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53e49a8c0e0a262b8c006602","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felice Minotti","original_name":"Felice Minotti","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57afedac9251413a91000e87","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Deed","original_name":"André Deed","popularity":0.3646,"profile_path":"/prazmRnbuIUeHO6McGOUQHDUeOd.jpg","credit_id":"53e49ab00e0a262b91006301","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"57afeda2c3a36814f6003564","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0413103","wikidata_id":"Q3823496","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nXPcjGgCprenYNr3kSXWFpNDWoa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
