They work all night long, every day of the week, as their families used to do. They live in Gorgiti, a village in Tuscany, on the mountains near Arezzo. On the other hand, in Rome, some young people live near Camellia's Square at Centocelle, in the suburbs. We see them at different moments in their lives. Their existences seem to belong to distant and very different universes. There seems to be an irreconcilable generation conflict. The film makes use of documentary and fiction, but tries to amalgamate them while simultaneously using them as opposites.","popularity":0.0681,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lontane Province Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread/Camellia's Square","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Pauluzzi","original_name":"Chiara Pauluzzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"53e384960e0a262b800044a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350631,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fulvio Baglivi","original_name":"Fulvio Baglivi","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53e3849d0e0a262b800044ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Cocolini","original_name":"Chiara Cocolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"53e384a70e0a262b8f004225","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Cocolini","original_name":"Carlo Cocolini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"53e384ae0e0a262b8c00424f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véronique Bouteille","original_name":"Véronique Bouteille","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"53e384ba0e0a262b8300430b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"53e384560e0a262b830042f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"53e384660e0a262b910040e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"53e3847c0e0a262b8900432d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350629,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Véronique Bouteille","original_name":"Véronique Bouteille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e384880e0a262b8600432f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"5fab95b3c048a9003e4b2b80","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariella Navale","original_name":"Mariella Navale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fab95c5126ec3003f7bfcac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1540935,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gianluca Stazi","original_name":"Gianluca Stazi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fab95d541a5610041a37b92","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariella Navale","original_name":"Mariella Navale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fab95e3c8f858003d7d6ccd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851980,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Silvia Palermo","original_name":"Silvia Palermo","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fab95ed53866e0040177a50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
