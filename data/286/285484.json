In the 1950s, in the Belgian harbor town Antwerp, there is not a lot off future for a jazz musician. Jack and his band try to earn a living by playing at weddings and the odd tea party, usually resulting in mixed emotions and hilarious scenes. Most of the time, he earns a living by unloading bananas in the Antwerp docks. Jack is convinced that New York is the place to be for a jazz musician, but where will he get the money for the big trip? And what is more important: a woman or a saxophone?","popularity":0.086,"poster_path":"/h4DNEgZRicTLriH18TImZEOouKl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Friends","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Auberghen","original_name":"Stéphane Auberghen","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/fT1Dv0uAePMY0rmMs5BraXfuB4f.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53e1e33b0e0a262b800006a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Aerts","original_name":"Philippe Aerts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53e1e36e0e0a262b7d00064d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc-Henri Wajnberg","original_name":"Marc-Henri Wajnberg","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e1e3060e0a262b8000069a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107291","wikidata_id":"Q3190278","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h4DNEgZRicTLriH18TImZEOouKl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
