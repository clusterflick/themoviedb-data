Bosnia had been divided in two entities, which separated the two main opposing forces of the conflict; the Serb Bosnians and the Muslim Bosnians. Two years later, in 1998, I returned to Bosnia... This movie is a diary of the two voyages, in which I deal with the memories of the war, the death and destruction and with the victim’s struggle who don’t know how to return home.","popularity":0.1085,"poster_path":"/iOWChw6oAAbuouZjL2WHIAjMGzn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16421,"logo_path":"/A5ZNlCF9yzcIqmvD8WQtHK9htg8.png","name":"Rosa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2006-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The diary of two travels to Bosnia (1996 and 1998) and the clash with the memories of war.","title":"Bosnia Diaries","video":false,"vote_average":7.75,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquim Sapinho","original_name":"Joaquim Sapinho","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/xBhIXEOu4fMQWrYnXwznDJPc7l3.jpg","credit_id":"53e3cc9a0e0a262b86004c6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquim Sapinho","original_name":"Joaquim Sapinho","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/xBhIXEOu4fMQWrYnXwznDJPc7l3.jpg","credit_id":"5ef0f6aced96bc0036edb5c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquim Sapinho","original_name":"Joaquim Sapinho","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/xBhIXEOu4fMQWrYnXwznDJPc7l3.jpg","credit_id":"5ef0f6c4283ed900358f9773","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1786494,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vítor Alves","original_name":"Vítor Alves","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef0f6d1ed96bc0035ed938a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno Carvalho","original_name":"Nuno Carvalho","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef0f6e22e2b2c00376eeb23","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno Carvalho","original_name":"Nuno Carvalho","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef0f6fa41429100346d8112","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73757,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria João Sigalho","original_name":"Maria João Sigalho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef0f7095684630032049984","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281229,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amândio Coroado","original_name":"Amândio Coroado","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef0f71841429100336ceb6c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0490897","wikidata_id":"Q4947318","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/iOWChw6oAAbuouZjL2WHIAjMGzn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
