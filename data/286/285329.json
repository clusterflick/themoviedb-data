Thus, Jim asks the boy, whom he protects like a brother, to speak for him. When he is spurned by Ronnie, Harvey decides to join Red Slade's gang, who are plotting a raid on the Wind River herd. As Jim forcibly attempts to separate him from the gang, Harvey is killed; and through the aid of his horse, Tarzan, Jim foils Slade's attempt to stampede the herd. Slade takes refuge in a wagon where Ronnie is hiding; Jim rescues Ronnie from the wagon just before the runaway team plunges over a cliff with Slade riding to his doom.","popularity":0.32,"poster_path":"/dqibu0fsKwESwT6VJIOmTBes7u7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16682,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ken Maynard Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sons of the Saddle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Maynard","original_name":"Ken Maynard","popularity":0.3031,"profile_path":"/wKJAhS81beZVLGW6rRgrVmxPszL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jim Brandon","credit_id":"53e0afee0e0a265a83006bfb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Hill","original_name":"Doris Hill","popularity":0.2554,"profile_path":"/zxrs2sZTVi649BRp6iRbRdCE3V1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Veronica 'Ronnie' Stavnow","credit_id":"53e0b0120e0a265a96006bfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph W.
