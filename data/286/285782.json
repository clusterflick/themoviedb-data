One day, they are led by circumstances to welcome a little boy Pierre, whose father is in jail, into their home. Which makes Louise Noblet all the happier as she can't have children herself. But, after a while, Pierre's father is released from prison and reclaims his son... Time passes and Pierre, now a young adult, lives in Paris more or less on the wrong side of the law. He has a mistress, Nelly, who does not say no to other men's money... Louise, who still loves Pierre as her own son, wants only one thing - to help him get by.","popularity":0.5033,"poster_path":"/79b7CHlcR8PYXJgCy30NTWDC4w8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société des films sonores Tobis","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1935-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pension Mimosas","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Rosay","original_name":"Françoise Rosay","popularity":0.2664,"profile_path":"/4thdZsgdUAdFvggzlaMI0qCYaGG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Louise Noblet","credit_id":"53e4a8c50e0a262b7d00667f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bernard","original_name":"Paul Bernard","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":"/ktiKD3Wacwy2LO0Jfz5W0h2tVWZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pierre Brabant","credit_id":"53e4a8d00e0a262b8c0067bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lise Delamare","original_name":"Lise Delamare","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/sueKzDiOPWivZ7QtwhAVBbjFhwK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nelly","credit_id":"53e4a8d90e0a262b8300687a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arletty","original_name":"Arletty","popularity":0.1839,"profile_path":"/idM1MGVv2rzPGvo7AukttJuTQ2X.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kid Parasol","credit_id":"570bd96a9251413c85000455","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Max","original_name":"Jean-Max","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/qNDiWExqmJCD0lpEuXK9nBlzD55.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Romani","credit_id":"61f5f0db81140f00ee4a6124","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Azaïs","original_name":"Paul Azaïs","popularity":0.4516,"profile_path":"/48li5D07TJH60jGrK6vwdT1cHOb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Carlo","credit_id":"61f5f0df7776f00043be093a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Cordy","original_name":"Raymond Cordy","popularity":0.1597,"profile_path":"/d2A3UUlSoemwnMN5D8VzCPLfltV.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Morel","credit_id":"61f5f0eabb10570117aa8dce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3401855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ila Mecséry","original_name":"Ila Mecséry","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Vilma","credit_id":"61f5f0f0cedac42047c80226","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":298988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Labry","original_name":"Pierre Labry","popularity":0.2031,"profile_path":"/4b2UOC7SgjyaLAO9ODmRzRobTT4.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Parisian hotelier","credit_id":"61f5f0fe6331b200bef7c6ef","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddy Debray","original_name":"Eddy Debray","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/c9Z1KmrDlMgi9VANBKtseRJzcBt.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Pierre's father","credit_id":"61f5f10481140f00ee4a6196","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":298274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Burnay","original_name":"Jenny Burnay","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/xMSFQXUc1Lw9K2Jxac1BWZNsQ9o.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Maid of the Mimosas guesthouse","credit_id":"61f5f111c5ada500681bc806","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170384,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Georges K.
