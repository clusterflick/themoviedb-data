Subverting state-sponsored informational films on such issues as war bonds and highway safety, Plays transforms these agit-prop rhetorics into a celluloid mirror of transgression as a larger cultural pathology. In Zero Hour, the results - the products of war return to the initial cite of production: an assumed audience of Americans, middle-class citizens of an ideal suburban dream who have somehow foregone the immediate experiences and repercussion of mass destruction and displacement. The gaze rests on us. We are the sugar-stated, hyper and unaware violator, an audience whose relationship to world events is nowhere more homogeneous than in or communal incubation and guilt.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Plays","original_name":"Dana Plays","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e37c8dc3a368485800215c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0462728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"1992-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
