Soon after, a mental hospital was built on the ruins. The first patients to be committed were Holocaust survivors. A legend says that to this day, the survivors have been communicating with the ghosts of the village. Forgiveness tells the story of David Adler, a 20-year old American-Israeli who decides to move back to Israel, only to find himself committed to a mental institution that sits on the ruins of a Palestinian village called Deir Yassin. Flashbacks and flashforwards reveal the events that led up to his hospitalization.","popularity":0.2331,"poster_path":"/8zeLG0rMdisgJuby8ClFA4Vmzpz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgiveness","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itay Tiran","original_name":"Itay Tiran","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/bh5rogJKY7l4dEeeWGpNQ4Gx2qG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"David","credit_id":"5d330f5f6a300b1834ab403b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Khoury","original_name":"Clara Khoury","popularity":0.2436,"profile_path":"/zTyoLbT54uATo2uEjhIE90XKYpr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lila","credit_id":"5d330f7e2f8d094522d9ab12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moni Moshonov","original_name":"Moni Moshonov","popularity":0.4481,"profile_path":"/9JigKYNNFDr0fx2k4toOY0J3mZq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jakoov","credit_id":"5d330f9d6a300b2f7ea4f82f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makram J.
