And he, speaking in court as a prosecutor, remains deaf to the dictates of feelings, a ruthless servant of the harsh Law. Some time later, Betsy kills her new lover in a fit of jealousy; Olsen, who retained his feelings, nevertheless becomes her accuser at the trial. He seeks the condemnation of Betsy, but comes to the realization that he lived unrighteously, allowing himself to be judged, becoming a servant of Themis. Exit in the classic tradition of the great mute: Olsen commits suicide.","popularity":0.0618,"poster_path":"/lNExHjbbiSdl5IfScWrzHJf9a0L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88753,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yermoliev","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1917-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prosecutor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Public Prosecutor","type":"alternative translation"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Во имя долга","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Голос совести","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Lissenko","original_name":"Наталья Лисенко","popularity":0.1932,"profile_path":"/atjyUL8RowG3Hi2PtP8YxpA2KhU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Betty Clay, artist from cafe chantant","credit_id":"53e61fa6c3a3684433001005","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Mosjoukine","original_name":"Иван Мозжухин","popularity":0.2136,"profile_path":"/3t0mkRloYibAYNN64ZC9o7xadQX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eric Olsen, prosecutor","credit_id":"53e61fadc3a368443c000f6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2924576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Orlova","original_name":"Вера Орлова","popularity":0.1473,"profile_path":"/gTPUeILptj4R1fym5Iiko3jaMir.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Olsen's sister","credit_id":"5ff4c103417aaf003fb2eb54","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1261778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Kondorova","original_name":"Olga Kondorova","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/sZqlbDE3NxNlSQDZfKJnybLbVcu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5ce760220e0a265ac0d0692c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yakov Protazanov","original_name":"Yakov Protazanov","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/sMu7cbGFVamc3LShNpuGZZkTdJh.jpg","credit_id":"53e61f9bc3a36844420010fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195656,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph N.
