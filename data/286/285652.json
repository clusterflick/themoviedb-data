But on her maiden voyage in April 1912, that dream became a nightmare when the giant ship struck an iceberg and sunk in the cold North Atlantic. More than 1,500 lives were lost in one of the greatest disasters of the 20th century. Now, using newsreels, stills, diaries, and exclusive interviews with survivors, Titanic: The Complete Story recounts the sensational history of the premier liner.  In Part I: Death of a Dream, the largest ship ever built is christened in Ireland before a cheering crowd of 100,000. Witness the disaster this trek becomes as numerous iceberg warnings go unheeded and the ship sinks in the icy North Atlantic.  In Part II: The Legend Lives On, over-packed lifeboats edge away from the crippled liner as a futile SOS signals flare into the night--leaving 1,500 passengers to a watery grave.","popularity":2.7798,"poster_path":"/A3uQMYg0Acc7pKWp0z5mDK1MYR7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greystone Communications","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18441,"logo_path":"/rJmXT9sgCKG8uSUO1T93kOTfAzm.png","name":"A+E Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Titanic: The Complete Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","title":"Titanic - L'incroyable trag√©die","type":"DVD"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Titanic: Death of a Dream","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Titanic: The Legend Lives On","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David McCallum","original_name":"David McCallum","popularity":1.6451,"profile_path":"/blpEToArrhcrYdRlQU6fJckUcuG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"58f5fdadc3a3680e2100b513","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert D.
