Roger, a self-described 'fall-down drunk' and sniper in Vietnam, and Kouy, a Cambodian refugee who fought the Khmer Rouge, bonded in the bustling tent-city known as Mushroom Camp, which pops up each autumn in the Oregon woods. Their friendship became an adoptive family; according to a Cambodian custom, if you lose your family like Kouy, you must rebuilt it anew. Now, however, this new family could be lost. Roger's health is declining and trauma flashbacks rack his mind; Kouy gently aids his family before the snow falls and the hunting season ends, signaling his time to leave.","popularity":0.6239,"poster_path":"/p27xVAwejLTjZluWwyoZuz9p0Fm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filament Productions LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":89142,"logo_path":"/bfMAgFDoS5niHK077WKdoUMgLHp.png","name":"Department of Motion Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Season","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Higgins","original_name":"Roger Higgins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65666bf96c0b3600c74591e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4402255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuoy Loch","original_name":"Kuoy Loch","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65666bff89d97f00fe7c3d9a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1349268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Dosa","original_name":"Sara Dosa","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/tF5eNhayoaQP852ZdvYxRFQjmBL.jpg","credit_id":"53de695f0e0a265a8d00274a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1349268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Dosa","original_name":"Sara Dosa","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/tF5eNhayoaQP852ZdvYxRFQjmBL.jpg","credit_id":"5c05118e92514111160b4092","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Penn","original_name":"Josh Penn","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0511e392514116540ca4da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187892,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oscar Chabebe","original_name":"Oscar Chabebe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0511000e0a26486a08b681","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187897,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Star Rosencrans","original_name":"Star Rosencrans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1TqgVQi6YjX9mrojva57rLvWrF6.jpg","credit_id":"5c0511479251417e2e071c7e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078398,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aaron C.
