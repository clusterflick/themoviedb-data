This first \"Mademoiselle Midnight\" is banished in the opening scene by Napoleon III at Empress Eugenie's insistence to Mexico. Renee is kept locked at the hacienda at night by her father to prevent her following in her grandmother's wayward footsteps. She falls in love with a visiting American (Monte Blue) but is also pursued by the craven outlaw Manuel Corrales. Miss Murray gets to do some of her trademark dancing, but this one isn't a comedy, despite comic relief provided by Johnny Arthur.","popularity":0.1152,"poster_path":"/vnWyg237cy9MHAt2HGW7EsgBGg9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mademoiselle Midnight","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Murray","original_name":"Mae Murray","popularity":0.1757,"profile_path":"/wGcqEVIwuyusftoRCrvAn0SNtr0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Renée de Gontran / Renée de Quiros","credit_id":"53ff76b1c3a36843660002d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John St. Polis","original_name":"John St. Polis","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/q242vTdxgXFTVjmtDB5sPjxfhHy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Colonel de Gontran (Prologue)","credit_id":"53ff76bcc3a368436900029a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weigel","original_name":"Paul Weigel","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/9NTRs4Hkg1HbEXd2zHINobcfwH8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Napoleon III (Prologue)","credit_id":"53ff76c7c3a368436c000297","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Schenck","original_name":"Earl Schenck","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/qzMXztnPnFCcbmSI4550Tt3GbZ8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Emperor Maximilian - Prologue","credit_id":"53ff76d2c3a368437200026a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarissa Selwynne","original_name":"Clarissa Selwynne","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/jrm9O5lWXqYOOsEw0DH3ovuHz0H.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Empress Eugénie - Prologue","credit_id":"53ff76dec3a368436c000299","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
