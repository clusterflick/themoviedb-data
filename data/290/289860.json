The fun begins when one bets the other $20,000 that he, with an all girl crew, be the first to Tahiti in a sailboat race. The other, not to be outdone, has a few monkeyshines up his sleeve and actually wins the race. The beaten bettor then makes the claim, that he can beat the victor to the mainland using a crew comprised of baboons. That is too much to resist for the other and the race is on.","popularity":1.0914,"poster_path":"/sYNk9xonWrQH7uV72SsdQCa30Wq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31501,"logo_path":null,"name":"United National","origin_country":""},{"id":13754,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Telefilm Associates (NTA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's ship-shapely all-girl crew took turns shaping up for the captain's watch","title":"I Sailed to Tahiti with an All Girl Crew","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gardner McKay","original_name":"Gardner McKay","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/wal1ayRhxIe5PRZuAqck1AIx15u.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Terry O'Brien","credit_id":"540395a7c3a3682d98003c87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Clark","original_name":"Fred Clark","popularity":0.2671,"profile_path":"/yBjSwb6xma9ukYpbSe75C0eqNTx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"'Generous' Josh","credit_id":"540395b7c3a3685b74000ebc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane McBain","original_name":"Diane McBain","popularity":0.3549,"profile_path":"/1FmUJDzGkr74wmBYRdmI4NfDHGM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Liz Clark","credit_id":"540395c7c3a36843720054b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Buttram","original_name":"Pat Buttram","popularity":0.5154,"profile_path":"/jRVB0shCimyljcDYlIUpdcAVe8E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Blodgett","credit_id":"540395d6c3a3685b74000ec0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Denning","original_name":"Richard Denning","popularity":0.5001,"profile_path":"/xBDoxyNeRyi4uOvnH2OsmkvJQYi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Commodore","credit_id":"540395eac3a36843720054b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edy Williams","original_name":"Edy Williams","popularity":0.2642,"profile_path":"/p8jMLfwNQyDKZkitb4ZlUpe9EWr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marilyn","credit_id":"540395fac3a36843660056f0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Rainer","original_name":"Jeanne Rainer","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Monique","credit_id":"5403961fc3a3685b74000ec8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Louie","original_name":"Bebe Louie","popularity":0.1325,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Tomaya","credit_id":"54039633c3a36843720054bd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1240825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlene Charles","original_name":"Arlene Charles","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/tA36G43xZC2zENmY0Od5GxURJ1F.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Janet","credit_id":"54039644c3a36816af000a83","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3431515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary O'Brien","original_name":"Mary O'Brien","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Jimsy","credit_id":"66089bede1faed017dfc36d3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard L.
