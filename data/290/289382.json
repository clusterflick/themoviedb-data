While going through his swiftly appointed rounds, Eddie stumbles upon a gang of crooks who are planning a large-scale confidence scam. He exposes the villains and wins the love of heroine Madge (Jobyna Ralston). Though Cantor was a fine physical comic, he didn't truly score in films until the arrival of talkies allowed his fans to hear as well as see him. Special Delivery was directed by \"William Goodrich,\" who in reality was comedian Fatty Arbuckle, hoping to stage a comeback after the sex scandal that destroyed his career.","popularity":0.2793,"poster_path":"/d9F9otX4lKhUCp9TjDlMR0QezLL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"EDDIE AMIDST THE MAILS AND FEMALES","title":"Special Delivery","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Cantor","original_name":"Eddie Cantor","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/dLT22f96NG4fmD26dz8HDP3k6qo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eddie Beagle - the Mail Carrier","credit_id":"540102540e0a2658f100303a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jobyna Ralston","original_name":"Jobyna Ralston","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/rJ8CRYD3rZUik37k7p6ZFu8wAUq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madge Warren","credit_id":"5401025f0e0a2658de0032f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Powell","original_name":"William Powell","popularity":0.5224,"profile_path":"/8DTWs389THkVCTiDFu0x8ekNmUC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Harold Jones","credit_id":"5401028f0e0a2658e200325e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1205558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Julienne Scott","original_name":"Mabel Julienne Scott","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/4HBNuzfVOJt2Lu8hgPvdslAQhXd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Jones","credit_id":"5401029d0e0a2658ee00314e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":949793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Dougherty","original_name":"Jack Dougherty","popularity":0.1548,"profile_path":"/nn3lNBBosMM5dJp7EdNRYBsQqrV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Flannigan - the Cop","credit_id":"540102a70e0a2658ee003150","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Keith","original_name":"Donald Keith","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":"/r2QeV8VSongBRNp6N5k1Kxsj1jn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harrigan - the Fireman","credit_id":"540102b10e0a2658e90031d8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Stern","original_name":"Louis Stern","popularity":0.0581,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John Beagle","credit_id":"540102bb0e0a2658ee003152","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marilyn Cantor Baker","original_name":"Marilyn Cantor Baker","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Little Girl on Street","credit_id":"540102db0e0a2658e200326b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Cantor","original_name":"Marjorie Cantor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Little Girl on Street","credit_id":"540102f80e0a2658f1003049","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Doll","original_name":"Tiny Doll","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Baby on Eddie's Route","credit_id":"540103020e0a2658e2003272","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Livingston","original_name":"Robert Livingston","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/9TDnvUPeWnBS7mPeGeIlHhTLLIe.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Postal Ball Guest","credit_id":"5401030c0e0a2658f100304f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Cantor Metzger","original_name":"Natalie Cantor Metzger","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Little Girl on Street","credit_id":"540103150e0a2658f1003052","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spec O'Donnell","original_name":"Spec O'Donnell","popularity":0.1855,"profile_path":"/aFHLZETFw9KepZTZqo13bllNdC9.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Office Boy","credit_id":"5401031e0e0a2658e6003224","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Rosanova","original_name":"Rosa Rosanova","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/zPE88Booef9mqqjS71wWElwBhGj.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Sidney's Mother","credit_id":"540103290e0a2658db0031cc","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John F.
