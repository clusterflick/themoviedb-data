On their sons' 21st birthday, Eckberg tells them the great family secret:  Knut and Michael aren't his children (happy birthday, kids ... oh!  and did I mention Santa Claus doesn't exist either?).  But thankfully, the news gets better:  their real mother died giving birth to them (guilt trip ... guilt trip!) and the Eckbergs decided to adopt the boys and bring them up in a proper family (no doubt so they could shatter their lives with this tale on their 21st birthday).  But hey:  it made everyone forget about the War going on outside the theatre, right?","popularity":0.2293,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1943-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sophienlund","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Liedtke","original_name":"Harry Liedtke","popularity":0.331,"profile_path":"/6uub4Y8JGTi2MmzbFVq5DD2Yf5o.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Erick Eckberg","credit_id":"53fe5aabc3a3684c86001704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Käthe Haack","original_name":"Käthe Haack","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":"/moKY8JWgzcjEgZw769d3qyd9S3X.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sigrid Eckberg","credit_id":"53fe5abac3a3684c89001652","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannelore Schroth","original_name":"Hannelore Schroth","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/1pPdox3wDLQMwefuoRPoxZ39qdx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gabriele Eckberg","credit_id":"53fe5acbc3a3684c8c00172f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Quest","original_name":"Hans Quest","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/xSYpTy7ChmQIX5yyGUwCMl9r1yL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jürgen","credit_id":"53fe5ae3c3a3684c7a0016c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette Bethge","original_name":"Jeanette Bethge","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Selma","credit_id":"53fe5af7c3a3684c8600170d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Rühmann","original_name":"Heinz Rühmann","popularity":0.3479,"profile_path":"/va392zg2RW7laSTaKgqV9lvCiJg.jpg","credit_id":"53fe5a98c3a3684c800016e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037299","wikidata_id":"Q82654317","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
