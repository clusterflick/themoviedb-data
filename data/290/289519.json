Combining exclusive interview and performance footage with vintage clips and the music of many Blues legends long gone, the history of this richly felt music is illuminated - from its African roots to its American urban expression - along with its profound place in our cultural heritage. The result is a rare, first-hand glimpse into the lives of these vanishing artists, and a moving, insightful and informative look into a music that continues to be loved by millions throughout the world.","popularity":0.2571,"poster_path":"/u0jSEaqMENoaWMKNooTCgkUbLQb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blues Story","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Levey","original_name":"Jay Levey","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/kOx3UZ0lYVs7j73iY6Sgf2ba1cj.jpg","credit_id":"5401f316c3a368068c0034e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78655,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Marritz","original_name":"Ed Marritz","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5401f32ac3a36843630033f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2194492","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u0jSEaqMENoaWMKNooTCgkUbLQb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2636,"name":"blues"},{"id":175506,"name":"blues music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
