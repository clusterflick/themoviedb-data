Do they influence violent behavior? What effect have they had on society? How would you describe videogames to Leonardo da Vinci? These are always great questions to start a conversation.  Pixel Poetry is a documentary film about progressive creative culture as it has been championed by one of its greatest advocates - videogames. Using popular debates that have long surrounded videogames as a catalyst for this, the film will analyze the misunderstood notions and arguments in art and technological advancement to bring a new perspective to a compelling discussion about the evolution of its meaning.","popularity":0.0943,"poster_path":"/iW0WtSftGsyOYKJoMixCZCTlnAT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devolver
