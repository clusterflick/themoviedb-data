When Hera, queen of the gods who despises the great earth-dwelling Hercules, starts throwing trouble in his path every chance she gets, he is in for a world of difficulties. To make matters worse, the handsome half-god has fallen in love with Deianira, the young woman betrothed to Eurystheus, the King of Argos. Together Hera and Eurystheus team up and send Hercules to perform the famous Twelve Labors of Hercules - nearly impossible feats of strength, cunning, and bravery.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storybook Classics: Hercules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
