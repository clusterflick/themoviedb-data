On the way, Švejk makes Lukáš uncomfortable with a bald superior, a passenger in civilian clothes, and then because of pulling the handbrake, he is removed from the train and brought to the station master. The fine for Švejk will be paid by one lucky man, for whom Švejk's stopping of the train catapulted his beloved woman directly into his arms. Švejk goes to Budějovice on foot. His journey is full of humorous incidents. After arriving at the barracks, the regiment with Švejk and Lukáš is soon sent to Hungary, where Lukáš has an adventure with Mrs. Kakonyová. Eventually, the unit including Švejk arrives all the way to the Russian front.
