Ogawa chose to locate his company in the most radical of the villages, Heta. Some farmers immediately sold their land; others vehemently protested and drew the support of social movements across the country. Together they clashed with riot police sent in to protect surveyors, who were plotting out the airport. Summer in Sanrizuka is a messy film – its chaos communicating the passions and actions on the ground.","popularity":0.1763,"poster_path":"/woiyk7YKeN6Oqcm6e2DZDcu15H9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ogawa Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1968-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle Front for the Liberation of Japan – Summer in Sanrizuka","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Summer In Narita","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Nihon Kaiho sensen: Sanrizuka no natsu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70631,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masaki Tamura","original_name":"たむらまさき","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62967525ca83541353b3b305","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hideko Kobayashi","original_name":"Hideko Kobayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296753c1e9225004f7aaf54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316926,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hiroo Fuseya","original_name":"Hiroo Fuseya","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629675459defda009c1c27a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Takatsugu Ichiyama","original_name":"Takatsugu Ichiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629675547e403d0066827dd4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620088,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takako Sekizawa","original_name":"Takako Sekizawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62967b6c6ee3d700a6165117","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinsuke Ogawa","original_name":"小川紳介","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/mMYATdAymePuhX9W93OT0P9Vcus.jpg","credit_id":"5454e6e4c3a368148000441e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462266,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Koshiro Otsu","original_name":"Koshiro Otsu","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc2c5d10e0a264d93ed8977","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0063351","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1098,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/woiyk7YKeN6Oqcm6e2DZDcu15H9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":732}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
