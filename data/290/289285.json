Paul meets Maggie Mutt, and Paul, being a pedigree canine and somewhat of a cad, lures trusting Maggie to the barn to have his way. He then departs for his palatial doghouse at the Livingston estate. Meanwhile Maggie is broken-hearted and also finds that she is in a \"family way\", and gives birth to a pup she names Hank. Maggie tells Hank to find his \"human \", and departs the scene. Hank goes to the park, meets a \"human\" named Mary Kelly, who is a homeless waif and sweetheart of poverty, and the two adopt each other. Later on in the park Paul comes strolling along with his 'human', John. A child falls into the lake and Paul and Hank team up to save her.","popularity":0.4375,"poster_path":"/moQ1nav0MND8j1XknJh0Qi5WmQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28230,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeMille Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost Human","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Reynolds","original_name":"Vera Reynolds","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":"/3FlKE7zAHoUZKNIWO1AlMTYJfOA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Kelly","credit_id":"54005a09c3a3684363001452","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Thomson","original_name":"Kenneth Thomson","popularity":0.3193,"profile_path":"/btGRY1QCYDPuDxDRg9guqWncKae.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"John Livingston","credit_id":"54005a25c3a3684363001458","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Wales","original_name":"Ethel Wales","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/8TspAWWfu1IvRbQ46FrD9hJrtoO.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Katie","credit_id":"54005a82c3a368436c001407","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Majel Coleman","original_name":"Majel Coleman","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/h9q2teGqfBYOlhCfNGITI10oQMP.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Cecile Adams","credit_id":"54005a3ec3a368436300145a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Livingston","credit_id":"54005a57c3a368436300145d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Walton","original_name":"Fred Walton","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"54005abec3a368436c00140b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Urson","original_name":"Frank Urson","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5400594dc3a368437200142d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clara Beranger","original_name":"Clara Beranger","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/vHoCrLTi2NO6fYEjKxanDsTmmfE.jpg","credit_id":"54005960c3a3680603001239","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090727,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Harding Davis","original_name":"Richard Harding Davis","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54005979c3a368436c0013ef","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William C. de Mille","original_name":"William C. de Mille","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5400598ec3a368060300123e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283612,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adelaide Cannon","original_name":"Adelaide Cannon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540059b4c3a368436600149a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559561,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Wilfred Buckland","original_name":"Wilfred Buckland","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540059c8c3a368436300144c","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9064,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Adrian","original_name":"Adrian","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":"/7T9PaMDMuoUOBQzk9QRgdciYjZQ.jpg","credit_id":"540059dac3a368436c0013fa","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Burns","original_name":"Roy Burns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540059ecc3a3680603001245","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39798,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucien N.
