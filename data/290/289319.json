Fabian Gibbs plays a black Montreal college student forced to leave school when his girlfriend Pat Dillon becomes pregnant. Gibbs resents this interruption in his plans, but he becomes a very good provider. The responsibilities of parenthood, alas, irreparably damage the boy-girl relationship. Filmed in a quasidocumentary manner, Sitting in Limbo seems predestined to win film festival awards--as indeed it has.","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":"/enrpWFB69MHyuJjjwOp0Z357VSi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sitting in Limbo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian Gibbs","original_name":"Fabian Gibbs","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Fabian","credit_id":"65679ac8021cee00ada75f97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Dillon-Moore","original_name":"Patricia Dillon-Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pat","credit_id":"65679ad8e72fe800c679abb9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Grant","original_name":"Debbie Grant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Debbie","credit_id":"65679b003d745400ea278f33","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Clarke","original_name":"Sylvie Clarke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sylvie","credit_id":"65679b1ba8b2ca010bc1dbd3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John N.
