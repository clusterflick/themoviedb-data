And this kitty's not so cool he can't get a little scared, like when he, Jon and Odie discover that a closed-down haunted house is really open, or that leftovers occasionally ran rampant in the fridge. Garfield has a big imagination, too, as you'll see when he imagines himself as a fish or a werewolf, or even Jon for a day!  There's much more to the fat cat's story, so grab some pasta, flop on the couch and tune in for some cat-toon fun with Garfield!","popularity":1.1938,"poster_path":"/k6Pw8SjESyINoGHgKe4IcCD9p88.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3635,"logo_path":"/e4dCQJpJjwL46i1WuGpTIO3srL6.png","name":"20th Century Fox Home
