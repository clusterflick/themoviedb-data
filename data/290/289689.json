Alvin wants to be accepted into the Monster Club to get their cool Monster jacket, but the Monster members think it s cool to be cruel. It takes Theodore s friendship with Michael, a misunderstood outcast the other kids call Pumpkinhead, to show Alvin that being a true friend is really a lot more cool than trying to be a popular Monster! There are plenty of laughs and surprises -- and music, including the Chipmunks rendition of the hit song Monster Mash -- to make this a monstrously fun video any time of the year!","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/uGW3oKhm5VEQosgWWki2sCkZ7cN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Halloween Collection","video":true,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uGW3oKhm5VEQosgWWki2sCkZ7cN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
