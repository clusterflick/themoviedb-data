Serving as the right hand man of Patrick Keller (Chad Sheveland), the second most powerful crime lord in Chicago, Daniel has assisted Patrick into the power and status that he holds. However, when an unexpected double cross occurs during the assassination of a well-known council leader, Daniel finds himself the prime target of the fearsome Madame Lo (Allison Carvalho), leader of the triads. After finding out that Patrick approved the hit on him, Daniel is left stunned and angered. Confused, betrayed, and left with no explanation, Daniel must confront old friends and past demons, while questioning his own creed to find out who he can trust, why he was double crossed, and to ultimately find the reason of his existence.","popularity":0.2148,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Go To Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Ukena","original_name":"Matt Ukena","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ricardo Contreras","credit_id":"58bb57b9c3a368515d00ec2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Sheveland","original_name":"Chad Sheveland","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Patrick Keller","credit_id":"58bb57cb925141608402c663","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Ruel","original_name":"Dennis Ruel","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/gAd92nk2WCaXpSpY82aAhdqD4Zs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tarik Yousif","credit_id":"58bb57db925141607702c4f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Manzanares","original_name":"Emmanuel Manzanares","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":"/euR7pMCI08WLXC2mGG3R61mR07R.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roberto Aguilar","credit_id":"58bb57f4925141126a00e3b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Jacobus","original_name":"Eric Jacobus","popularity":0.2723,"profile_path":"/thlkGvfESBgkwaihPlivXt76N5j.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jonny Costello","credit_id":"58bb5804c3a36851cd00eae8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Fung Min-Hang","original_name":"馮勉恆","popularity":0.247,"profile_path":"/8g1rYgcwEvLn7WNpdMDlBGQeCWR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"William Chen","credit_id":"58bb581e925141126a00e406","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Drechsler-Martell","original_name":"Paul Drechsler-Martell","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eric Matherson","credit_id":"58bb582e925141609e02a243","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Carvalho","original_name":"Allison Carvalho","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Madame Gillian Lo","credit_id":"58bb583e925141609b02b217","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Bernal","original_name":"Shawn Bernal","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Daniel Vicente","credit_id":"58bb5850925141606b02ce2a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197361,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leo Kei Angelos","original_name":"Leo Kei Angelos","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Joseph Train","credit_id":"619ccd19c0ae36008914c84d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197361,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leo Kei Angelos","original_name":"Leo Kei Angelos","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ccf606636270062787dfa","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Manzanares","original_name":"Emmanuel Manzanares","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":"/euR7pMCI08WLXC2mGG3R61mR07R.jpg","credit_id":"58bb5879c3a36851cd00eb93","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Manzanares","original_name":"Emmanuel Manzanares","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":"/euR7pMCI08WLXC2mGG3R61mR07R.jpg","credit_id":"58bb5871925141607702c5d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2175993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
