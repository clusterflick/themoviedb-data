An important figure in the history of Canadian Indigenous filmmaking, Gil Cardinal was born to a Métis mother but raised by a non-Indigenous foster family, and with this auto-biographical documentary he charts his efforts to find his biological mother and to understand why he was removed from her. Considered a milestone in documentary cinema, it addressed the country’s internal colonialism in a profoundly personal manner, winning a Special Jury Prize at Banff and multiple international awards.","popularity":1.8962,"poster_path":"/3LAXDceokajNdm16juhYtGTD6Tr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foster Child","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gil Cardinal","original_name":"Gil Cardinal","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58c19394c3a368263d00b6f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Cardinal","original_name":"Don Cardinal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58c1939e925141734f00c1de","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jim Jeffrey","original_name":"Jim Jeffrey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc5b258566d20098b1fa5c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773058,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Bibby","original_name":"Alan Bibby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c19414c3a368265800b2c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773057,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Radford","original_name":"Tom Radford","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c193e9925141734f00c22d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gil Cardinal","original_name":"Gil Cardinal","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c194a49251411db300720f","department":"Editing","job":"Associate Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773063,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerald K.
