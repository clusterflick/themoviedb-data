This film thus allows us to hear with pleasure words that break with cultural gossip, that question and throw light – a verb, a man that resist here and now. We learn a great deal from it, whether or not we are familiar with Straub-Huillet’s work. Tell Me Something tells us a story, or stories. Stories about cinema, stories about faithfulness and honesty. The story, also, of the setting up of a people rising against ruling state of things. The story, moreover, of an irreparable absence – that of Danièle Huillet. In short, the story of a filmmaker in winter, and of an international community that is enlightened in the darkness.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87451,"logo_path":null,"name":"AL Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":87450,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Maison du doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Me Something","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58bed079925141606b06590a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Lafosse","original_name":"Philippe Lafosse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bed04392514132a2016fbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Lafosse","original_name":"Philippe Lafosse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bed04cc3a36866a505ecfb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
