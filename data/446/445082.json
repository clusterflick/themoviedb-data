I most expected Hollis Frampton (because of 'Zorns Lemma') to pick up the challenge; but he never did. In some sense I think composer Corner has – and now we have this dance of riddles as music and film combine to make ‘passage,’ in every sense of the word, further possible.” –S.B.","popularity":0.172,"poster_path":"/ay9vEdYkOqLH8yS7iJNTV0btwgl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passage Through: A Ritual","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Corner","original_name":"Philip Corner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b7a571f44f2700e5375a20","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"58bb840c925141607302ec22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277945","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ay9vEdYkOqLH8yS7iJNTV0btwgl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"(World premiere) Museum of the Moving Image","release_date":"1991-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film was completed in July 1990, dated as such by the artist.","release_date":"1990-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
