When villainous lumberman Frenchy Duvalle refuses to limit his wood-chopping activities, he inadvertently touches off a forest fire. Trapped in the middle of the conflagration, Frenchy's only hope for rescue is mountie Tom Jeffries, presently scouring the countryside in his scout plane. Jeffries' reasons for bringing Frenchy out safely are twofold: he must deliver the renegade lumberjack to the authorities, and he happens to be in love with Frenchy's sister Betty.","popularity":0.7474,"poster_path":"/6aMlij14wPtSvsyOyman8Gqn0yw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A DOUBLE-STARRED OUTDOOR SHOW...OUTDOING ALL OTHERS FOR ACTION, DRAMA AND THRILLS","title":"The Royal Mounted Patrol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Starrett","original_name":"Charles Starrett","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/7DhidPyO8Z3regVeobzhRcbqlZT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Jeffries","credit_id":"58bc4e83c3a368668f035b4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Hayden","original_name":"Russell Hayden","popularity":0.2608,"profile_path":"/2bHCudsHfVVTdVoijrz55OiwpU7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lucky Lawrence","credit_id":"58bc4e8f925141606b0410c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda McKay","original_name":"Wanda McKay","popularity":0.2278,"profile_path":"/ifZpy75FH8o0o1paoVAukStI5xu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Betty Duvalle","credit_id":"58bc4e9ac3a368664d03e423","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Curtis","original_name":"Donald Curtis","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/2VrI2eZXGhESrx9E5EuAbGtqkFF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frenchy Duvalle","credit_id":"58bc4ea7c3a36866a503bcf6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Bridges","original_name":"Lloyd Bridges","popularity":1.0226,"profile_path":"/3dUJhLyaOl32mOU9HBpgTniLNJc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hap Andrews","credit_id":"58bc4eb3925141608404096f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Thomas","original_name":"Evan Thomas","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Commander","credit_id":"58bc4ec1925141609e03d675","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Adams","original_name":"Ted Adams","popularity":0.3558,"profile_path":"/8nlghnRT63ETMDqSSAfXYlLE9N7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"58bc4ed092514160840409ac","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Greene","original_name":"Harrison Greene","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Office manager","credit_id":"58bc4edcc3a36866a503bd50","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kermit Maynard","original_name":"Kermit Maynard","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/zwP78rIGvc3JKGuqhzZdodU9FfT.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sgt.
