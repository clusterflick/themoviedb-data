Assistant cameraman Jean-Paul Toraille toyed around, so to speak, with his first video camera, filming the daily work on the set. Now, 24 years later, he was joined by Jean-Marie Straub in editing the material into a film. Anyone who expected the shooting of Les Avatars de la mort d’Empédocle to be an austere affair, an exercise entirely devoid of humour or a Straubian tour de force is proven wrong: so much lightness, joy, concentration, spells of waiting for the sun to come out – and even proper slapstick in between – is hard to find.","popularity":0.216,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les avatars de la mort d’Empédocle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58becbde9251413407016709","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Baratta","original_name":"Vladimir Baratta","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"58becbef9251416077064a8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Berger","original_name":"William Berger","popularity":0.4667,"profile_path":"/cUini28DU4yIAalJ1QbAn452LIR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"58becbf7c3a368668f0551f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Baratta","original_name":"Martina Baratta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"58becbffc3a368668f0551ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renato Berta","original_name":"Renato Berta","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/fXjRoyeehudjs0kqsMv5yBt7b0U.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"58becc08925141126a046d3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075414,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Louis Hochet","original_name":"Louis Hochet","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"58becc1292514132a2016a93","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Huillet","original_name":"Danièle Huillet","popularity":0.2084,"profile_path":"/cFbsXcombzamJjtdDOWDl2UzUHY.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"592b4b8e9251413b5b068c94","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","original_name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58becbb2925141343501620b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","original_name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58becbc8c3a368668f0551ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","original_name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58becbabc3a36866a505e68b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","original_name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58becbc19251416077064a5a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":551787,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Quesemand","original_name":"Catherine Quesemand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58becbd2925141606b065359","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","original_name":"Jean-Paul Toraille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58becbb9c3a368663005c4fe","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1720145","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
