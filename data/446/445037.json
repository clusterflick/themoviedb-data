These men chase him away and warn him never to return or to tell anyone about them. Soon, however, they locate him and summon him back, because he has unknowingly given them a clue vital to their quest and they need his help to unravel the rest of the mystery. If he can do so, they will find buried pirate treasure and all become rich. But in joining the search, he falls under the same obsession and curse -- an ominous fate suggested by the unearthly electronic music which contributes to the film's atmosphere.","popularity":1.3653,"poster_path":"/qhVawlnLTs3t7ONYTo1yV5o4k0J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highgate Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gold Bug","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"ABC Weekend Specials: The Gold Bug","type":"series title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberts Blossom","original_name":"Roberts Blossom","popularity":0.5397,"profile_path":"/CP19Dvjvx2xSrkyJQEdmAC4wug.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mr. LeGrand","credit_id":"58bb084892514160730274ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Holder","original_name":"Geoffrey Holder","popularity":0.2139,"profile_path":"/ncS1CTgCKEChpu73VCNWrtYp7Xx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jupiter","credit_id":"58bb0860c3a368668f021604","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Michael Hall","original_name":"Anthony Michael Hall","popularity":2.02,"profile_path":"/nLthzoCuNxxd3KteIrnnMg1066G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Boy","credit_id":"58bb0879c3a36851cd00a241","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Moberly","original_name":"Robert Moberly","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Uncle","credit_id":"58bb08949251416084028226","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sudie Bond","original_name":"Sudie Bond","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/yTPywMNctmFSTemPsFUyi4Yezbj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Agnes","credit_id":"58bb08b2925141607b0273cd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Haney","original_name":"Anne Haney","popularity":0.5854,"profile_path":"/yb2RVcI5JLlFlT5wLVa8XNvnbAL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jessica Bessop","credit_id":"58bb08cbc3a368515d00a42d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alix Elias","original_name":"Alix Elias","popularity":0.2876,"profile_path":"/iYSeDJdMqZG6F0unFXUpzRLiDfF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Barmaid","credit_id":"58bb08e4c3a36851cd00a284","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Bruns","original_name":"Philip Bruns","popularity":0.3644,"profile_path":"/jogGxPsyoU3ofLXZwpaAxTGE5NI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tattoo","credit_id":"58bb08fb925141607b0273f8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969213,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Barth","original_name":"Robert Barth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fd0eba848eb900494db5be","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgar Allan Poe","original_name":"Edgar Allan Poe","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/AlgddAgqBWRZUNHtX2Rue60HSIg.jpg","credit_id":"652ae1d7f2883802a00a5105","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fuest","original_name":"Robert Fuest","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/w7wmTbPWYL7vkrF0ZNVBJDhOVYW.jpg","credit_id":"58bb0921925141608402827a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward Pomerantz","original_name":"Edward Pomerantz","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bb0952c3a36851cd00a2cf","department":"Writing","job":"Teleplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50520,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Gross","original_name":"Charles Gross","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bb097f92514160840282ab","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71044,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dennis M.
