In a first section, amongst shots of clouds, swirls and darkness, it referred to the origin of life. (...) After the launch of a rocket and images about exploring space, the film shows a woman naked in the country. The camera makes a slow tilt down of her body. When passing by the pubis, the camera follows a drop of blood that slides by the leg. When it reaches the floor, a parade of miniature war tanks appear, red, like the ones previously shown. The film ends with a sign that says 'But you can also give birth to nothing'.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":"/teB3Pxn94fsYBuqAiQghkt9sJDL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1972-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La segunda primera matriz","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo Gurrola","original_name":"Alfredo Gurrola","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/cF7kuipAv1M4MldprpjkvIzb6mz.jpg","credit_id":"5aee04b292514119b9000018","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/teB3Pxn94fsYBuqAiQghkt9sJDL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1972-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
