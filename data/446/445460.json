PRISONERS OF THE WAR ON DRUGS reveals life behind bars in the nationâ€™s prisons. Each prisoner has his or her own story, but for most, the story is predictably similar; they have been criminalized for drugs or drug related offenses, locked up with easy access to substances, and given little opportunity for rehabilitation.  This film provides an inside look at the prison system, its prisoners and a war on drugs we do not seem to be winning.","popularity":0.4871,"poster_path":"/wdPaIqEz0AnWqUjXI9w6qt6aaHP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72835,"logo_path":"/aZUTs6FuZWKrHSq9koIIsqKo0Wv.png","name":"Blowback Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prisoners of the War on Drugs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jones","original_name":"Michael Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58bdf143c3a368668604a786","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Al Levin","original_name":"Al Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bdf0b7c3a3680d68006125","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84389,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daphne Pinkerson","original_name":"Daphne Pinkerson","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/c4zJ7i3Sfs9LyA0qpWEmmuDS10.jpg","credit_id":"58bdf0c6c3a368668f04761c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"58bdf0e692514134350067a8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248973,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Benjamin","original_name":"Mark Benjamin","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bdf0f492514132a20069a8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Ellwood","original_name":"Alison Ellwood","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/ppX49WUhA8aJTONTFFqC7i0jHa2.jpg","credit_id":"58bdf105c3a3680df8006726","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172311,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shane McConnell","original_name":"Shane McConnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bdf11592514160840550fd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Levin","original_name":"Marc Levin","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/mlqZhmWcZ403kyvTgKdLDCMMaj2.jpg","credit_id":"5c9fdb26c3a3687352822a9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Levin","original_name":"Marc Levin","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/mlqZhmWcZ403kyvTgKdLDCMMaj2.jpg","credit_id":"5c9fdb340e0a265989f94b30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0272256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wdPaIqEz0AnWqUjXI9w6qt6aaHP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":1601,"name":"war on drugs"},{"id":9890,"name":"jail"},{"id":156117,"name":"illegal drugs"},{"id":233317,"name":"prison industrial complex"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
