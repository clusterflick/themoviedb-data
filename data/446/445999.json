Williams found salvation by doing the one thing he loved most: hitting baseballs. In his rookie season with the Red Sox, where he would spend his entire career as a player, Williams batted .327, socked 31 homers and led the league with 145 RBI.  Over the next 21 years, despite losing five seasons of his prime to active service as a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, Williams hit 521 home runs, twice captured the Triple Crown, and became the oldest man ever to win a batting title. He finished his career with a .344 lifetime batting average, was the last man to hit over .400 in a full season, batting .406 in 1941, and was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame.","popularity":0.9359,"poster_path":"/c61J2CmnDVemAEDwyNTSpmKOng0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6751,"logo_path":"/giPzzhPdiNloiuwo7qLagRn5uGH.png","name":"HBO Sports","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There Goes the Greatest Hitter That Ever Lived","title":"Ted Williams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ted Williams: There Goes the Greatest Hitter That Ever Lived","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Williams","original_name":"Claudia Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58c19db5925141731a00c635","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Redford","original_name":"Robert Redford","popularity":1.7409,"profile_path":"/hNiy78lk26xTE6tjisSCowcOVw0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58c19e12c3a3687e00008400","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liev Schreiber","original_name":"Liev Schreiber","popularity":2.5942,"profile_path":"/gTHvDnTN52iTdnQPVPu6LhirUHc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ab6f9739251413964012aa9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Williams","original_name":"Ted Williams","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/AoUJDltT9rVgRRZmjIkBrsgxh3u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5c7423f20e0a262c1f81a129","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Cohen","original_name":"Aaron Cohen","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62976f2bd48cee2c4633ce1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Cohen","original_name":"Aaron Cohen","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62976f44ca83541353b6c9c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49819,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Updike","original_name":"John Updike","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/icjw4pgAvtGuKt5NF0jYCU6TS8.jpg","credit_id":"62976f3709ed8f0cee21c414","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773097,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret Grossi","original_name":"Margaret Grossi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c19da1925141732700c793","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1247518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Carillo","original_name":"Mary Carillo","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/h5elJgaqpPxobbbZVm4ixf6NQ8G.jpg","credit_id":"58c19dd2c3a3687da800768a","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1471847","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gYKgxhFvMtER7Eedd6eEpUnlEu0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/akmR998fRcDbYzOSeISP8eys3Um.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c61J2CmnDVemAEDwyNTSpmKOng0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":233528,"name":"america's past time"},{"id":233529,"name":"batting average"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
