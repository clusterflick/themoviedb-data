This mockumentary is based on archival footage and told at the first person (the voice of the French president is provided by imitator Didier Gustin). The main comic effect comes from the contradictions between the various speeches of the French President. The title comes from the title of the French-language version of Being John Malkovich.","popularity":0.5767,"poster_path":"/ylJaVybZjvOliJaXvCYLdlJLqK8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66331,"logo_path":"/n2gAOEA4q6bUiaHwo2mKWHGA1wm.png","name":"Bonne Pioche","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When reality is worst than fiction.","title":"Being Jacques Chirac","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dans la peau de Jacques Chirac","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"En la piel de Jacques Chirac","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Chirac","original_name":"Jacques Chirac","popularity":0.2219,"profile_path":"/c0ckSdaB4IurFscsfF1VUzLOEvI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4426c3a368484e012603","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Blair","original_name":"Tony Blair","popularity":0.2671,"profile_path":"/8d2ImyiI2fNSFW365FHsSmsfDvW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e15dc219020120015bd8404","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George W.
