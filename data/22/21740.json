The film features spectacular land forms, diverse wildlife and the people and cultures indigenous to these places. Distinct geographic places include the great island of Madagascar, home to unique limestone pinnacles and the playful lemur; and the greatest desert—the Namib—home of the largest sand dunes in the world that tower majestically over its western border, the Atlantic Ocean. Other locations featured are the great icecap of Greenland, Iguazu Falls in Brazil, the Okavango Delta in Botswana, the Chang Tang Plateau in Tibet, and the Amazon River in South America.","popularity":0.1897,"poster_path":"/p5vFEOaN3vC7y3Y70swzK9WR3e1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3447,"logo_path":"/yBdvUlunhXyUowuy0XaEPuBtYTo.png","name":"IMAX","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
