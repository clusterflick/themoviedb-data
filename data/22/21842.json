She is married to a lazy husband and has four children, all named after her favorite Swedish Eurovision popstars. Her brother is a crossdressing guy self-titled \"Candy Darling\". Mona works in a retirement home for disabled people, where she is responsible for taking care of a young man named David who suffers a movement-restricting disease forcing him into a wheelchair. David's parents have abandoned him, as they wanted a normal child. Mona holds a big place in David's heart, and vica versa. David's goal is to get his parents to come and visit him, and he wants to show them that he is a great person, despite his handicap. Therefore he works with music on his computer, and his goal is to create a song, send it to \"The Cardigans\", a famous Swedish band and have them play the song and credit him, hoping his parents would spot it and want to visit him.","popularity":2.1197,"poster_path":"/9VwP8fMxTVErL4w5SUdPfe6cMCz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":327,"logo_path":"/vodjjKlAbwGeERPjrAhxZMBGPUc.png","name":"Nordisk
