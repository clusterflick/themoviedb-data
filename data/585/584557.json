This is the principle of the operation proposed on 16 July 2011 by the Opéra de Lyon. The representation that was played on his stage was broadcast simultaneously and outdoors in thirteen Rhône-Alpes cities including Ambérieu-en-Bugey, Valence and Grenoble. Thousands of spectators were able to attend a free version of the opera \"Cosi fan tutte\".  It is Adrian Noble who signs the mise-en-scene of this umpteenth production of the famous masterpiece, a joke on the banter that will turn to drama. The American made a bold choice by transposing the plot to a beach in California . The idea came to him during a stay in Santa Monica: the skaters on the sidewalk made him think of the characters Ferrando and Guglielmo who play with their lovers.","popularity":0.0601,"poster_path":"/aCoKHfwiGRQnqnj10fFYCJ28HdS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosi Fan Tutte - Lyon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Lhote","original_name":"Lionel Lhote","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73b3f40e0a262c0980bc46","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Behle","original_name":"Daniel Behle","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/8v95IV99Lgf7u9tBQxMY14xTLSZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73b3fe9251415ee6b5c834","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vito Priante","original_name":"Vito Priante","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/4DdT3wlpfKUYuThNskywp41AjhZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73b406c3a3685a321867b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bengtsson","original_name":"Maria Bengtsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nNyUsGPJRmneVDcOxbqZT6UYWw8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73b412c3a3685a4018af6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tove Dahlberg","original_name":"Tove Dahlberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73b41a0e0a262c0f80d7e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Galitskava","original_name":"Elena Galitskava","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73b423c3a3685a49181770","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Noble","original_name":"Adrian Noble","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c73b4349251415eecb606f8","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aCoKHfwiGRQnqnj10fFYCJ28HdS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zOumzTeX9NWeOugc0oCvUaysSe5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
