At that time, following a decision made by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, all-out preparations for an uprising are under way. The central characters are real historical figures representing two antagonistic camps. The film chronicles a series of dramatic events: secret underground meetings, actions of the combat groups and the partisans, strikes and mass rallies, the last attempts of the regime to hold on to power. The film recreates the atmosphere on the eve of the uprising, which culminated in the main thrust: the seizure of the Defense Ministry in Sofia on the night before September 9.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":"/zp7urskfgEur4rEVj6im3DWH64F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115443,"logo_path":null,"name":"AAVC","origin_country":""},{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1981-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Udarat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyubomir Mladenov","original_name":"Lyubomir Mladenov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Zhelyo","credit_id":"5c7526f90e0a260b4919d2f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kosta Tsonev","original_name":"Коста Цонев","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/bWKrVCVbb45rdw7A3SRPlGaZ14R.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prince Kiril","credit_id":"5c752705c3a3684829d2d62f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Yanchev","original_name":"Ivan Yanchev","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"General Mihov","credit_id":"5c752713925141688e53ad80","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yordan Spirov","original_name":"Yordan Spirov","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bay Kosta","credit_id":"5c7527220e0a260b4e19edaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stoyan Stoev","original_name":"Stoyan Stoev","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Muraviev","credit_id":"5c752730925141689553a71e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Lukanov","original_name":"Boris Lukanov","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"General Marinov","credit_id":"5c752742925141688953aff5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikolay Nikiforov","original_name":"Nikolay Nikiforov","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c752676925141688953af5b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Borislav Sharaliev","original_name":"Borislav Sharaliev","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/qxyF4Owf26GLlbWbOgK0jeUoYoK.jpg","credit_id":"5c752659c3a3684834d2db84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0357260","wikidata_id":"Q12297176","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zp7urskfgEur4rEVj6im3DWH64F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
