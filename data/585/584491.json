Based on a multi-character narrative structure, the film re-interprets the velocity, prime-time, rebellion, physical pleasure and ethical minefield referred to in these plays. With its Dream-like images, The Walker reminds us of the utopia pictured previously by the Taiwan Walker Theatre, indicating a polysemous, hybridized art world whose components range from the sublime to the ridiculous.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2017-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Walker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2796449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wu Kun-da","original_name":"Wu Kun-da","popularity":0.1647,"profile_path":"/gKbA5qwLoO8yw3m2PKy4yeQ3gXP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5faa2c2a72c13e003f764b95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5199709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuan-Ching Liao","original_name":"廖原慶","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/kO4IYnsjS6CMZRy6vPXIwkAhL7z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67c1abffc93271491f35c6d7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2185992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Hui-yu","original_name":"Su Hui-yu","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/rqHYpADSluIt96JC4u74MQQTccK.jpg","credit_id":"5c7310f39251415eecb48f86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8457254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
