These phenomena evoke familiar images such as shadows or reflections on a water surface; but also unusual ones like the \"Brocken spectre\" or the pinhole effect during a solar eclipse. These ancient and natural projections can be considered as precultural and independent of any apparatus. They occured even before mankind and are united by their intangible, ephemeral presence. In their immateriality and fragility, they are precursors of the cinema image. UMBRA develops a visual dialogue between phenomenon and apparatus, archetype and image, self and self-perception.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/mAgamgAkPndCS2udOVh2c0MBln9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115939,"logo_path":null,"name":"RosenPictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umbra","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Krell","original_name":"Johannes Krell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c731583c3a3685a44174906","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Fischer","original_name":"Florian Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c73158ec3a3685a40171a53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Fischer","original_name":"Florian Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8c01679251410cf7c57e22","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Krell","original_name":"Johannes Krell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8c016fc3a36805f30d34c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9902408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7VETTLV6sywOLYQELkkjPhKjSQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mAgamgAkPndCS2udOVh2c0MBln9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dddrK0IIFNCCylgn3uJauBQ0uEZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
