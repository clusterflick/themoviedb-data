They are preparing a film based on the former’s autobiography, “Tout s’est bien passé” (Everything Went Fine). In it, she tells how her father asked her to “end it” in the wake of a heart attack. Cavalier suggests that she plays herself, and that he plays her father. One winter morning, Emmanuèle calls Alain; they will have to postpone the shoot until the spring, as she needs an urgent operation.","popularity":0.2295,"poster_path":"/7CpMf6ofjaN8aRwhHgkLbJ21FwM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caméra
