See a handful of world-class riders demonstrate the latest innovations in street, mountain and trials unicycling. Defect combines groundbreaking filmmaking with a fresh soundtrack and bonus rider commentary, to showcase the skills and personalities of this rapidly emerging sport.  Highly technical and highly entertaining, this video features some gee-whiz riding that will make you wince many times. Dan Heaton's skill as a filmmaker is as outrageous as his riding.  Released on DVD in 2005, Defect became the most popular full-length unicycle highlight film to date. Building on the street and trials riding featured in previous films (UNiVERsE - 2000, UNiVERsE 2 - 2004), it also introduced the beginnings of flat-land unicycling.","popularity":0.1122,"poster_path":"/2MFdHSuk92ZNPAFjSI3lXJYWdUB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syko Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"New from the makers of Universe and Universe 2: Dan Heaton of Syko Productions introduces Defect, the DVD.","title":"Defect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Heaton","original_name":"Dan Heaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c71913c9251415eddb133b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kris Holm","original_name":"Kris Holm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c71917e0e0a262c0c7b6529","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Atkins","original_name":"Ryan Atkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c719187c3a3685a3c136cc2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Groves","original_name":"Jeff Groves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c719196c3a3685a4c130fa2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Collos","original_name":"Xavier Collos","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c71919f9251415ee8b1166b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabin Arditty","original_name":"Sabin Arditty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191a89251415ef1b10e0c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Lundgren","original_name":"Brian Lundgren","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191b19251415eecb12903","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Clark","original_name":"Mike Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191bb0e0a262c117b81dc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zack Baldwin","original_name":"Zack Baldwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191c70e0a262c0f7b9fb9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaori Matsuzawa","original_name":"Kaori Matsuzawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191d19251415ee2b1083a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin McMullin","original_name":"Kevin McMullin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191dd0e0a262c1c7b84e2","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Johanneson","original_name":"Shaun Johanneson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191ed0e0a262c067b6a3e","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keaton Miller","original_name":"Keaton Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7191f7c3a3685a35137298","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Heaton","original_name":"Dan Heaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c719219c3a3685a3e1377d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1467,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2MFdHSuk92ZNPAFjSI3lXJYWdUB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1033}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":281180,"name":"unicycle"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Defect Trailer","key":"rhA-hrkPkkY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2007-02-08T03:13:50.000Z","id":"60bce803244182007abf169c"}]}}}
