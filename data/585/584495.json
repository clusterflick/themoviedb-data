The small and inconspicuous island of Nauru with close to 10,000 inhabitants lies in the Pacific at a great distance to the mainland. But Nauru is a tragic place steeped in history that has been overwritten by numerous narratives. The film addresses these different narratives, starting with the early exploitation of the island and its calcite and phosphate deposits by the colonial powers in the 19th century. After the golden 1970s, when the »Birdshit island« was flush with money, the phosphate was completely mined and the island state soon became insolvent. Since then, Nauru has turned into a gloomy place: 80% of the area is uninhabitable; the attempt to tap new sources of income led to the wide-scale practice of money laundering.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8f8hXq4yvjwuOGDb63Z4ApxeD8X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67822,"logo_path":null,"name":"sixpackfilm","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anubumin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Ressler","original_name":"Oliver Ressler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8s9eErrGWAQT0u9LF38RNvof5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"5c7313129251415ef1b48ae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2127091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zanny Begg","original_name":"Zanny Begg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/79sZNhX29jVlM1jpEWs89p2v2hY.jpg","credit_id":"5c7312fb0e0a262c117f2680","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8f8hXq4yvjwuOGDb63Z4ApxeD8X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
