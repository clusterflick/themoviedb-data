Magic alone can unravel this knot of destinies... And then, there is the Gypsy tale of the black swallow and how it came to be.","popularity":0.1673,"poster_path":"/8wDnUrFujztZqbiA7EYXNBVwR0e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radiovision Plus","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":16135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Globe Film","origin_country":""},{"id":77258,"logo_path":null,"name":"47ème Parallèle","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1997-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Swallow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Chernata lyastovitza","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Black Swallow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'hirondelle noire","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Το μαύρο χελιδόνι","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Fekete fecske","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liubov Liubcheva","original_name":"Liubov Liubcheva","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/ssHdyLOPqbzWDG8mYNSZgHHPI0J.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Magdalena","credit_id":"62701494cb71b813f802c14d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2292645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tzvetan Alexiev","original_name":"Tzvetan Alexiev","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":"/ebWAXrPlGZjtnL6y3AqBp0RoyWT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Halibriamov","credit_id":"627014a87cffda73180f5836","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191671,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Georgi Bogdanov","original_name":"Georgi Bogdanov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kanyo","credit_id":"627014d26f53e11b4d1a6b83","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivaylo Hristov","original_name":"Ivaylo Hristov","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/gS9mmPcdczVqBVseLdKMvsiCyqU.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Lilianin","credit_id":"67b4bfeb4e89ccd7886e27de","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434966,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claude Reznik","original_name":"Claude Reznik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6270151ba24c50393a1cfd74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533558,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nikolina Momchilova","original_name":"Nikolina Momchilova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627014f5c74eba2e0b290be3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769299,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bozhidar Petkov","original_name":"Bozhidar Petkov","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3a16628d7fe008c513671","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Radoslav Spassov","original_name":"Radoslav Spassov","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3a15d43501100ef5e38f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgi Djulgerov","original_name":"Georgi Djulgerov","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/5OVF1oUgN1DRpx4azSDVNT0sx5P.jpg","credit_id":"5c74223d9251415ee2b6bf03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgi Djulgerov","original_name":"Georgi Djulgerov","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/5OVF1oUgN1DRpx4azSDVNT0sx5P.jpg","credit_id":"5c7421e00e0a262c1181981d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Svetoslav Ovcharov","original_name":"Svetoslav Ovcharov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7422489251415ee2b6bf1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0186209","wikidata_id":"Q12299108","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4OsZlrUx3xU2O5ZU55XyCy2pZD4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"bg","file_path":"/8wDnUrFujztZqbiA7EYXNBVwR0e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15190,"name":"gipsy"},{"id":266985,"name":"gipsy culture"},{"id":275694,"name":"bg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
