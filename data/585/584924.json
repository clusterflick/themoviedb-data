His first son is married, while his second son, Kedarnath, who suffered a head injury, is a little senile, and his third son, Amarnath, is a brilliant student. Amarnath falls in love with Beeni Mukherjee, a good student with an elder dominating sister, Saraswati, who is brilliant. Kedar is attracted to Saraswati but lacks the courage to approach her. Then some of his friends introduce him as a brilliant student and athlete to Saraswati's dad, who approves of him. Kedar meets with Saraswati, who also approves of him, and both are slowly drawn to each other. It will not be long before Saraswati finds out that Kedarnath is a fraud, will give up on him, and will get ready to marry a wealthy Bhagalpur-based man of her father's choice.","popularity":0.2991,"poster_path":"/buaBAnbhpsQv48fK8ambZYXiWMU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ram Cine Arts","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1980-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dadar Kirti","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tapas Paul","original_name":"Tapas Paul","popularity":0.2798,"profile_path":"/zkyQnGyagQlfGVBCRFP9yOEcBXA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kedarnath","credit_id":"5c7577dbc3a368483cd39751","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahua Roy Chowdhury","original_name":"Mahua Roy Chowdhury","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/daRECdZYE3hK7Px2p6oRNlGcD9M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Saraswati Mukherjee","credit_id":"5c7577fb0e0a260b521a7b00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1013093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debashree Roy","original_name":"Debashree Roy","popularity":0.2384,"profile_path":"/gx61hgszdK06vqR7P4GLF3PGQQN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Beeni Mukherjee","credit_id":"61e3eaf1f5c8240042906640","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1094825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kali Bannerjee","original_name":"Kali Bannerjee","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/uUz3Lk0NhxlhhKG51VjvrITUZ52.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Father of Saraswati & Beena","credit_id":"6318b66f40d0fe0099bbafee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruma Guha Thakurta","original_name":"Ruma Guha Thakurta","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/bqXjSOwP5gPaYXsALwFANpSKsYX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mother of Saraswati & Beena","credit_id":"6318b68146e75f007e417643","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anup Kumar","original_name":"Anup Kumar","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/rumDvpYQUYZUmCOe1EYx0m2Kaew.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bhombolda (Head of Chandobani Club)","credit_id":"6318b69522931a007a7798ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2373040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satya Bandopadhyay","original_name":"Satya Bandopadhyay","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/szLY3PLNZVLT6EV3DRl0Qm1edCR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Santu's Father","credit_id":"631ea4aa9c24fc0091e2a473","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayan Banerjee","original_name":"Ayan Banerjee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Amarnath 'Amar' N.
