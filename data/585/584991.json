Absorbed in their feelings Vladko and Aneto have nothing to do with those events. Things at Aneto's big wealthy home look very different from Vladko's small house huddled in the yard. Kiril, Vladko's elder brother, is anxious about Vladko who should have been at the rally, but is writing poetry instead. Aneto and Vladko are happily dancing at the school-leavers' ball. Kiril has killed a German officer. The ball breaks out. Aneto has disappeared in the confusion. Vladko goes to look after her. A group of people armed with clubs and knuckle-dusters beat him cruelly because he is Kiril's brother. Kiril has joined the partisans. Vladko is seriously ill and dies. Kiril and his comrades continue the struggle.","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":"/5c3k9s6oSx6jCRZJoYhb3haILyi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana
