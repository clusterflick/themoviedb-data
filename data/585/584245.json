Most of the source material was unwittingly supplied by a Chinese herbalist. To produce Arapadaptor Geyer applied a flashlight and laser, a la Man Ray, to the caterpillars, cicadas and seeds of the herbal packages. Much of the original footage was further manipulated - painted, tinted and/or bleached. Finally, the images were rephotographed, slowed, through the use of an optical printer.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arapadaptor (I Feel So)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2090143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Geyer","original_name":"Anna Geyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c71925ac3a3685a44136baf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
