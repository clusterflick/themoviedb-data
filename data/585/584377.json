Described as hilarious, complex, stupid, irritating (and 'sardonic' by one lady in Goa) the show veers in and out of the familiar and the bizarre with equal comfort. A knee-slapping head-scratching torrent of jokes, characters and self-aware comedy that successfully spent the entire budget that was available to spend on the show. Featuring six very silly live sketches, stitched together by a much sillier story about the nature of art itself and bookended by extremely silly and unnecessary opening and closing, Sketchy Behaviour is truly a work of something.","popularity":0.229,"poster_path":"/qHWrt15TMPerivsFUQg9uK81qto.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sketchy Behaviour","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1739926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanan Gill","original_name":"Kanan Gill","popularity":0.2836,"profile_path":"/hSGKLwz1T8C1IApyNMDXfTwg1mg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7274349251415ef1b2c918","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1801993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Sebastian","original_name":"Kenny Sebastian","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/aJF1K8no1uXNMO58NP12cFeskTt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee712659715ae0020a6223a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neville Shah","original_name":"Neville Shah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uW4My8fgO9MMMfgx1VXarbmwOB9.jpg","credit_id":"5c72744b0e0a262c1c7d7aea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1739926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanan Gill","original_name":"Kanan Gill","popularity":0.2836,"profile_path":"/hSGKLwz1T8C1IApyNMDXfTwg1mg.jpg","credit_id":"5f865df45a46900037f11d9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1801993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Sebastian","original_name":"Kenny Sebastian","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/aJF1K8no1uXNMO58NP12cFeskTt.jpg","credit_id":"5f865e65a8067300373ba27e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9614612","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daoeIahC0A2h5FOYzbExdM8uanS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2Su7reV7HlTY8Pf9ARLmd0we8wI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qHWrt15TMPerivsFUQg9uK81qto.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sketchy Behaviour | Official Trailer | Kanan Gill & Kenny Sebastian","key":"ls9XRXesXWo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2019-02-12T06:18:03.000Z","official":true,"id":"5c7274b50e0a262c0f7d9079"}]}}}
