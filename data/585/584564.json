She peels off the mask from a society, in the eye of the storm, that claims to be liberal and in which everyone has an opinion about everything. Secure between her four walls, she touches the darkest spots of her life- a bomb attack, a failed marriage, coping with depression. A young, modern woman in today's Israel.","popularity":0.1709,"poster_path":"/vgWA14ZxU5o0WfoXtVYvyclPNrY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beit Berl College","origin_country":""},{"id":72371,"logo_path":"/e9jTO4uAvemFH6holMC4V1SUGh4.png","name":"IFS Internationale Filmschule Köln GmbH","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamar Blumenfeld","original_name":"Tamar Blumenfeld","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c73cc0ac3a3685a3c1902a9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elinor Kolton","original_name":"Elinor Kolton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c73cc49c3a3685a491844c4","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2245216,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Hartig","original_name":"Maria Hartig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ycbpTzsYAYz9R4W8FEi6sBkL4fj.jpg","credit_id":"5c73cc3b9251415ef5b5f712","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2245216,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Hartig","original_name":"Maria Hartig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ycbpTzsYAYz9R4W8FEi6sBkL4fj.jpg","credit_id":"5c73cc31c3a3685a491844b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250138,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Till Kleinau","original_name":"Till Kleinau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c73cc639251415ee6b5f2cd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250136,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ariel Guetta","original_name":"Ariel Guetta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c73cc560e0a262c1f80d32e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Bohl","original_name":"Maximilian Bohl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c765156925141688956b7db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Bohl","original_name":"Maximilian Bohl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c765145925141688656b896","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9796694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1iBfdpwNBMjy6sNubiC3CHt8WV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.65,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vgWA14ZxU5o0WfoXtVYvyclPNrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1872}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":5598,"name":"tel aviv, israel"},{"id":252199,"name":"tamar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Special Screening","release_date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
