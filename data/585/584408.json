From family films shot by her paternal grandfather and her father between 1954 and 1998, and the diaries he wrote during his life, the director tells the story of an ordinary man whose personal memory echoes a collective memory : one of a generation bursting out of Quebec's great darkness in which freedom is also synonym of disorientation. Thus begins a dialogue marked by nostalgia, between joyful videos and tormented writings, which soon becomes universal.","popularity":0.1975,"poster_path":"/aJJbaJe2L5jFy49fP5Gb3cIVQVy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faded Photograph","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Labbé","original_name":"Patrick Labbé","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/dA9LVwp1WXStEYDCfyBKZ6al1WP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c77f7df0e0a2607fd633c18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salomé Dion-Corbeil","original_name":"Salomé Dion-Corbeil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c77f7e7c3a3681bb54d806b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanie Pelletier","original_name":"Fanie Pelletier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c77f7f692514112af66e4f3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanie Pelletier","original_name":"Fanie Pelletier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c729fd20e0a262c0c7db84e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanie Pelletier","original_name":"Fanie Pelletier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c77f813c3a3681ba74d79d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanie Pelletier","original_name":"Fanie Pelletier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c77f80992514112a766e589","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon L'Espérance","original_name":"Simon L'Espérance","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c77f844c3a3681ba14d78e8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6950282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJJbaJe2L5jFy49fP5Gb3cIVQVy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":656}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Clermont-Ferrand ISFF","release_date":"2018-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
