Rose frames her story against the backdrop of England’s Enclosure Movement, which privatized communal land and spurred violent upheavals in agrarian life.Rose models the chapters of Elspeth’s life after accounts of healers persecuted for their practices, which were considered deviant and threatening within increasingly regulated society. Weaving together the harsh realities of the rural English landscape with ghostly sprites and the ethereal forces of magic, Rose questions how our perceptions of the world, and of others, can so radically change within the fluctuating norms of society and the seismic shifts of history.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/1vX5pFwE4zFxL8sHSsIDSbIDU54.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wil-o-Wisp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1443833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Rose","original_name":"Rachel Rose","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/ec0Na1yBCHEq96lUgWZrn5tfdCh.jpg","credit_id":"5b69729c92514140540da5ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1475,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vX5pFwE4zFxL8sHSsIDSbIDU54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":983}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
