It is a powerful portrait of the fragility of fame and the cost of stardom. B-pictures have long been the spawning ground of today's and tomorrow's stars. They started the careers of Jack Nicholson and Sylvester Stallone among many others, as well as now super star directors Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich, Ron Howard and James Cameron. The film examines the evolution of starry-eyed newcomers arriving in Hollywood and discovering the harsh reality of getting into pictures.","popularity":0.8796,"poster_path":"/3J7gPSqW5WtKx2E1qX6L3hXF2rm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Only Child","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dark Side of Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ford","original_name":"Maria Ford","popularity":0.5511,"profile_path":"/6a1Q56A5411ZGlYePz4i8ADd27.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6a817592514140540f403d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Kalina","original_name":"Jon Kalina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b6a818dc3a36818990f84be","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":114696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ava Cadell","original_name":"Ava Cadell","popularity":4.108,"profile_path":"/5hLyJFqYyEMesD70q1VenOwaR4o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6a819d0e0a267ef410b8a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102429,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Corman","original_name":"Roger Corman","popularity":1.0188,"profile_path":"/wgxDlbl7ACtGvCMXZsAbEhPh0we.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6a81a992514140540f4069","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Boyle","original_name":"Lisa Boyle","popularity":0.6735,"profile_path":"/nRj7ROz2QZz93S0AGtc26a29mVb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6a81c80e0a267ef610c4a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Cyran","original_name":"Catherine Cyran","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/qtBvphHLdTrDsnvyvNoebVCqy3Q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6a81d5c3a368188810a7ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samuel Z.
