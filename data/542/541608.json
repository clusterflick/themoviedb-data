But those memories faded after their father walked out on the family 20 years ago.  And now, although Ippo’s job involves lending support to lonely clients with emotional scars, he himself has difficulty with relationships. He does not even keep in contact with his sister Honoka although they both live and work in Tokyo.  One day, Honoka returns to the family home to announce she is engaged. Ippo happens to return home at the same time. And everyone is shocked when their father shows up unannounced.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/eWJ7P0X1RiP5X83WNq68Kpru7KP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Home, My Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4183690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/blz4ZFr8k0Rt5yY2i1J6W0i0U56.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWJ7P0X1RiP5X83WNq68Kpru7KP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
