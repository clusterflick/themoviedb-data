Loud and aggressive but equally sensitive and intense. Live this bluesman to the backbone is always an event. His guitar playing is full of passion and spectacular. His voice soulful. The rhythm section, Tenny Tahamata on bass and Rob Heijne on drums, is solid, swinging and pushing Sas to great heights.‘Wandering Between Worlds’ is the first live CD (and the first live DVD) on which Heijne can be heard.  The DVD ‘Wandering Between Worlds’ features a registration of the show that Julian Sas and his comrades performed for a frantically enthusiastic audience at De Boerderij, a large venue in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. The best Julian Sas gig ever, according to connoisseurs. This, almost 2 hours long, recording includes, highlights from Julian Sas’ repertoire as well as 4 brand-new songs","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/stRcXi1KritXDjYgXZuef4nqAS3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2009-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julian Sas - Wandering Between Worlds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2104763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian sas","original_name":"Julian Sas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/6RrMVX1LBebu5zBO0aqxqPDYYg9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"All guitars and Vocals","credit_id":"5b6f34000e0a267ee515940f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2104764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenny Tahamata","original_name":"Tenny Tahamata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bassguitar","credit_id":"5b6f340ec3a36818861a8f2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2104765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Heijne","original_name":"Rob Heijne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"drums","credit_id":"5b6f3440c3a3681899149f83","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462307,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Schuurman","original_name":"Paul Schuurman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780199bed679e53f87b09f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Schuurman","original_name":"Jan Schuurman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678019fa601acfe7bd4ea12a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/stRcXi1KritXDjYgXZuef4nqAS3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246713,"name":"julian sas band"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"1 DVD-Video and 1 CD-Audio.
