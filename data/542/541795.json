He is bequeathed a huge property which he plans to use for his blind sister (Revathy). Unfortunately, the land happens to be between two proposed sites for a road in which the local MLA (Atul Kulkarni) has an interest, as it leads to his factory. He offers to buy it from Chanti, who refuses, citing it as a memorial of his father. Chanti's sister is married to Raja Ravindra (Raja Ravindra), Chanti's army friend. However, the MLA kills Raja.
