Ten Years ago, there was a \"Ghost-like something\" seen killing people in the dark woods. What really happened? A team of expert hunters go out looking for the \"Silent Killer.\" It was never  found and they dismissed it as an unsolved mystery! When a group of college friends venture off into the deep woods of the Northeastern Valley Mountains to look for this so called legend, their camping and canoeing trip fun turns into FEAR in the FOREST and a dangerous roller coaster adventure ride when they each encounter the unspeakable terror! Now it's a serious struggle against Man Vs Beast in which there can only be one in the end.","popularity":0.2268,"poster_path":"/4I9OAc9cCUHz1oaUsp7UX26B0Y1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107457,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radiant Pictures Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The legend lives...","title":"Fear The Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Elizabeth Kendrick","original_name":"Anna Elizabeth Kendrick","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/plCzCf51np6HQu8YOUAG4Ia3Nec.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Barbara","credit_id":"5b69c71dc3a368188f0f90bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Evans","original_name":"Don Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"5b69c757c3a368188f0f912f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Bora","original_name":"Matthew Bora","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Matt","credit_id":"5b69c77ac3a368188612ae7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin F.
