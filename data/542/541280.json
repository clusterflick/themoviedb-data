The films begin at London Bridge in 1931 with a Schools class 4-4-0 in original condition. Rare colour footage taken in 1938 at London Bridge and Sutton follows. A LBSCR 4-6-4 tank is then shown working a train between London Bridge and Norwood Junction. After sequences showing steam in action in 1931 at East Croydon, the scene shifts to Folkestone with both main line expresses and boat trains on the Harbour branch, in black and white from the 1930s and colour from the 1950s. Coverage of the Golden Arrow and other SR steam hauled Pullmans is followed by extracts from a 1939 cab ride on the electric Brighton Belle.","popularity":0.1725,"poster_path":"/qsn7UHZc7TWBIHS3ibFJqF23VGV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Demand Media Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vol 3 - Vintage Southern","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsn7UHZc7TWBIHS3ibFJqF23VGV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
