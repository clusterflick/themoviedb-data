To his family, friends, and former colleagues, DeAngelo lived the life of the classic “average Joe” - a father, grandfather, veteran, and even former police officer. DeAngelo now stands accused of being the man behind one of the most ruthlessly enduring crime sprees of all time and is believed to have raped more than 45 women and murdered at least 12 people. He is currently charged with 12 counts of first degree murder and has so far not entered a plea. Joining Gosk is Bay Area detective Paul Holes, who helped search for the Golden State Killer for nearly a quarter-century and played a key role in the arrest of Joe DeAngelo.","popularity":0.3674,"poster_path":"/ixS9rT1I3wvWewPnsL2LZToAsk1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5656,"logo_path":"/kUTaaU9zNDeocRqWGVUeJ630yLz.png","name":"Peacock Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden State Killer : Main Suspect","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2104329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Gosk","original_name":"Stephanie Gosk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/isgJkVP3PIH2Ak1cYh2UbTxqMJx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5b6e1176925141405413a579","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2104331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Judy Ho","original_name":"Dr. Judy Ho","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/8VxDbUFXX5NQL0kyckTO4qIS29u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Clinical & Forensic Psychologist","credit_id":"5b6e12230e0a267ef6153118","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1600282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Greenberg","original_name":"Keith Greenberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e12000e0a267ef815b914","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10499,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Elizabeth Waller","original_name":"Elizabeth Waller","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f634e1b156cc70037e0165b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10499,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Elizabeth Waller","original_name":"Elizabeth Waller","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f634e57156cc70038eff7e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8815006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ixS9rT1I3wvWewPnsL2LZToAsk1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5340,"name":"investigation"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"},{"id":161982,"name":"murder investigation"},{"id":246658,"name":"golden state killer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
