This was the guiding idea to which we entrusted, with considerable emotion, our personal memory and the archive footage that we took and collected during those years and which represent the physical body of the battles fought and victories gained everywhere during those ten years. Their value, in a country like Italy which has lost its memory, is a rare witness to the power of human dignity in a constant struggle for its redemption.","popularity":0.2728,"poster_path":"/5vnT8zZoDFwNGQO2A2rSB0ikOFL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now and Forever Time to Reclaim Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernardo Bertolucci","original_name":"Bernardo Bertolucci","popularity":0.7312,"profile_path":"/b0W7CtXxbo24sX8TPnDlLTYfc2E.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b6e1408925141406414b3d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147003,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dario Fo","original_name":"Dario Fo","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/g4sU7AWuVwmnpYPxBWD13G3IoJP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b6e1414925141406414b3e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franca Rame","original_name":"Franca Rame","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/ekiL5DvDFGBYKgoJAlAEdDcpGLR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (archive footage) f","credit_id":"5b6e14250e0a267ee715eb5e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e13ca92514168b60c338f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicola Piovani","original_name":"Nicola Piovani","popularity":0.1775,"profile_path":"/56tRfEIn4RBPhjJ7JOGCOtTZApU.jpg","credit_id":"5b6e13b7c3a368189d1426ba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e13560e0a267ef4154ffd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e13a8c3a3681897147767","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e139e925141404f126f3b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2104334,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giuliana Zamariola","original_name":"Giuliana Zamariola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e13de0e0a267ef4155061","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6e13edc3a368189d1426e2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8886276","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSByYmMojj4NJ1hKRQCzIZ7gx9n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2625,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/5vnT8zZoDFwNGQO2A2rSB0ikOFL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1750},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6HMI1g0oiDCv5hWaTRQssUFI1rV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
