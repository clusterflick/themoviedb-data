After taking over the family business, her sharp shooting act is the only thing keeping the declining Orbeliani Circus afloat. When a stranger and his dog drifts into her home town of Batumi, Georgia from the Black Sea, peddling his own act, Natia wonders if a change of fortune is finally on the horizon. As the circus's prospects begin to rise so do suspicions that the stranger is not who he seems. A fateful interaction forces changes upon Natia and she must leave her family to protect them from what she is becoming. Soon, she is traveling to a different city-by-the-bay, San Francisco, where confrontation and opportunity release a violent darkness rooting within her. Fighting against her loneliness and the rules of this new world, she is befriended by a troubled young artist with an innocent soul. Will this tenuous love lead her out of the darkness? Or, are they merely two halves of broken whole?","popularity":1.0121,"poster_path":"/bz4vbv5i35RT12b4NB31CuFsLXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Blood","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Biani","original_name":"Anna Biani","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Natia Orbeliani","credit_id":"5b6c40239251410341038c57","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bai Ling","original_name":"Bai Ling","popularity":1.5268,"profile_path":"/4NB0MRVFjwutFQCPy8kbq6MEFrb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lilly","credit_id":"5b6c40370e0a267eeb1400eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Madsen","original_name":"Michael Madsen","popularity":1.5049,"profile_path":"/2pKJJKeCggtLOE4hzqgq07KYqFh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Detective Brennan","credit_id":"5b6c404e9251414056109e9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Kryukov","original_name":"Константин Крюков","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/7p5pwqDMbSOJYu8Su1cJnGPv4vg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sasha Voloshin","credit_id":"5b6c406fc3a368188616b73a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Nilsson","original_name":"Rob Nilsson","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/kqMgOljEdjiXSo8iWuOZ75ccPTr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ruthven","credit_id":"5b6c408b925141406812acf2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kato Kaelin","original_name":"Kato Kaelin","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/deYSq10fLY9M2wN8ULcUt1XbcdF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Thaddeush Wilson","credit_id":"5b6c40a1c3a36818991194d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1392056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bailey Coppola","original_name":"Bailey Coppola","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/yY484RNFjlzexxuC196DuAfoUYx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"5b6c40b7c3a368537509e4dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2103385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayra Bela","original_name":"Bayra Bela","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":"/1R2mpc83olTLyZeyQv2rfTzyQoq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Aria","credit_id":"5b6c40cec3a368188f13158b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Silver","original_name":"Alain Silver","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66040a9a81da39017dc2bba7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599685,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew Giannetta","original_name":"Andrew Giannetta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66040a85d38b58017d1c2b4d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Coppola","original_name":"Christopher Coppola","popularity":0.1733,"profile_path":"/vaquMdfKEBOz3ouoDtdI6oFAZSp.jpg","credit_id":"5b6c3ff29251410341038c16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1299581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgi Maskharashvili","original_name":"გიორგი მასხარაშვილი","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":"/7R4xUHIzzO0INPGzwEd8gltzV8a.jpg","credit_id":"6750537efb7298c11a216bbe","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5081618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d8pbll2WhA0YbEpVHWkYW2yVmSy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bz4vbv5i35RT12b4NB31CuFsLXa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
