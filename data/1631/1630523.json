At 19, I was in a diving club and I loved Jacques Martin's show, 'Incroyable mais vrai' (Incredible but True). I dreamed of participating in this hit program.\" After careful consideration, André Payraud had the idea of ​​the century, an idea that would attract media attention: to descend the Grands-Montets glacier on his stomach, wearing a full wetsuit (mask, snorkel, fins, and neoprene suit). A crazy idea that drew a flood of press coverage. The film, \"Swimming Down the Mont Blanc Torrent,\" directed by Didier Lafond, was broadcast twice on France 2 and even won an award.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/ondvPCYCzviV83wZTSkntKioM2O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1117,"logo_path":"/2X2uFeObxawiAajNDOf3Mhri5Wg.png","name":"Antenne 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torrent du Mont Blanc à la nage","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5991260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Payraud","original_name":"André Payraud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qPy3LwEDAswHiGDnTlhswnw45ME.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69863a96f519e788af289f16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3369154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Lafond","original_name":"Didier Lafond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bMRaZQxeXcP7PxYVVVEFXegAML9.jpg","credit_id":"69863a8103baacfed02193d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5991788,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herbert Blanchard","original_name":"Herbert Blanchard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69867e2c368cc9102b61aadb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32251238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTV5nnrN2LgrMFPiQFKolvsQxnX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ondvPCYCzviV83wZTSkntKioM2O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2006,"name":"extreme sports"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":367177,"name":"hydrospeed"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
