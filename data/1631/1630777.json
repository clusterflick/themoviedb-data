This film tells the story of three boys - Luke, Louis and Dominic - during their first term at Sunningdale, a small family-run prep school in Berkshire that educates 100 boys, the vast majority of whom go on to top public schools like Eton or Harrow.  From the daily chapel services, to the headmaster's weekly dormitory check, and the boys' very first night in dormitories, we get to understand the magical world of boarding school life from the boy's point of view.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain's Youngest Boarders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5992193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Clegg","original_name":"Luke Clegg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"As himself","credit_id":"6986c24d6acd1778d58c87c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5992194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Clegg","original_name":"James Clegg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"As Himself","credit_id":"6986c2624188a3a24d8c87cd","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1762239","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
