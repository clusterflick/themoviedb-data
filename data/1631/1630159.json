The school was held in two shifts from 8 am to 8 pm in the child-filled Kallio area, with 2,300 students and 75 teachers. The most fun hour here is recess, and many children certainly ate their best meal at school. But they only got a refreshing shower when the teacher dispensed it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21046,"logo_path":"/ghVwr2Y0DgRbg3b4Mm3FVdhJ6Fo.png","name":"Suomi-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1937-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suomen uudenaikaisin kansakoulu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9161766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"1937-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
