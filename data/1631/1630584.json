Work is focusing on cultural transformations and communication. If gesture of deaf--mute has an informational capacity, the absurdity of collective gesture is transformed into existential metaphor. The video researches personal physical and political boundaries marked by rituals such as the parades, gymnastic pyramids and traditions.
