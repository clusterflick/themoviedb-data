The images are taken from stock photos - photos taken by professional photographers and distributed digitally. The images emerge in tempo to the utterance of various words by a female voice. The result is a compact sequence of images that draws the viewer in through the rythm of the words. The absurd alphabetical listings of terms describing landscapes provides a new entrance to the familiar image of nature, drawing it towards the unknown. Images and words are juxtaposed without hierarchy and lose their original meaning.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yYtRA2at2Onp9qAUq2fTuc0SZyD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atoll, Bay, Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4010821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayatgali Tuleubek","original_name":"Ayatgali Tuleubek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69866933c32fd5c1746b5a94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYtRA2at2Onp9qAUq2fTuc0SZyD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
