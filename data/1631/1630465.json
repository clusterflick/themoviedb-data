Through intimate, character-led storytelling, the film follows a teacher struggling to stay sharp in front of a class while her doctor dismisses her symptoms; a firefighter who manages heavy bleeding and hot flashes on shift without basic accommodations; and clinicians who candidly acknowledge they were never trained to recognize, let alone treat, this stage of life. Partners and spouses are drawn in, too—navigating mood swings, reduced intimacy, and their own helplessness under the weight of the unknown.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The (M) Factor 2: Before the Pause (Perimenopause)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacoba Atlas","original_name":"Jacoba Atlas","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698625bf25a9fb833e6917c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacoba Atlas","original_name":"Jacoba Atlas","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698625d1a10ef060146917aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5990985,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tamsen Fadal","original_name":"Tamsen Fadal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69862612eb7c2beb8b219369","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5046165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanne LaMarca Mathisen","original_name":"Joanne LaMarca Mathisen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6986264cf281a1ce05219452","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5990988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denise Pines","original_name":"Denise Pines","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6986266f368cc9102b61a811","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5990989,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Codi Barbini","original_name":"Codi Barbini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6986268d720648258c289ec3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
