The film moves between moments of motivation and closeness to happiness, and moments of emptiness and uncertainty, creating an emotional fog where nothing is fully defined. Through a metaphorical approach, the project invites the audience to find personal resonance in feelings, not in concrete explanations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FEELINGS FROM YOUR PAST","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5888643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arta Zeka","original_name":"Arta Zeka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698602de6e8e506c6e6916c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
