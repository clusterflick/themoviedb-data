Bowery appears on one side under a spotlight, only able to see his reflection. On the other side, the audience watches. Sounds of insects and the street outside can be heard. Different scents, like banana and marshmallow, fill the room.  This was the set up of Bowery’s first performance in a gallery. In October 1988, he posed at the Anthony d’Offay Gallery, London, for two hours each day, across five days. He wore a new look every day, selected from those he had worn over the last four years. The spots suit, checkerboard dress, and green feathery jacket were remade by designer and corsetier Mr Pearl (some of which are displayed in Room 2) due to the originals being covered in ‘disco dirt’. Bowery worked closely with the gallerist Lorcan O’Neill, who had invited him to perform, the artist Cerith Wyn Evans, who also filmed and edited the video documentation, and DJ Malcolm Duffy who worked on the sound.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"You watching me, me watching me","title":"Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Bowery","original_name":"Leigh Bowery","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":"/emVFAcDMiSQJ29SloiE4LljFZkT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69869496fa7196c7aa230153","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","original_name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698694ecc552cb626291f603","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","original_name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6986950565b626c98093b4b4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","original_name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69869512a36f208c8991f646","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5991957,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mr. Pearl","original_name":"Mr. Pearl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69869584e39e7acc5a6df16f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5991960,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malcolm Duffy","original_name":"Malcolm Duffy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698695d567cfc1839eb92077","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
