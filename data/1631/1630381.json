Upon arrival, he finds himself among a group of boys who've been bruised by life and forgotten by society. At first, the center seems safe - a second chance. But beneath its welcoming facade lies a brutal regime, where extreme treatments and violent methods are the norm. As the boys begin to understand the true nature of the institution, Parker must rally them to plan an escape - not just to get out, but to survive.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Disorder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Sprayberry","original_name":"Dylan Sprayberry","popularity":1.7144,"profile_path":"/buzNvV8K6PpCsGg0bVfbW82wHmq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Parker Decker","credit_id":"6985facdcf9cd870413452e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Fleshler","original_name":"Glenn Fleshler","popularity":1.4846,"profile_path":"/x1Cef2yPZS7bJTwxI7DX3q0HNcv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roger","credit_id":"6985fad87ff989bd3d29a67b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3483785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thalia Besson","original_name":"Thalia Besson","popularity":0.4842,"profile_path":"/krV0T5FCYM1o5YxPiQASawuxPYN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nurse Lilly","credit_id":"6985fae7a72fb7a79199d781","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barthélémy Grossmann","original_name":"Barthélémy Grossmann","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/mfGxixH9QxpCSystzLNbMjenLO5.jpg","credit_id":"6985fafc368cc9102b61a728","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Sprayberry","original_name":"Dylan Sprayberry","popularity":1.7144,"profile_path":"/buzNvV8K6PpCsGg0bVfbW82wHmq.jpg","credit_id":"6985fb0a2ed71375b621914f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Besson","original_name":"Luc Besson","popularity":3.2984,"profile_path":"/dXJdczT1NcvcZtnoWVGT0NmG11v.jpg","credit_id":"6985fb12c9cd19b4bf99d6db","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Besson","original_name":"Luc Besson","popularity":3.2984,"profile_path":"/dXJdczT1NcvcZtnoWVGT0NmG11v.jpg","credit_id":"6985fb1dca9992afb748dbf3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450076,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Colin Wandersman","original_name":"Colin Wandersman","popularity":0.228,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6985fb28eb6020f684219211","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35455,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Hugues Tissandier","original_name":"Hugues Tissandier","popularity":0.326,"profile_path":"/azWzT3YZ3HvnoUFyVgYS9CFPWLQ.jpg","credit_id":"6985fb3e9b6ea0673761a69f","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39602391","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
