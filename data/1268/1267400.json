With the idea of reaching the most extreme parts of the globe, they experimented with the aridity of the Atacama and Australian deserts, sailed through the howling 50th to Antarctica, experienced the heat of the Amazon rainforest, built a raft to descend the Yukon, and experienced the harshness of the Bolivian high plateaus and the Celestial Mountains of Kyrgyzstan. In three years of adventure, the succession of trials and encounters reveals the unlikely past of some of them. All these experiences teach them, in the course of the journey, the greatness of man.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4FMkIJCRdAyfXobDoE23P6oQv3o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solidream, trois ans de défis et d'amitié autour du monde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":2246,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4FMkIJCRdAyfXobDoE23P6oQv3o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
