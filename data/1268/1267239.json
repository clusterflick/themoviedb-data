Batto’s wife died a decade ago in an accident, leaving him with an adopted son, Bittu, who desires to inherit the last piece of land for himself. Bittu deceives Batto over the death of his wife, prompting Batto to question his relationships, his choices, and the life he has led with the Sultan and alcohol. Sultan, who harbours doubts, confronts Batto for the truth. Through trials of deception and betrayal, Batto learns the importance of scepticism, resilience, and the enduring strength of genuine friendship.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xbk5kXnLLWsdijhNaJ6yRoHkuOP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dada Lakhmi Chand State University of Performing and Visual Arts, Rothak","origin_country":""},{"id":180918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pandit Lakhmi Chand State University of Performing and Visual Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Batto's Bubble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akshay Bhardwaj","original_name":"Akshay Bhardwaj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660a6a9fa885870149e4dc73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627230,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aryan Singh","original_name":"Aryan Singh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660a6add35818f017c394321","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akshay Bhardwaj","original_name":"Akshay Bhardwaj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660a6aaca88587017ce589e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627195,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rupalika Paul","original_name":"Rupalika Paul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660c30ef33a376014a80bd7a","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xbk5kXnLLWsdijhNaJ6yRoHkuOP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
