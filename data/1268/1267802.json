This project took me around half a year to complete and takes inspiration from books like ‘Hellstar Remina’ and ‘Vermis’ as well as films like ‘The Thing’, ‘Nope’, ‘Lake Mungo’ and ‘Mad God’. This project is not as focussed or linear as my previous projects and I mainly tried to focus on creating smoother animation and more atmospheric scenes.","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":"/nNmGZyeTzsjJmkHDC4IQbQ9DUCU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225063,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Sixth Door","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something Found Us","title":"THE STAR SPORE","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3795022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ripley Howarth","original_name":"Ripley Howarth","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/6PeoLqHSNGCUbyIX6cxR4kj9OiS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Farmer","credit_id":"660accb6cabfe401652f0585","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Maiden","original_name":"Tyler Maiden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"660acccf35818f0162390d49","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3795022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ripley Howarth","original_name":"Ripley Howarth","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/6PeoLqHSNGCUbyIX6cxR4kj9OiS.jpg","credit_id":"660acca3e039f1017ce51b9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3795022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ripley Howarth","original_name":"Ripley Howarth","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/6PeoLqHSNGCUbyIX6cxR4kj9OiS.jpg","credit_id":"660acc94d6dbba017d6fc8ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":1154,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mDpijbMWfO8h4Yg7xhl9CIr3fuv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2056},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nyMYbu5H55UsjlvYbmxR3P9JTAR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/auEzNRmWdGCnZg2U92amBJf8gbt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nNmGZyeTzsjJmkHDC4IQbQ9DUCU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9882,"name":"space"},{"id":197582,"name":"mysterious"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"},{"id":315058,"name":"horror"},{"id":325825,"name":"horrified"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
