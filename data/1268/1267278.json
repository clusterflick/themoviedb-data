Увидеть чтобы поверить","overview":"For eight years, a team of specialists created a whole world about which almost nothing was known. The world of Kievan Rus of the tenth century. They managed to make historical films with documentary accuracy. Icelandic sagas and the works of Oriental travelers, Byzantine books and, of course, ancient Russian chronicles were studied and researched. The oldest dated chronicle is kept in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. It was these texts that formed the basis of the script. Five built cities, hand—sewn costumes, forged weapons, a Viking ship — a drakkar — built according to the drawings of that time, complex computer graphics - all in order for the viewer to fully immerse himself in the atmosphere of the early Middle Ages of the Viking film.","popularity":0.2669,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viking.
