Through interviews and photographic records of the Plataforma neighborhood, the short film proposes a reflection on the right to the city, especially the right to art in Salvador's favelas. As well as problematizing the lack of incentives for peripheral culture, it also explores the relationship between care and learning. With moving stories, Zé Eduardo and Vilma Santos will tell us a little about the construction of the collection they designed together. Acervo da Laje goes beyond being just a physical space; it is a daily practice that encourages art and knowledge for people with a voice who have never had the opportunity to be heard.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/v7anK4zkXoVHKd5WVc7Q2eZJHVA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224311,"logo_path":null,"name":"RECAN
