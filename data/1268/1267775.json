Despite a filming ban, young Burmese filmmakers clandestinely visited devastated villages after the storm, capturing surreal scenes of loss and resilience. Their emotional footage reveals the profound impact of Nargis, depicting a world where life and death intertwine, altering countless lives forever. For security reasons, the filmmakers couldn't reveal their names and they used pseudonyms. But for the first time, they screened the film with their real names at the 2nd Wathann Film Festival in 2012.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/nSoRCTjJ2bgQdMFYPGTKkLYZzdG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2010-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nargis: When Time Stopped Breathing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"The Maw Naing","original_name":"သည်မော်နိုင်","popularity":0.0515,"profile_path":"/A5AtN9r8Pvpt6uTuFnbdFyzDnhF.jpg","credit_id":"660ab4935aadc4016362cde6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pe Maung Same","original_name":"Pe Maung Same","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ab49b9c97bd017ca3b110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsey Merrison","original_name":"Lindsey Merrison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6679a607c71083ead7d3b0b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1740522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":817,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nSoRCTjJ2bgQdMFYPGTKkLYZzdG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":577},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cgRyVueOi64bJm4CtszggiLfwJc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel Film Festival","release_date":"2010-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nargis - When Time Stopped Breathing; Trailer","key":"BbXICCoSTWY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-07-29T07:33:49.000Z","id":"6679a56e85ef0c58f6a09107"}]}}}
