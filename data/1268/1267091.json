In and in-between 70.000 drawings made over the past 20 years, Alexander Schellow reconstructs 105 minutes of the face of his grandmother. Born in 1913 in Königsberg, she died in a home for people with dementia in Berlin at the age of 102. The intertwined streams of remembering and forgetting form a space of immersive sound and image. They unfold an impossible cinematic archive — a place inhabited by disparate temporalities. Yet, together with the perpetually transforming cartography of black spots and acoustic traces questions of response-ability, care, representation and embodied history are set into movement across the projection screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ltsATi1ET1IouQfXAMFcwOX7LM3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SIE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Schellow","original_name":"Alexander Schellow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66089baa2faf4d017dca3c7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltsATi1ET1IouQfXAMFcwOX7LM3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Courtisane Festival 23rd edition","release_date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pavilion of Albania, Venice, (IT) ","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
