Thanks to the strength of their group, they have developed a solid project based on an ecological manufacturing process to produce durable, high-tech products. We'd like to encourage their initiative and democratize the use of wooden sports equipment. With our experience of roaming in extreme environments, we'll be testing IN'BÔ's specially-built bikes in the Pamir mountains of Tajikistan to meet isolated communities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4OYP8CklkQiQbC1FAH1tdDgnxxc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les œuvres du Pamir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4OYP8CklkQiQbC1FAH1tdDgnxxc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1081}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
