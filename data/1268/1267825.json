Images with the urgency of an Instagram story create a dialogue within the family across the sea: Mourad and Fairuz, Tunisia and abroad. You have to go to the roof to see something of the surroundings: the railway behind the house. Away from the house, away from home. Street dogs and cats in front of the house. Without a house, without a home. The sound of the train carries a disturbing longing. The image of the sea opens up a dangerous desire. To stay. To dream. Time passes both slowly and quickly when the possibility of new life disrupts the routine.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53178,"logo_path":"/dh9hl8PXWcmpToXP9HsTLqHswlT.png","name":"Auguste Orts","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2024-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bamssi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mourad Ben Amor","original_name":"Mourad Ben Amor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ad9a835818f01623911c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Courtisane Festival","release_date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
