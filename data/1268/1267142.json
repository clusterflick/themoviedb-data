It takes place in a diner where people eat food – that, unbeknownst to them, is made of human flesh! It’s just another regular, working day until a drifter enters through the front door to stir things up for Pops and the other staff members. We follow Maggy as she’s hired to work as a waitress, and when the diner closes and the doors lock, she must fight her way through and trust her gut before the cannibals eat her heart out!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We Want You!","title":"*SHUNK*","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
