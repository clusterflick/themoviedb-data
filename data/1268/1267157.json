What is her show about, you ask? I think you should ask yourself why you insist on knowing everything? Please, just show up for the thing, be surprised and go with the flow?  Okay, I’ll tell you: the show is about Urooj, her family, things that annoy her and things she loves. She will obviously talk about herself since she’s already speaking in the third person. \"Please come to my show. I love you.\" - Urooj Ashfaq.  Urooj has appeared on India’s Queens of Comedy and just finished her first stand-up tour of the UK. Super skilled at crowd work, Urooj’s audiences are guaranteed a fun time as she charmingly entertains with tales of her parents' divorce, cultural differences and the humour she easily finds in the daily intricacies of life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urooj Ashfaq - Oh No!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
