Perlov’s film highlights all the key milestones in the leader’s life which it goes about doing in the tradition of the reflexive documentary, through the creator’s subjective and artistic pov. The film goes back and forth between documentary and scripted scenes, black and white and technicolour, and even archival footage colourised in bold, artificial colours.","popularity":0.2189,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Covenant Communications","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"42:6 - Ben Gurion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Ansky","original_name":"Alex Ansky","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6788e9299de8a2d834977e82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmuel Atzmon","original_name":"Shmuel Atzmon","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6788e95d55e49bed5e977f63","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1443218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avraham Ben-Yosef","original_name":"Avraham Ben-Yosef","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6788e9a0b9d1d10ef197828f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Brin","original_name":"Rolf Brin","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6788e9ea94d95839f3ad288f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Israel Gurion","original_name":"Israel Gurion","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6788ea2b88c55856d51d485b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Hizkiyahu","original_name":"Albert Hizkiyahu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6788ea4279cf13ee41ad2243","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abraham Ronai","original_name":"Abraham Ronai","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6788ea9d3a43075f431d381d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pnina Shai","original_name":"Pnina Shai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6788eac579cf13ee41ad228c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Perlov","original_name":"David Perlov","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/oXFHsE3rCXg7rNIobA9aSLwHthQ.jpg","credit_id":"660c7bfe35818f017c3b23be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914569,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Danny ben Menahem","original_name":"Danny ben Menahem","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b781edf78f9b02ea4c12ca","department":"Lighting","job":"Electrician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Greenberg","original_name":"Adam Greenberg","popularity":0.2794,"profile_path":"/xBoRwMbE6KRlxs6PZXYQqGuU71x.jpg","credit_id":"675d9308018dc8e7bbd1863e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31050,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erwin Hillier","original_name":"Erwin Hillier","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/u64CuKquMk7PhpqIXYizaBXHRIk.jpg","credit_id":"675d931441f353ce086d0111","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Pace","original_name":"Eric Pace","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788e86ca64feb16c91d4421","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15061,"name":"docudrama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"Year certain, month and date uncertain.
