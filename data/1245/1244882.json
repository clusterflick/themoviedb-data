'Cindy' and her prince are now at the point in the narrative where things get serious: Life decisions are coming up, buying a house is within reach, and even if everything seems to be going perfectly at first glance, something seems to be missing. By chance, Cindy meets three non-binary fairies who help her discover a space for queer utopias, polyamorous desire, and alternative ways of living.","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":"/1gSXuv3EucovOwjEjeoN0suc3nv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Ever After","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saba Hosseini","original_name":"Saba Hosseini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65cce3caed2ac20163ae92f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Smith","original_name":"David Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65cce3d2e210230147c2d00d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2793786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabea Lüthi","original_name":"Rabea Lüthi","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/kuJ4ghztaWFWJ7CDJeNWKoIlql.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65cce3de15c6360187e60faa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Stehlin","original_name":"Nina Stehlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65cce3e4e263bb014a681cdb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliv Heuss","original_name":"Oliv Heuss","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65cce3ed6636270186088170","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merle Zurawski","original_name":"Merle Zurawski","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cce373ed2ac20186af6b75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juli Paul Bökamp","original_name":"Juli Paul Bökamp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cce3fa15c6360187e60fd5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1gSXuv3EucovOwjEjeoN0suc3nv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
