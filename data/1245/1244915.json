For larger-than-life climbing legends Warren ‘Batso’ Harding and Dean Caldwell, it represented a near impossible physical and mental challenge. For iconoclast Batso, it also offered one last chance to stick it to the naysayers who thought him too old, too out of touch, and too crazy. For novice Dean, it was a way to see beyond his 9-5 existence and unlock the awesome potential of the human spirit. What began as an almost farcical exercise became one of the great underdog stories in the history of the sport. The estimated 10-day climb stretched into a 28-day marathon of grit and determination which sparked a media sensation.","popularity":2.3193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":220749,"logo_path":null,"name":"north.five.six","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Batso and the Wall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Batso and the Wall","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Hawke","original_name":"Ethan Hawke","popularity":2.2467,"profile_path":"/slO6aoxA5Pwiy42yt8Fxz5bm1kH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Warren 'Batso' Harding","credit_id":"65ccf78515c6360164e554fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","original_name":"Daniel Radcliffe","popularity":9.1638,"profile_path":"/iPg0J9UzAlPj1fLEJNllpW9IhGe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dean Caldwell","credit_id":"65ccf875fba625017d021e99","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Biel","original_name":"Jessica Biel","popularity":3.0623,"profile_path":"/3txkpzteYNW12vpREFpagSrWe6d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Beryl Knauth","credit_id":"65ccf88ce263bb0163689dc0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1983503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Marvin","original_name":"Kyle Marvin","popularity":0.1802,"profile_path":"/gwN9M56cbYpIPhj7sjMs8xJ6z84.jpg","credit_id":"65ccf899258823017da75795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536306,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eamon O’Sullivan","original_name":"Eamon O’Sullivan","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccf8ac1365450186a259d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287627,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ross Jacobson","original_name":"Ross Jacobson","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccf8dc258823017da7584b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":991827,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben LeClair","original_name":"Ben LeClair","popularity":0.2698,"profile_path":"/6uOBMF8Ob8JRajGhfUJ0fAnntNl.jpg","credit_id":"65ccf8e9894ed6017c28462e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734485,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Roberts","original_name":"Mark Roberts","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/6V92sjhYS8hcCaLJxAVwUsaLwp8.jpg","credit_id":"65ccf901e263bb0163689ea7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2226017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael J.
