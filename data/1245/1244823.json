I erase myself from every frame and meet all versions of myself. Evanescence is a reflection on death and transience from the point of view of a person remaining behind. It is a film about the search for identity in an ever-changing world, whose future itself is increasingly uncertain. The death enforces the awareness of the inexorable nature of transience. Enfolded by space that is in a state of constant flux, endlessly emerging and disappearing, the author too fluctuates with it.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/oYU7WxVzDupt9lKgDhw0sDsQx0N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinoklub Zagreb","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2024-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evanescence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4535874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeronim Jandrić","original_name":"Jeronim Jandrić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccbeda1365450186a22e25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mare Šuljak","original_name":"Mare Šuljak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccbecdefd3c2017c37bcbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mare Šuljak","original_name":"Mare Šuljak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6660b088c4f89e08c0a22998","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oYU7WxVzDupt9lKgDhw0sDsQx0N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
