Her life seemed like a fairy tale come true, until a harrowing public breakdown, fueled by drugs, shattered her career and compelled her to return to her quaint hometown, Willow Falls. Back in her roots, Ness rekindled her connection with her past, reuniting with old friends, and rediscovering her faith, thanks to her supportive father. Little did she anticipate that the townspeople would be so moved by her journey that they decided to create their own film, with Ness as their leading lady. In the midst of this heartfelt tale, comedy, tragedy, and the power of forgiveness enveloped the small-town girl who had been concealed beneath the glamorous facade of a Hollywood starlet.","popularity":0.1194,"poster_path":"/pvZyhGANv9LwBHqIam9xsWjxQKL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Abiding Nail","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4533686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Rozzi","original_name":"Ashley Rozzi","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ness","credit_id":"65caebcb12970c017bc5ea41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4533688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Valantine","original_name":"Walter Valantine","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John Showstrum","credit_id":"65caebdf336e01017cbe271c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4533690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Carlo","original_name":"Ross Carlo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Derrick Dewey","credit_id":"65caebf58c0a48017cb7905f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2573192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Fogarty","original_name":"Jim Fogarty","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Stew","credit_id":"65caec211c09fb01823814fe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Milligan","original_name":"Jennifer Milligan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dawn Larson","credit_id":"65caec5e00508a017b41fbc8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4533697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Kuhn","original_name":"Jim Kuhn","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sheriff Ted Evans","credit_id":"65caecbe8c0a480163b739c9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Victor Schotten","original_name":"William Victor Schotten","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65caecd5336e01017cbe27f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Victor Schotten","original_name":"William Victor Schotten","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65caece7761421017cbee837","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21219724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvZyhGANv9LwBHqIam9xsWjxQKL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Abiding Nail Trailer","key":"Jd7t_tMrhWI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-18T10:15:03.000Z","id":"65caed36a06efe0184766741"}]}}}
