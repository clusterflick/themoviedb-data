In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kirtland AFB was home to a wide range of highly classified technology experiments involving lasers, stealth aircraft, and nuclear weapons. Strange phenomena in the skies above the base piqued the interest of amateur and professional UFO investigators. Doty’s job was to recruit UFO researchers to be informants to the Air Force about goings-on in the UFO community and to spread military disinformation about UFOs among their peers. To accomplish this, Doty supplied fake documents to UFO investigators purporting to tell the “truth” about government involvement with extraterrestrials.","popularity":0.2919,"poster_path":"/sl6uvG4NZcSd3hpC6KylYRbheIM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Doty","original_name":"Richard Doty","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vFrBve6Ky5SRSxmDXiUs8dD4XrP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65ccbafded2ac20163ae8056","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425076,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Trevor Paglen","original_name":"Trevor Paglen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccb9eb4a0b190163ce5ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Doty","original_name":"Richard Doty","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vFrBve6Ky5SRSxmDXiUs8dD4XrP.jpg","credit_id":"65ccc12ae210230185c3ec16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425076,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Trevor Paglen","original_name":"Trevor Paglen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc7c415c6360164e5426b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425076,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Trevor Paglen","original_name":"Trevor Paglen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc7d7e210230185c3f1d5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1196,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5e2IdQDovwXdPagv6NxfGwcTELz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2127}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sl6uvG4NZcSd3hpC6KylYRbheIM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9951,"name":"alien"},{"id":9738,"name":"ufo"},{"id":10410,"name":"conspiracy"},{"id":18420,"name":"surveillance"},{"id":162300,"name":"government cover-up"},{"id":200883,"name":"classified"},{"id":326902,"name":"psyops"},{"id":328727,"name":"air force office of special investigations"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Featured in the e-Flux Film programme, Uncomputables.","release_date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trevor Paglen’s Known Unknowns","key":"womN391yqDY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-10T16:54:29.000Z","id":"65ccbffb4a0b190147cdea9f"}]}}}
