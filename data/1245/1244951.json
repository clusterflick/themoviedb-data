There were times when he was unable to make as many films as he wanted due to wartime film regulations and post-war Toho disputes, but in 1951 he revived his career with Meshi. Since then, he has released masterpieces one after another, including \"Okaasan,\" \"Lightning,\" \"The Couple,\" \"Wife,\" \"Anii Mouto,\" \"Sounds of the Mountain,\" and \"Bangiku.\" The pinnacle of his work, \"Floating Clouds,\" is Kenji Mizoguchi's \"Wife.\" Even director Ozu was impressed, calling it a masterpiece of Japanese cinema, on par with \"The Sisters of Gion.\" He depicted ordinary people in everyday life with an everyday realism that was not influenced by lyricism, and he consistently sought out women as his subjects.","popularity":0.1835,"poster_path":"/8EmIignsk1kh5aCz66A9KU94vhe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mikio Naruse 100th Birth Anniversary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"生诞100年 映画监督成濑巳喜男展","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikio Naruse","original_name":"成瀬巳喜男","popularity":0.485,"profile_path":"/a2OGYZQ8UGFCQKl5TpVQd893j1D.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65cd08dfe210230162c371c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akira Takarada","original_name":"宝田明","popularity":0.5469,"profile_path":"/bnL8ZbICuHSXrTJlLYf3EDa3zfW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"65cd08fde210230162c371ed","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1444,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8EmIignsk1kh5aCz66A9KU94vhe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1096}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":331079,"name":"japanese cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
