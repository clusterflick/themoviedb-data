It represents nothing, it signifies nothing. There’s no hidden meaning, no defined subject, no predetermined objective.  Inside and outside. Just angles, textures and flashes of color. A whole different empire of vision, impossible to be put into words.  “Nothing” as anything outside common visual knowledge, anything that defies the logic of naming the world; a possibility for a new way of thinking; of dealing with our visual world.","popularity":0.1921,"poster_path":"/fciW5k7fsbJhIth1LzLvmD6ZuXk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2024-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sense of Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Rojas","original_name":"Francisco Rojas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/alM7di30Uv29FgE7SE7Y0GfJL9.jpg","credit_id":"65cb8a9e5be00e0163ac9ff3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Rojas","original_name":"Francisco Rojas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/alM7di30Uv29FgE7SE7Y0GfJL9.jpg","credit_id":"65cb8aaa8c0a480163b7815e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Rojas","original_name":"Francisco Rojas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/alM7di30Uv29FgE7SE7Y0GfJL9.jpg","credit_id":"65cb8ab88c3159017c3946e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fciW5k7fsbJhIth1LzLvmD6ZuXk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":282732,"name":"abstract cinema"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Millenium Film Workshop/Open Screening","release_date":"2024-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
