The measures were implemented mainly for moral reasons and affected socially marginalized families in particular. The parents had hardly any success in legal proceedings against these decisions. Instead of fighting poverty, the state fought the poor. In the participatory ethnographic documentary \"And then we were taken away\", two men in their sixties talk about the administrative foster care they experienced as a child. They lead the audience to the homes, locations of their tumultuous youth and to their favourite places. Through their biographies, the men document how out-of-home placements shaped their childhood, youth and present.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nJtycDR4MHpWPjR7RiwPl0D4UcD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Then We Were Taken Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Bollag","original_name":"Jessica Bollag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbe9a48c0a48017cb8869e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Bollag","original_name":"Jessica Bollag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbe98d11386c016351360e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Bollag","original_name":"Jessica Bollag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbe9af8c0a48017cb886a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Bollag","original_name":"Jessica Bollag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbe9996dc5070163b20950","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Bollag","original_name":"Jessica Bollag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cbe983a06efe0184774c1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31277916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nJtycDR4MHpWPjR7RiwPl0D4UcD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2023-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival of Engaged Ethnographic Film Vizantrop","release_date":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
