A Canadian border town offering 'quickie baptisms' and 'hatless dancing.' The documentary THIN ICE captures the zany and fertile imagination of acclaimed humourist Bruce McCall, and reveals his personal and creative journey from a 1940s boyhood in small-town Canada to present-day success as a New York writer and artist. McCall has been called variously a \"god\" and a \"genius\" by admirers like Steve Martin and David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker.","popularity":0.3212,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The documentary THIN ICE captures the zany and fertile imagination of acclaimed humourist Bruce McCall, and reveals his personal and creative journey from a 1940s boyhood in small-town Canada to present-day success as a New York writer and artist.","title":"Thin Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4535463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce McCall","original_name":"Bruce McCall","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65cc643c894ed6017c27979a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Martin","original_name":"Steve Martin","popularity":1.437,"profile_path":"/d0KthX8hVWU9BxTCG1QUO8FURRm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65cc644aefd3c201303696b7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Green","original_name":"Laurence Green","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cc641013af5f01639f85b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268689","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
