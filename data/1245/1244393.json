The monologues throughout the film emphasize the character's feeling of being stuck and her confrontation with the unconscious. As a result of the confrontation, the audience is left with a mind ready to be completely liberated. Experimental narrative, creative montage and sound design come to the forefront in “Why Am I Still Here Then?”, and it narrates us understanding and accepting our unconscious.","popularity":0.0517,"poster_path":"/r3ydlnqyhsrADbYcE70Qn2cImAG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161863,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMOM
