Upon discoveries of dinosaurs, marine fossils and significant Indigenous sites and petroglyphs on nearby farmland, an aging population of community volunteers come together to preserve the land and its stories including the Indigenous history, paleontology, and local ecology. “We have found a living library” says Métis Artist Jo Cooper who has spent the past 20 years in Herschel working alongside locals. The stories of the land and the echoes of the past form new friendships, unravel mysteries and model a potential for deep justice, reconciliation and healing between people and the land.","popularity":0.4047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Custodians: A Story of Ancient Echoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Lafond","original_name":"Harry Lafond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65ccd6536636270186087905","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Neufeld","original_name":"David Neufeld","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65ccd680ed2ac20186af6066","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Leitch","original_name":"Andy Leitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccd6ade210230185c3ff7b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Langendoen","original_name":"Brad Langendoen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccd69aefd3c2017c37cf79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163976,"name":"reconciliation"},{"id":207960,"name":"saskatchewan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
