To people who don't take music seriously, I'm a comedian. To people who don't take anything seriously, I'm a clown.\" - Victor Borge Danish composer, songwriter, entertainer and \"comedian of the keyboard\", Victor Borge made his American radio debut on the \"Bing Crosby Show\". He then created a one-man show \"Comedy in Music\" and made concert appearances throughout the USA and Europe, delighting audiences with his unique hybrid between stand-up and high art. Victor Borge takes the musical mickey out of the great composers in laugh-out-loud spoofs filled with his trademark double-takes and double-entendres. Invited time and again to Australian television, his Channel 9 appearances in the '80s and early '90s are legendary as he steals the show from Don Lane, Derryn Hinch and Ray Martin on both \"The Midday Show\" and \"A Current Affair\". Interviews with Liz Hayes and footage from \"Sunday\" provide fascinating background to this showbiz legend.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victor Borge Around Australia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2497592","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
