After a few hair-raising stunts that will give nervous ones in your audience a jolt. Bert demands money that Charles owes him. They end a fast chase on the roof of a building overlooking a lion's den. Here Bert slips down the roof in among the beasts and Bert lowers a flag to half mast, supposing of course this is the end of his pal. But to his astonishment Charles not only comes out alive but is seen reclining comfortably on one of the biggest lions.","popularity":0.1916,"poster_path":"/j3shKANmhfcMEh2JgbXhPp2blrd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Century Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hold Your Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Dorety","original_name":"Charles Dorety","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/nAp7j4pXQjdXII7TxRq8SQwNjcv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65cc5a94efd3c2014936afaa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Roach","original_name":"Bert Roach","popularity":0.188,"profile_path":"/q9EUBkdaWo5cBceHN3L97nINtWh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65cc5aa815c6360187e58117","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Watson","original_name":"William Watson","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cc5a3415c6360187e58037","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Watson","original_name":"William Watson","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc1474a0b190186cf1d72","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abe Stern","original_name":"Abe Stern","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc15aefd3c2017c37bedb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julius Stern","original_name":"Julius Stern","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc185258823017da71fd9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0327877","wikidata_id":"Q17627486","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j3shKANmhfcMEh2JgbXhPp2blrd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1921-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
