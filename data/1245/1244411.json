The groups recognisable three-part tight harmonies are now iconic as well as their top hits featured in Saturday Night Fever. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists. Occasionally referred to as 'The Disco Kings', brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb transformed themselves into musical legends, and despite Barry being the only remaining member, their legacy has never died. The Bee Gees have sold over 120 million records worldwide, making them among the best-selling music artists of all time.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/y1FscTOTZv1fWCpBauY9BEEIKOY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bee Gees: Three of a Kind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26455390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1FscTOTZv1fWCpBauY9BEEIKOY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
