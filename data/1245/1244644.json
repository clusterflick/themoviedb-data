The research for the film was done by observing and talking to people who have left their home country.  It doesn’t matter what country a person has left and in which country he has found himself, the general experiences and emotions stay the same.  The most important message that I want the film to convey is that everything is possible and home is not a place on a map, but a place in the soul of each person that I spoke to. The unconventional way of showing many people as one is not just a way of making the film more convenient to create, but a way to fit a much information into one consistent image, that the audience is more likely to understand and perceive as the author intended it.  My own experience blended in with the experiences of others.","popularity":0.3776,"poster_path":"/7KEwncDftMwObekXgWBjBEc8vEp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts University Plymouth","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This film is dedicated to all those who left their homes in search of a better future.","title":"\"An Untitled Film\" by George Alshevskij-Jones","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4536327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilya Romanov","original_name":"Ilya Romanov","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/lYfSou705Y2zzj22KNaxSP6ivlO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Speaker","credit_id":"65ccffd9e210230162c36dc4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4541399,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Gorbacheva","original_name":"Nina Gorbacheva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0a89520ecaf01632ee7c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4541399,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Gorbacheva","original_name":"Nina Gorbacheva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0a885693e2001634f0719","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","original_name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cce6fb4a0b190186cf40fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","original_name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccf0d84a0b190186cf4cc0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","original_name":"George Alshevskij-Jones","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccf0ca894ed6017c2839cb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31249044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hmM2eRL86TI2z5JIbNJ1RYvQwpS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3200}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7KEwncDftMwObekXgWBjBEc8vEp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1007,"name":"homesickness"},{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":3929,"name":"hope"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":33549,"name":"displacement"},{"id":170718,"name":"homesick"},{"id":250819,"name":"belonging"},{"id":267113,"name":"personal narrative"},{"id":328732,"name":"immigrant film"},{"id":350829,"name":"cultural transition"},{"id":350830,"name":"visual essay"},{"id":350831,"name":"migration journey"},{"id":350832,"name":"emotional resilience"},{"id":350833,"name":"cross-cultural experiences"},{"id":350834,"name":"narrative fusion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"An Untitled Film by George Alshevskij-Jones","key":"uBi1swqxyvE","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-16T16:18:26.000Z","id":"65ccf150e263bb016368984b"}]}}}
