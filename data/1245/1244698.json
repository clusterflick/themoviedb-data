The protagonist, Joey Ferdinando is an ex-cop, private eye. Captain, Morgan MacPhearson (antagonist), canned him from the force in 1946 when he caught Joey in bed with his wife. Lisa Losers runs the lounge with the same name where seedy lowlife characters hang out. The Lounge was a whorehouse during the war. A troubled abused young lady, Mariana Walker, arrives at the Lounge needing a job. She is murdered and Joey was the last person with her and is the number one suspect. Joey only has a few days to find the killer with the help of his sidekick Razor and the corrupt Mayor of Passionville, Mayor Hermann Paxton. There are several suspects that one by one, after Joey interrogates them become non-suspects as the Grand Jury is about to indict Joey for the murder.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/n53NEEYL386imFLvEZRr5TRXF4t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220896,"logo_path":null,"name":"DL Sites","origin_country":""},{"id":220897,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jolliff Digital Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you lose, you die.","title":"Losers Lounge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3883674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Boner","original_name":"Don Boner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ce2b5851e6ab01862033ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3883674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Boner","original_name":"Don Boner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ce2b64efcea9017caae551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5216881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Peterson","original_name":"Gerald Peterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d43faa893591415952a66","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0382816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n53NEEYL386imFLvEZRr5TRXF4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
