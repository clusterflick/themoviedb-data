How would that change you? Aladdin had the perfect life, loving parents, and his whole life ahead of him. But that all changed when he found himself living on the streets finding ways to survive each day. Even with the cards stacked against him, he stayed true to the Christian values instilled by his loving mother. Little did he know how a random act of kindness would change the course of his life forever. In one unexpected moment, Aladdin found himself face to face with the woman of his dreams. Too bad she was completely out of his league. Comedy and musical numbers ensue as their paths continue to cross. It is said that there is NO GREATER gift than love, but can their love survive the test? Be careful. Things are not always the way they seem.","popularity":0.1051,"poster_path":"/5licAKfChzXstzEh4xzI8sgYSJj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vitaliy Versace's Aladdin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","title":"Aladdin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Alam","original_name":"Natasha Alam","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":"/ggG6h2fpTGaSKkSCCd6ruHFDJLK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Karma","credit_id":"60f2cfb87b7b4d005c43fc6b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaliy Versace","original_name":"Vitaliy Versace","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/bAGJpSr6HqJLUMjEOCXCdcKO7W6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aladdin","credit_id":"60f2cf87ad87f7004783a28d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1804414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuliya Zelenskaya","original_name":"Yuliya Zelenskaya","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/7n32cl3yUCdzgByxo8pntlDRnD4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sidekick","credit_id":"60f2d024ad87f7002d013a49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3161323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Kuri","original_name":"Diego Kuri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Samuel","credit_id":"60f2cfdbdb70580075f01ff7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Stemer","original_name":"Irina Stemer","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Aladdin's Mother","credit_id":"60f2cfee4c2592005e61c844","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3161322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Knight Sr.","original_name":"Alvin Knight Sr.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Xerxes","credit_id":"60f2cfce1d78f2005d26ff12","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3161324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Enrique Castro","original_name":"Carlos Enrique Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mordecai","credit_id":"60f2d005f1759c0076559df4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079843,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David L.
