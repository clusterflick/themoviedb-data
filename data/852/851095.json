It tells the story of four families of different generations, who administer these alps with their animals in conventional ways. The modest life they chose to live during the summer also dictates the rest of the year's cycle. In a time in which society is more and more dependent on consumption, it's refreshing to see how a simple life can make us happy. Next to the ever-ringing bells of the goat and sheep, the breathtaking landscapes are accompanied by the archaic 'Naturjuuz' (and old way of jodeling).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hJWxbH7HcteTBwrfK69wzljGNzm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ALPSUMMER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3331212","wikidata_id":"Q96575960","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/hJWxbH7HcteTBwrfK69wzljGNzm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
