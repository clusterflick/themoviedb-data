Without them the NHS would have been in danger of collapse - not least during the current COVID crisis - but from the very start the story of this beloved British institution has been intertwined with one of the most divisive social and political issue of the age, immigration. The people who came to this country to work in the NHS have found themselves fighting battles they neither sought nor expected.","popularity":0.6538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":120019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uplands Television Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our NHS: A Hidden History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1997095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Olusoga","original_name":"David Olusoga","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/bPyLm3drGDZ3ofdHmWWCtpo3tky.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"60f14c75435abd005d60c322","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Kirkby","original_name":"Tim Kirkby","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f14c17d371970045516c56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15063756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":251327,"name":"nhs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC One","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
