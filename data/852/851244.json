The materials shown depict the lives of Buryat people in the modern city, as well as in the countryside – as hunters, herders, and workers. The mainstay agricultural animals depicted are sheep, yak and reindeer. We see city scenes – people playing tennis, soccer, and working, in the postwar Irkutsk, as well as an shot of a research institute - \"Ginzoloto\", which played a key rôle in the postwar Soviet re-industrialization, discovery and use of the mineral ores, crucial for the nuclear industry. The movie shows the traditional culture and crafts of the Buryat people, particularly their pipe-smoking tradition, and the belief systems they practice – an animist ceremony at the local shaman's house and a Lamaist Buddhism prayer at an unidentified dazan-monastery.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encyclopædia Britannica Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1948-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Russia - Siberia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13039118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
