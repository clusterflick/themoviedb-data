He tells the story of the cattle country which he knows and loves best.  With him we see where some of the finest beef cattle in Australia are raised - on stations like Edinglassie at Muswellbrook, New South Wales.  The film moves to the cattle land around the Gulf of Carpentaria where stock men and drovers handle mobs of cattle with skilled ease.  This is the real life of the bushman from the cattle country.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian National Film Board","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1948-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bushman Goes Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3159354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Bedford","original_name":"Eric Bedford","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f0baa97cffda002ecb427f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1826888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
