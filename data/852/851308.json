Impatient, he sneaks off to earth to find a body and, after several failed attempts, finds Professor Ezra Botts, a timid old pedant and researcher of psychic phenomena. Life fairly well kicks Professor Botts around as it does all timid souls, and he gets little love or respect. But during an experimental trance, he is able to leave his body behind and at that moment, Ek sees his chance and slips in, taking over the professor's body. The \"new\" professor is energetic, charismatic, and dynamic, and from the limbo in which he floats, the real professor fears that Ek is going to wear out the tired old body before he, Botts, can return to it. And just how is he supposed to get back into his body, anyway?","popularity":0.2417,"poster_path":"/A1rYe8oqq8FA21MLweeJGYFOeu8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1922-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Glorious Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Rogers","original_name":"Will Rogers","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/zzJ0FkSjISPUQ1QPskFaKwPJPr7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Professor Ezra Botts","credit_id":"60f1e66474507d00460aec51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Lee","original_name":"Lila Lee","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/2AiD7dau2Fhu8bE7x7vthdu9Ism.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Molly McIntyre","credit_id":"60f1e68449756000463050dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Hale","original_name":"Alan Hale","popularity":0.4132,"profile_path":"/e90MwAMkxjDqr3wOnOhDAjvylW5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ben Wadley","credit_id":"60f1e6a2cd2046005ff28727","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johhnny Fox","original_name":"Johhnny Fox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ek","credit_id":"60f1e6bd71ffdf0046f9405e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nichols","original_name":"George Nichols","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/ghGlmpjdUDRShrGZyG92sm3m5Hx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pat Curran","credit_id":"60f1e701b5bc21007389f5ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Rait","original_name":"Emily Rait","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. McIntyre","credit_id":"60f1e71d3c887d002c3051ce","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bert Snead","credit_id":"60f1e74b435abd0073f996dd","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1023464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Barringer","original_name":"Barry Barringer","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f1e7cf9c97bd00451960c7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","credit_id":"60f1e79b5294e7005d314b07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069379,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Woods","original_name":"Walter Woods","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f1e80574507d00460af2a1","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0013459","wikidata_id":"Q19363725","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5T5u6uPygbx96cIjFsbO348MSS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":867,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/we4hgnDHUfD4T336uvexSM74dCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A1rYe8oqq8FA21MLweeJGYFOeu8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1922-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
