This film illustrates life in the town and the work of the miners: the school of mining, the vast store of mining tradition, the old-time prospectors who still search the surrounding countryside for new and fabulous strikes. It takes the viewer underground, deep into the galleries where the gold holding rock is blasted out, and shows the intricate business of separating the valuable metal from the rock that is undertaken on the surface.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian National Film Board","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goldtown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.
