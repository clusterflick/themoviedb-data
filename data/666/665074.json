We filmed them there, fly-on-the-wall style, fighting, talking, laughing, being attacked by suicide bombs and sniper fire. We were with them until Raqqa was freed. And then we followed them back home – changed forever.  Every night, between July and October 2017, young men with no previous military experience pushed through the most dangerous streets of the world. They conquered Raqqa, block after block. They met death and violence. And eventually, along with the Kurdish and Arab forces of the Syrian Democratic Forces, they liberated Raqqa and ended the reign of the most murderous cult of the XXI century. Some of them went back home. We were there when they told their story to their families. This is the untold story of the young Westerners who left everything behind to fight ISIS.","popularity":0.1857,"poster_path":"/ruI5H5eGi8nUPpQKlisSJeI0zg8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foreign Volunteers: In the Hell of Raqqa","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Fra Tryghed til Krig","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Foreign Volunteers: In the Hell of Raqqa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Volontaires étrangers dans l'enfer de Raqqa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742921,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Brito Da Fonseca","original_name":"Pedro Brito Da Fonseca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e24148ccf4b8b0017f6196e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1957381,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Leiria","original_name":"Carlos Leiria","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2414aa397df000169d33d8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742921,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Brito Da Fonseca","original_name":"Pedro Brito Da Fonseca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2414b51bf2660012fa8623","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2038527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luc Hermann","original_name":"Luc Hermann","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e24149d1bf2660016fa203b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Joucla","original_name":"Bruno Joucla","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2414c11bf2660016fa2141","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Moreira","original_name":"Paul Moreira","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e241463bfeb8b0011d3714e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11455248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rkX0qWPCJJB87RFN7wB5KfxMpe1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3830},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8aiWxNJtBJZXtXYwmdQ2vLNOGB2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jYVFTbHJ3RHBofygRBFDjfjnRWg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/o165YTO8JfmnP7ZwhVrvgAaDqiA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ruI5H5eGi8nUPpQKlisSJeI0zg8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/218XUPtm1LdD6HW86SMLUvXT2C5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
