But without catastrophism, neither fury, nor melancholy, far from the sad passions. On the contrary, Under the skydeploys an ode to the energy of nature: the energy of all things, from the most volatile, a bubble, to the most mineral, a rock wall; energy in the diversity of its forms, from the most intangible, lights and breaths, to the most spectacular, torrents of fire; the energy in its states and textures so well extended by the composition of Martin Wheeler, the kineticism of the rustling winds, the spring of balance, the power of a monumental rest.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sous le ciel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Dury","original_name":"Olivier Dury","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e25ecdf5cd16e001806bf96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2830264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
