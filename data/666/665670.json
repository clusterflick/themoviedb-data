He lives with his elderly mother and wife near Mt. Aso in rural Kyushu. He seeks solace in a small religious group run by Buddhist nun Chishu-bo who claims to be the 68th descendant of famed 11th century poet Izumi Shikibu. The members of her sect regard her as a living saint. Yet instead of balming his soul, she riles his libido by playing a sexual cat-and-mouse game with the fragile Toyoichi. When she does bed him, it leads to a miracle healing -- followed by a terrible calamity.","popularity":0.5398,"poster_path":"/25eQV57R8QPGFfZiXF9B5478do0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seiyu","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shikibu monogatari","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eiji Okuda","original_name":"奥田瑛二","popularity":0.6399,"profile_path":"/r6fMqhPjBDPMn3oio1a2cjZzsnx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Toyoichi Otomo","credit_id":"5e26abc6168935001634558d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mieko Harada","original_name":"原田美枝子","popularity":0.9424,"profile_path":"/iONtBVZuIz8xh6IT3TmSqeDxt0q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Terue Otomo","credit_id":"5e26abe64ca67600173ea1f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyōko Kagawa","original_name":"香川京子","popularity":0.5194,"profile_path":"/q47wPwySJvhj6HQoYb7ON1TjbcV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Isa Otomo","credit_id":"5e26ac001689350018346810","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Kishi","original_name":"岸恵子","popularity":0.6561,"profile_path":"/2jSCjRGlI7N3WajaLoqJoia3qAV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nun Chishu","credit_id":"5e26ac101685da0019de410c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akemi Negishi","original_name":"根岸明美","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/oWE8EeeDOOMWFrgW6EPsAYdEnVZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fuji","credit_id":"5e26ac221685da0017de7035","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetta Sugimoto","original_name":"杉本哲太","popularity":0.5747,"profile_path":"/5HXJJS3hr5Q987afrPuQgEqSad8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Yumenosuke","credit_id":"5e26ac334ca67600123e6914","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550544,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Osamu Inoue","original_name":"井上治","popularity":0.3027,"profile_path":"/Vl35AgYxJL7ka9Wq7zDQyhyhOM.jpg","credit_id":"624bd695ab5e3400694bbf5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550543,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masao Tochizawa","original_name":"栃沢正夫","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624bd6603c3ab000a0aab021","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuo Hara","original_name":"原一男","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/eVcCt8yNWSbGKLWF8epCGpG6YlY.jpg","credit_id":"642a76f58de0ae00f4c0e1d1","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kei Kumai","original_name":"熊井啓","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/gJ6NOIpwpWipYuYJeGzG5Qsodzn.jpg","credit_id":"5e26abad4ca67600173ea12d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050795,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takeo Kimura","original_name":"木村威夫","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/rcSt4j460YuYtcEjoQleCCRxpGx.jpg","credit_id":"5e26ac9eed2ac200123924a1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550542,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teizō Matsumura","original_name":"松村禎三","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e26ac721685da0011de66d3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kei Kumai","original_name":"熊井啓","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/gJ6NOIpwpWipYuYJeGzG5Qsodzn.jpg","credit_id":"5e681c5c25a536001aca37f2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2562564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akimoto Matsuyo","original_name":"Akimoto Matsuyo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yqIrhYrzm6jwwBETecCdE5HYq8o.jpg","credit_id":"5e681c4c459ad600135e3a3b","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130253","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/25eQV57R8QPGFfZiXF9B5478do0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
