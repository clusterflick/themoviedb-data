Extinct since the early 17th century, these majestic, horned beasts have long held a mythological status, believed to embody supernatural powers. In the early 20th century, German scientists began a series of attempts to resurrect the species under the auspices of the Nazi regime; such experiments continue today in various forms. Berlin-based filmmakers Anja Dornieden and Juan David González Monroy use this history to fashion a poetic and deadpan 16mm work of fanciful nonfiction that calls attention to itself as a constructed version of a strange reality.","popularity":0.0826,"poster_path":"/5zO7yEhsx4oxyQyu4lfraMaKaj2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Name Was Europa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"그녀의 이름은 유로파였다","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan David González Monroy","original_name":"Juan David González Monroy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e260a312975ca0019edf8df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713653,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Obermaier","original_name":"Christian Obermaier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e260a805a07f500174bacfc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja Dornieden","original_name":"Anja Dornieden","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e260a285cd16e001606db3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713653,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Obermaier","original_name":"Christian Obermaier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e260a785a07f500174bace9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dECDmzxxJU5c7xsmV14IC2BygSm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":587},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5zO7yEhsx4oxyQyu4lfraMaKaj2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aAMbCQ6e87GpqSlhSHZQco8V06r.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rYaXrqGHlZe39PwcSGDKqe67NSC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
