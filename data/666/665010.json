Ramos, who had served an eighteen-month prison sentence for draft resistence, was interviewed by New York news reporter Gabe Pressman. Using repetition and juxtaposition, he contrasts the unedited interview footage — and patronizing comments of the news crew — with Pressman's final televised news report. In his ironic manipulation of the material, Ramos exposes the illusion and artifice of television news.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Media","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2514160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Ramos","original_name":"Anthony Ramos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23c8a81bf2660014f9c98f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
