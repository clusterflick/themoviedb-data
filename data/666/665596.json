Both flattered and impressed, she meets a few major artistic figures such as Serge Gainsbourg or Bernard Lavilliers. But the film is also about the cigarettes which helped to make Humphrey Bogart, James Dean - and several others - immortal myths. And about the cigarettes and cigars of ordinary people which fill restaurants and other public places with their heavy smoke.","popularity":0.1542,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1985-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem pour un fumeur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1554983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rémon Fromont","original_name":"Rémon Fromont","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd62ebc8abc00825f6b50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1959622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"France Duez","original_name":"France Duez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd63ace6c4c007f40f520","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1959622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"France Duez","original_name":"France Duez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd63dbc8abc007c21aaae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Berckmans","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Berckmans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd64ff10a1a008472d17d","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Sojcher","original_name":"Frédéric Sojcher","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd6218566d2007f294a9a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983775,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Nicole Mora","original_name":"Nicole Mora","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd65af10a1a008cd69f6f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572514,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominique Warnier","original_name":"Dominique Warnier","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd645f36a3200d2758fd5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":19696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Luc Van Damme","original_name":"Jean-Luc Van Damme","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638fd682fd140b0082deac24","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Sojcher","original_name":"Frédéric Sojcher","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2672e34ca676001a3e2051","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0276454","wikidata_id":"Q56301864","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
