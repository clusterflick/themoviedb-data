In 2015, New York's Alternate Realities closed after 23 years in operation, setting filmmaker-and former AR employee-Anthony Desiato on a quest to explore the comics retail industry from coast to coast. Comic book characters are box office gold, but why isn't the same necessarily true for comic stores? See how the 20 shops featured in the film are turning the tide, one customer at a time, seven days a week. Plus: Learn the fate (and future?) of Alternate Realities.","popularity":0.1667,"poster_path":"/3j1kbwQ0rAWWyO1UhqeFYuujDCq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flat Squirrel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Comic Shop Country","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Waid","original_name":"Mark Waid","popularity":0.2609,"profile_path":"/bXwe0oFfEidqoj6YgIQMKLSAmfP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e953faedc1cb400167cbb3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Levitz","original_name":"Paul Levitz","popularity":0.2523,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e953fc5dc1cb4001b7cae86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56113,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Robinson","original_name":"James Robinson","popularity":0.192,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e953fd8af58cb0012db97d2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Desiato","original_name":"Anthony Desiato","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e954002dc1cb4001b7caf3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10162142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4qkU3BzuOZAuA2VDV13qML9NX33.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3j1kbwQ0rAWWyO1UhqeFYuujDCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
