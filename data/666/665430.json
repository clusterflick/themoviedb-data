She gets work as a nurse and marries Dr. Howard Fleming, a famed brain surgeon. Supposedly she dies in a fire, and some time later Fleming takes a vacation in the country, where by some odd coincidence he winds up meeting Dolly, Dora's sister. Without realizing her relationship to Dora, he marries her. Soon Dolly is expecting, and not long after, Dora pops up -- she survived the fire, but has been left hopelessly insane.","popularity":0.3614,"poster_path":"/5lWHob1o0D4t2irU6FeSCM3L0dZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Effanem Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man and Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Shearer","original_name":"Norma Shearer","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/3sVqygC3vCn75JT5yP5Ar7uhfnz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dora Perkins","credit_id":"5e25ca711bf2660012fd85c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Caleb Perkins","credit_id":"61cf6da6172d7f008eb0964b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1487994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Leslie","original_name":"Gladys Leslie","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/hwVFhVpeOQZoY57viB2F2ziWjJY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dolly Perkins","credit_id":"61cf6db64f5801004249827c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna May Spooner","original_name":"Edna May Spooner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Perkins","credit_id":"61cf6dc61b722c0041263cf8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Elliott","original_name":"Robert Elliott","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":"/qYExhk4bwDE4nTRa3d6n3PLNFdJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Howard Fleming","credit_id":"61cf6dd6a6e2d2006645f3cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Hilliard","original_name":"Ernest Hilliard","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/yH2Kpkp5ycD1LBzRiy1iBBVjiS2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Walter Powell","credit_id":"61cf6de7a6e2d200418d88bd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634596,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leota Morgan","original_name":"Leota Morgan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cf6c841684f700422653d5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John L.
