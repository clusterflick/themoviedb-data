Although Victor had already heard: “Nika died”, he shouts all the same: “I can’t hear!”. Victor goes onto the mainland. After two days without sleep he reaches the hospital. When the doctor has finished speaking, Victor indifferently turns away to the window. All the details of this view from the window suddenly feel closer to him. Victor goes outside. The street is fast asleep. The entire town is asleep, as if extinct. But everything is breathing, snoring, muttering in a dream. This sleeping town is like a nightmare. In this nightmare those helplessly asleep are intertwined with the memories of his love. Victor wanders around the town in search of a person who is also, like him, on this side of reality. And he finds him.","popularity":0.3008,"poster_path":"/4dN0ebbsYjzdgywULxlPfiSYfYk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116316,"logo_path":"/qur3GJJoKp0EAJokvkLrRFOoSNo.png","name":"Vega
