All that is left today is a couple of struggling stores, enormous suffocating debt, and the desperation of uncertainty as bankruptcy is looming in. Director Gianluca Mattarese has been living in Paris for the last 18 years meticulously fencing himself off from the harsh reality of a family breakdown. Like a prodigal son, he eventually returns to his roots with the task of recording a routine of malaise framed by financial collapse. A bittersweet tale of family bonds, reuniting, and atonement.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":"/oq4lQAfDM9dy0D9HOGCqL8cL2S1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossofuoco","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Must Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3243195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nico Morabito","original_name":"Nico Morabito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ndLnDyUqGfjqQ6eE5wVAB1X6Aef.jpg","credit_id":"614ada82d2c0c10028ec738c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6ea723d3557001eee8dfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6ea796c849200212ab010","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6ea968e2e000021246232","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355980,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristina Sardo","original_name":"Cristina Sardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6ea9e9979d2002138ab80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647958,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabrizio Modonese Palumbo","original_name":"Fabrizio Modonese Palumbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6eaaad71fb4001fd0f61b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2392835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julia Kent","original_name":"Julia Kent","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/1kkF8rtjTq8ALta2dFimWHarQ6t.jpg","credit_id":"5ec6eabb85b1050022514517","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355980,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristina Sardo","original_name":"Cristina Sardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6eace140bad001d199fae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664709,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blanche Guichou","original_name":"Blanche Guichou","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6ead88e2e00002124626d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5752788","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":913,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oq4lQAfDM9dy0D9HOGCqL8cL2S1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":609}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
