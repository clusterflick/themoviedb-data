Video and television are central to her ritual of mourning, and allow her father to assume a presence after death. Kubota and her father, who was dying of cancer in Japan, are seen watching television together on New Year's Eve. The suffering of father and daughter is rendered even more poignant when contrasted with the everyday banality of the pop music and New Year's celebrations on TV. After his death, Kubota weeps alone in front of a video monitor. Awash with tears and personal pain, My Father is a cathartic exorcism of grief, with video serving as witness and memory.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/lHR289qNKlwzQmgGqJokaPM70o2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shigeko Kubota","original_name":"Shigeko Kubota","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa2c5a98d77c40039ad480b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shigeko Kubota","original_name":"Shigeko Kubota","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2458211bf2660014fae4d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3594556","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7bwjJ9hGKJXOMptUUu6IDB2KgOI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lHR289qNKlwzQmgGqJokaPM70o2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKsWgE3dvcxC61wY4FIu1Seimpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art: Lynda Benglis and Her Contemporaries","release_date":"2020-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
