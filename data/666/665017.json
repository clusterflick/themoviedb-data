This tape contains raw footage of him as he is taken on a tour through a poor neighborhood by a group of young men. There is talk of the Israeli Black Panther Party, and of drug dealers and poverty. Somebody says the tape is being made for the Jewish Museum in NYC. The Israeli guide talks about the movement, and says the bourgeois and the poor can meet through parties and drugs. They visit a woman and her children who are living in poverty, and interview her about the needs of her family. She says, “You coming to take pictures won’t help us.” During the next scene in a room full of people in suits, the conversation is about the Black Panther Party and the plight of the poor.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerusalem Tapes: Israeli Black Panther on the Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
