In a syncopated collage of appropriated footage (including a TV commercial for Sergio Valente jeans) and a young woman drinking Remy on a commuter train platform, Birnbaum calls attention to how mass media advertising uses a woman's body as a vehicle for selling products. In a stylized pastiche that she terms \"a snack-en-route with a pretty girl, animated trains, updated Bacharach muzak (Brazilian style), and pouring Remy,\" Birnbaum turns the tables on the media's use of woman as commodity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remy/Grand Central: Trains and Boats and Planes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dara Birnbaum","original_name":"Dara Birnbaum","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23ca7a8f26bc001177f2cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
