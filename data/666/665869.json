In the film, medical professor Dr. Hobbes (Fred Doederlein) creates a genetically-engineered organism he plans to use to bring about a more sensually aware society, but his experiments turn deadly when the aphrodisiac-producing parasite gets out of control and spreads throughout a swinging Montreal apartment complex. Despite the film's success on both sides of the border, the critical backlash against the film was used to launch a cultural attack on Canada's film funding.","popularity":0.226,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Screen!: Shivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Cronenberg","original_name":"David Cronenberg","popularity":1.3798,"profile_path":"/3xh4e2gWHDilMLtucHzDGsmJMuQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5e2767a253f833001a6b6d46","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103869,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Joe Blasco","original_name":"Joe Blasco","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5e276818ed2ac200103a9932","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivan Reitman","original_name":"Ivan Reitman","popularity":0.5666,"profile_path":"/r3uwtrGPGC16xD77ckpMytXpA1P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5e27682c2dda890019567adf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848143,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Corupe","original_name":"Paul Corupe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2767d74ca67600143f9ab4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tristan Orchard","original_name":"Tristan Orchard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2767cbc68b6900193e3d33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1173328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
