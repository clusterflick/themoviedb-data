The departure point was a belief that in Gypsy culture, as in others, collective memory is retained through the interrelationship of four phenomena: past places, past persons; present spaces, present persons. The challenge was to create a sense of these ‘memory spaces’ in the form of a film: a multi-disciplinary, multi-creator approach was essential in order to do justice to the nature of collective memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chuvihoni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Delaine Le Bas","original_name":"Delaine Le Bas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2523c2a894d6000f3b4504","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damian James Le Bas","original_name":"Damian James Le Bas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2523cea894d6000f3b4521","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
