A focus of the work is the artist’s footage of collective Kurdish mourning practices, and looking at how images of the dead are used in these practices. Sağ approaches her subject both philosophically and emotionally, and is driven to find a way of making work that is theoretically rigorous and morally and ethically compassionate.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/kk4xGcCpjyPDBptuwd0AZeslfFr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"what remains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"belit sağ","original_name":"belit sağ","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e27bc092dda890019573aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/buKeIRScXunfyVbJRUsfKPXUe9m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kk4xGcCpjyPDBptuwd0AZeslfFr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
