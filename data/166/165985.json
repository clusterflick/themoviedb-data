Pendulums sway, the small parts of machinery move. Gears drive larger wheels. Gears within gears spin. Shafts turn some mechanism that is out of sight. Screws revolve and move other gears; a bit rotates. More subtle mechanisms move other mechanical parts for unknown purposes. Weights rise and fall. The movements, underscored by sound, are rhythmic. Circles, squares, rods, and teeth are in constant and sometimes asymmetrical motion. These human-made mechanical bits seem benign and reassuring.","popularity":0.8515,"poster_path":"/85ppMKtbx0rNUVm2zyETqJ0CFoj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mechanical Principles","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Steiner","original_name":"Ralph Steiner","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54981ff9c3a368054b00170d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192301","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cp8s3VpAQnOI925VDteAh8sSzUX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1436},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n6sFkNgd5C6gNxS8a7sHRr8Jbwo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/85ppMKtbx0rNUVm2zyETqJ0CFoj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pHYEgAkuscac7ZtC4nYQlPZb1Rb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10260,"name":"mechanic"},{"id":33618,"name":"machine"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":209086,"name":"industrial"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285398,"name":"20th century"},{"id":292892,"name":"gear"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
