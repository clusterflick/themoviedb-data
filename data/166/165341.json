A moderately successful pinup model, Stefy uses parties, alcohol, and sex to get ahead like everyone else. But when tabloid sensationalist Evelyn Echo gets a hold of a video tape that could destroy Stefy's career, Carrie has only one choice. To satisfy Evelyn's need for a bigger story, Carrie must become what she hates, a bottom-feeding scene-dweller, and investigate the disappearance of a teenage cyber-lebrity named Jordan Rivers. Lost in the web of chat rooms, fan forums, and online vlogs, Carrie quickly learns that no one is what they seem in the City of Fallen Angels and it is up to her to unravel the conspiracy before she too becomes its victim.","popularity":0.6262,"poster_path":"/9K1qqmOPW3Ed8cTLducd24vjLte.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"iCrime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Fletcher","original_name":"Sara Fletcher","popularity":0.2677,"profile_path":"/9Y7TFfJFMd5GhdeZJRWjEEqG6k3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carrie Kevin","credit_id":"54e65538c3a3685b000000ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":211758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Noonan","original_name":"Kelly Noonan","popularity":0.1827,"profile_path":"/tC311bgpcLOX2NGJAY2FDEaf5Jh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Stefy Sinclaire","credit_id":"53b96e47c3a3685eb1005b33","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Brorsen","original_name":"Travis Brorsen","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/dwQ01KPgTAL6NuJyA91bWjCbxCN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zeffer","credit_id":"53b96eb3c3a3685ebd005a94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah McKendrick","original_name":"Leah McKendrick","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/6owpD5Jfb2CB7m0uOKsRoXLjcz1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jordan Rivers","credit_id":"54e655549251416f4f0000d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christie Burson","original_name":"Christie Burson","popularity":0.4515,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Raychel93","credit_id":"54e65565c3a3685aee0000ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Petrovitch","original_name":"Alex Petrovitch","popularity":0.132,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aphid818","credit_id":"54e655759251416f4f0000d5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Griff Furst","original_name":"Griff Furst","popularity":0.5908,"profile_path":"/kC7MQMSMockWSHpIkAFJp4LwPI8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Parker","credit_id":"54e655839251416f520000ae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Jarret","original_name":"Gabriel Jarret","popularity":0.2659,"profile_path":"/m353LQhbbxRcsECrcXkwX7uzKPg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Christoff","credit_id":"54e6559ec3a3685af90000cb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Goodman","original_name":"Christopher Goodman","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/dogOLXndPDmmn5g9ZCbnFnMIaZy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Producer","credit_id":"54e655b69251416f430000bf","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1771401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bears Fonté","original_name":"Bears Fonté","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1379b6c3a36862b1011d93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1771401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bears Fonté","original_name":"Bears Fonté","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1379c9925141670400a71f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1398429","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9K1qqmOPW3Ed8cTLducd24vjLte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bwu68eDPpOTRvVDwP5wBBXTo9xe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"iCrime - Feature Film Trailer","key":"S46KSawqlFw","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-12-14T21:59:19.000Z","id":"6481390f99259c011c3e9fb6"}]}}}
