This blatant rip-off of Disney's Mickey Mouse is indeed a fascinating effort. Not only is it most agreeably quaint, but it's remarkably fast-paced. And even better still, it's visually well-stocked with a host of neat gags. The superbly integrated music score rates as an outstandingly entertaining bonus.","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":"/5kFxyzhP4aAywDqNDkPcZRRu8b0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Office Boy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Bailey","original_name":"Harry Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c94c3a36847f82352ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/k6IX2V57VJ7kZGUdxlzvnbe0njF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c94c3a36847f82352f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0147106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xfk7S8Jbrv0QayuOgnVbbqwhsN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5kFxyzhP4aAywDqNDkPcZRRu8b0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
