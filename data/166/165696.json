L Company 42 Commando Royal Marines, commanded by Captain Jeremy Moore, was hastily sent to Limbang. They were given one mission: \"Rescue the hostages\".  Presented by Major General Julian Thompson, \"Return to Limbang\" recreates this forgotten story of heroism under fire through re-enactments, and never before seen archive footage. With breathtaking scenery of North Borneo as the backdrop, ex-Royal Marines return to face and confront their former enemies.","popularity":0.2591,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to Limbang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":526,"name":"rebel"},{"id":160992,"name":"insurgent"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
