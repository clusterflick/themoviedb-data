Roosevelt.  This mostly accurate privately produced biography of FDR is a cinema and political curiosity. Its lavish praise for the new president who had been in office for less than a month indicates how desperate the nation was for hope and change. The projections of FDR's future accomplishments and powerful leadership likewise were based more on hope than prior knowledge. Fortunately many of these projections proved to be accurate. Another oddity is about 1/3 of this biopic is devoted the life of the UK's Labor ex-PM Ramsey MacDonald.","popularity":0.3681,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fighting President","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin C.
