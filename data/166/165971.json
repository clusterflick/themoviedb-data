After the assignation of the Governor-General, the Russian authorities in Warsaw are bent on finding the conspirators. Ryszard (Adam Brodzisz) is a Polish patriot that is considered a terrorist to the Russians and a hero to the Poles. He manages to find time to fall in love with a woman named Rena before being caught. The Russians know he was part of the plot, but do not know exactly how much he was involved, so he is sentenced to exile in Siberia. But his sweetheart Rena doesn't stand still while he is sent away, so she follows him to Siberia.","popularity":0.1661,"poster_path":"/fKccn4Zwai1BXTu88kOaJJ6ilhu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1930-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exile to Siberia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Exile to Siberia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Brodzisz","original_name":"Adam Brodzisz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/a7eVkgMwpnfF6NU1UNGarMLZUMz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3afe0e0a263f4ac998b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jadwiga Smosarska","original_name":"Jadwiga Smosarska","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/92uPZGxgNgBbTn2Hqera4zocYYD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b05c3a36824971dd977","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2322936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mieczyslaw Frenkiel","original_name":"Mieczyslaw Frenkiel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b110e0a264fd1cb5bea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogusław Samborski","original_name":"Bogusław Samborski","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/33Zo1pwHZZD6GEy9ypap57iDSuP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b1a925141522bbe066c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mira Zimińska","original_name":"Mira Zimińska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gsKqD91UubNPo6jfc7slcFRLegw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b219251416983b95a35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2322937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Chaveau","original_name":"Maria Chaveau","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b2a0e0a26114ccb5d8b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugeniusz Bodo","original_name":"Eugeniusz Bodo","popularity":0.165,"profile_path":"/9LTYvTDkoJ8ZjXvx4Cp7HmIiIiY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b309251416983b95a40","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazimierz Justian","original_name":"Kazimierz Justian","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b389251416983b95a7b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Belina","original_name":"Jan Belina","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec3b4ec3a3685a161f917c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henryk Szaro","original_name":"Henryk Szaro","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f086c322b2b00512e84a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96285,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henry Vars","original_name":"Henry Vars","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f088b32489b005043bea9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121837,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolas Farkas","original_name":"Nicolas Farkas","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f08b37fcab300a6aa50ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2322965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Waclaw Sieroszewski","original_name":"Waclaw Sieroszewski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f086685702e00a5754099","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170926,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zbigniew Gniazdowski","original_name":"Zbigniew Gniazdowski","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f08eb85702e0067f3282f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361915,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jacek Rotmil","original_name":"Jacek Rotmil","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f08fc7caa47016c53caac","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610060,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Józef Galewski","original_name":"Józef Galewski","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625f08f3befb09009893eff7","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marek M.
