Farmer Al Falfa chases him away. Later, the old man chases two roosters up a tree. One of the roosters, improbably, lays an egg and throws it at Al Falfa. The old man climbs up the tree with a handsaw. He sits on the same branch as the roosters, and begins sawing it off. The roosters jump from the branch into a hole in the tree. Al Falfa doesn't realize what he's doing until he saws the branch clean through. Cartoon magic is on his side: the tree falls, but the branch stays in place. Later, a delivery man drops off a large package. Al Falfa is surprised to see that it's a robot. The robot performs a dance, and Al Falfa feels compelled to mimic him. The robot kicks Farmer Al Falfa in the behind. Al Falfa does the same to the robot, which causes it to grow so tall it reaches outer space.","popularity":0.1151,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Iron Man","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Bailey","original_name":"Harry Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c8bc3a36847f8233683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/k6IX2V57VJ7kZGUdxlzvnbe0njF.jpg","credit_id":"57c2f8adc3a3684656006954","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146942","wikidata_id":"Q55648698","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":218110,"name":"farmer al falfa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
