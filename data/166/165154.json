The mother irons shirts and regrets that the father never wears T-shirts. The father likes order, always knows best, and has everything under control. The mother prays and talks of her loneliness. The two are fundamentally different, have opposing views and interests, and have been married for 62 years.  Closely knit yet poles apart: this is the ambivalent standpoint from which Peter Liechti turns his lens on his elderly parents and the story of their marriage. Alongside conversations that shift from slapstick to insanity and observations of daily life in his parents’ cramped, lower middle class apartment, a puppet theatre is also established as a second location. This forms the stage for scenes between mother and father to be reenacted by rabbit puppets; as a puppet, the son can also react in explosive fashion.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":"/gAXCUO5LAUNk16OKFmpnp25M32A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Liechti Filmproduktion","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father's Garden: The Love of My Parents","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c85c3a36847f8232633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549568,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Eidenbenz","original_name":"Florian Eidenbenz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6341930de4b57600832216a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3731915,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Eva Ruch","original_name":"Eva Ruch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63419333d34eb3007e79e6ee","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549568,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Eidenbenz","original_name":"Florian Eidenbenz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6341930271ffdf007faf91ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441402,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Robert Meyer","original_name":"Robert Meyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63419321e8d028007a0022df","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71410,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tania Stöcklin","original_name":"Tania Stöcklin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5938efecc3a368784c00b44e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5938ef83925141087c00be2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abc0607c3a368439601b507","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abc06140e0a2609e101ba7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589645,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Guyer","original_name":"Peter Guyer","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abc061d0e0a2609e401ad1c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2741956","wikidata_id":"Q18688344","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gJ2AlYyfz6CgNn02HqjNEDRw9er.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2520}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gAXCUO5LAUNk16OKFmpnp25M32A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":988},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2152,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qZ7L7cfNa8VlOEB6qHZ9k4bUJVh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1434}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2013-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
