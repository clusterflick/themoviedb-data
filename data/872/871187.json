His story is that of an extraordinary musician, poet and teacher; of someone who has not only preserved but also added much to an ancient Indian art form; of a brave man who overcame his physical limitations to create beautiful music and inspire a whole generation of musicians and music lovers. The film explores the various influences that have shaped his life and music. His life also offers a commentary on the change that art in India has witnessed with the decline of the riyasats (kingdoms) and the patronage they offered. Lastly, the film attempts to draw one towards our ancient 'guru shishya parampara', as preserved and practised by one its most revered exponents.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/atFTjv2PDrwhquVPDDuGPcVZLif.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rasan Piya","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdul Rashid Khan","original_name":"Abdul Rashid Khan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b266281d1bf400d37a1c0b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3224496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niharika Popli","original_name":"Niharika Popli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6135dc415f6c490042ae27fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3224496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niharika Popli","original_name":"Niharika Popli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b266c0875d1a007d6ef269","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151962,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vishal Chauhan","original_name":"Vishal Chauhan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b266b21d1bf400d37a1c5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854572,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Akshay Madan","original_name":"Akshay Madan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b266a14544af00d34e1bd1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5090066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8NTeht5cPzvN4m1ZXiUoxMNgXxA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1499}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/atFTjv2PDrwhquVPDDuGPcVZLif.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
