The work expresses a constant change within Florence’s inner world, to express the emotional, aesthetic, and tactile responses that she has to Hong Kong, the city where she grew up. The film is both a reflection on the political and social changes in the city and an attempt to understand the relationship between city, place and the individual.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/tZuIlTAtkzFjkr27cyIGNhDbNTg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elephant in Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"城堡裡的大象","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florence Yuk-Ki Lee","original_name":"Florence Yuk-Ki Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64abc553e24b9300e32776b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florence Yuk-Ki Lee","original_name":"Florence Yuk-Ki Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64abc572e24b93013aba1050","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1010,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZuIlTAtkzFjkr27cyIGNhDbNTg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
