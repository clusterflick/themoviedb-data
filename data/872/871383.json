Yakut hinterland. More than ten years have passed since the end of the Great Patriotic War.  A 23-year-old boy named Mahees is given the task by the collective farm chairman to accompany the young teacher to a neighboring village. Aanchyk, that's the name of the girl, after completing her studies, she is assigned to work in a rural school.  It would seem that a simple task turns into a real challenge for young people.

A chain of unusual meetings, strange finds, bitter memories, disturbing dreams and visions lead to the answer to the most important question in the life of the protagonist: who is his father and where did he disappear to?!
