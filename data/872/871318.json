My dog Hun and I used to play hide and seek together when I was a kid. Every time we played hide and seek, I always hid behind the door, under the bed, or in the wardrobe. When I was 22, Hun died in an accident. After a year, a new dog named Bom became part of my family. At first I did not accept her as family because I thought she could never replace Hun. So I tried to keep her at arm's length. But one day Bom licked my empty heart and my defenses melted away. In my film, all the characters are expressed simply: circular, square-shaped, and flower-like. They can be anything corresponding to your experience. For me, this film is a story of my dog, however, it can be a story of your childhood or a story of your family.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cache-Cache","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tzu Gwen Lee","original_name":"Tzu Gwen Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6136248d07a8080027da97b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
