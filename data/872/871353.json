Because they feel like animals at work, they are just being used as tools, repeating things that are not important day after day without a soul. This is a thought-provoking thing. Why do we get emptiness and pressure from our hard work? “Line 0” is an attempt to simulate human beings as various tools in life in the form of real person posing. It shows a very regular and boring way of work, just like an industrial production line, which leads a repetitive and monotonous life every day, that just leaves this sense of emptiness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Line 0","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Line","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
