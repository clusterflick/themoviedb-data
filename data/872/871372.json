Their stories are intertwined: Fattah toils in Istanbul, hoping to earn enough for the journey to Greece and then Italy; Saleh has been living in Europe for three years but yearns for his parents; and Mamadou tries to hang on to his job and his education in Belgium in spite of having become an undocumented migrant. The result is a touching and at times funny movie about three youngsters who resemble their European peers more than they differ from them.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Becoming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2915202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
