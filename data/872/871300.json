For several years the two colleagues Stefan and Niki, together with their families, have attempted to find a dignified life and a bit of happiness in Ghent, Belgium. In the industrial periphery of the city, they take shelter in a rotten, collapsed barrack on the immense domain of the public transport company De Lijn, hoping for a job, social support or a home that will never come. On The Edge Of Happiness is a social surreal, observational, existential film that penetrates and respectfully portrays the life in the barracks. It's a story about friendship, dreams, perseverance, social justice, poverty, inter-European migration, human rights, tolerance, loyalty and ultimately fate. A contemporary Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' in our fragmented European backyard, in the shadow of the current migration & homeless crisis.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Edge of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3224678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wil Mathijs","original_name":"Wil Mathijs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61361e7de93e95002bbdb80c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5576028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
