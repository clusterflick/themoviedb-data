It is the only way for them to survive.  The harpooners are called lamafa in the local language. They are the village's pride because they take the whole responsibility for the very dangerous hunting.  In 2018. a tragedy struck the village. Benjamin, a young lamafa, was killed during a spear hunting. His father, Ignatius, was devastated, and Benjamin's brother, Demo, was shocked and unable to go hunting.  They blame accidents at sea on a victim's family discord in Lamalera.  Ignatius, the master boat-builder, decided to build a new traditional whaleboat to reunite the family bond.  The whaling boat is 12 meters long, made entirely of hand-crafted wood, not using a single nail, and is considered an intangible cultural asset.","popularity":0.4989,"poster_path":"/oFw8fP4NsWnP3qmbFtbxr9wTT7I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160440,"logo_path":null,"name":"BonFilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The last whale hunters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kujirabito","type":"romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignasius Seran Blikololong","original_name":"Ignasius Seran Blikololong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6137664a091e62009454e1a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilirodus Demo Blikololong","original_name":"Wilirodus Demo Blikololong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"613766630b7316004308b960","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clemens Boli Tapoona","original_name":"Clemens Boli Tapoona","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6137667751c01f0086639445","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625847,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Koichi Atsumi","original_name":"Koichi Atsumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137640751c01f0043c84d41","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3223468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Amanto","original_name":"Jun Amanto","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/3AXiW8IkPB1PO9zVm4QDNigTJWA.jpg","credit_id":"613765c0091e62002cead7c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bon Ishikawa","original_name":"Bon Ishikawa","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/5z1ew0qZqw3LBoPBAPdfoDac1yg.jpg","credit_id":"613760d7b7abb5008e9e0bf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2135177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yukio Hokari","original_name":"帆苅幸雄","popularity":0.1253,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613762bca217c00060117472","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daichi Yoshida","original_name":"Daichi Yoshida","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137657a51c01f008663931b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188128,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Oji Hiroi","original_name":"広井王子","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/v58WCODTPGNyqN8Liy2SljyZwEY.jpg","credit_id":"6165d8ef960331002b2395f6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noriyoshi Yoshida","original_name":"吉田憲義","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1ff36931ce174a2d9ca45","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHJxlluSbgFgUJeGbUZgVnBr6gz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFw8fP4NsWnP3qmbFtbxr9wTT7I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yBbRomKnhp6zv2UfV5t97yqKLnH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3737,"name":"dying and death"},{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":33829,"name":"whaling"},{"id":174617,"name":"fishing boat"},{"id":284732,"name":"sdgs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lamafa (The last whale hunters) English trailer","key":"RIGSeMS9IoY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-21T09:56:36.000Z","id":"61375d9d6e0d7200435ef447"}]}}}
