Harsh seasonal cycles dictate the course of life - and death - along the rivers. Only the fittest survive crossing the crocodile-infested Mara, the extreme drought of the Luangwa Valley or any of the many other perils harbored by rivers all over the continent. With cunning and opportunistic hunters of all sizes lurking in the waters or prowling the banks, \"Rivers of Danger\" is a predator's world.","popularity":0.4598,"poster_path":"/6rDvvcZhG0hSL9jjBAD9mcuCNuq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquavision TV Productions","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivers of Danger","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
