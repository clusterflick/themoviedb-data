As a documentary, this film delves into the current universal ageist issues such as being rejected in business and society due to their age bracket and its rippling effect. “SENIOR DISCOUNT’d” is a powerful film on many levels. Another is as a very challenging realistic Christian film with no sugar no inspirational ending but an ending to grab the audience to reflect on today’s society and their own spirituality. It is a powerful drama that continually reels you in which also subtly brings up the topic of suicide prevention.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/9a5jxUXicwTVPgtYddPAGlx89.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olert & Pennington Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SENIOR DISCOUNT’d","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Pennington","original_name":"Jay Pennington","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/tBUJIa55Sr9Z8zk09jk33GpvZtT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6137973da217c000427144f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerry Olert","original_name":"Gerry Olert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137975c2cde980062da95dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Pennington","original_name":"Jay Pennington","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/tBUJIa55Sr9Z8zk09jk33GpvZtT.jpg","credit_id":"613797455f6c49002c54aa85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Pennington","original_name":"Jay Pennington","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/tBUJIa55Sr9Z8zk09jk33GpvZtT.jpg","credit_id":"6137974d07a808004337b66f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12831394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9a5jxUXicwTVPgtYddPAGlx89.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
