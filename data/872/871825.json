The protagonist Maria listens to young men and women who report on sexual abuse and warped pleasure and she seems to feel the need to manipulate their vulnerability and rediscover her own lost love. Pictures of Tuscany and the sensual light within which the young naked figures in the film bathe serve to temper the darker aspects of the film with a tangible lyricism. In the end, the scars of abuse give way to the tenderness of the visual language itself.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/a1slnaFQe4EGdAi3MKazGxQnR6o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cargo Cult Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abandoned House","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria D'Amato","original_name":"Maria D'Amato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6137a125091e62006828fa33","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pier-Nicola Bruno","original_name":"Pier-Nicola Bruno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6137a1310b731600430932a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dag Madsen","original_name":"Dag Madsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"679185e18d1ddd930ab567f0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Herbert","original_name":"James Herbert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sxHhmOV569ZQSxP3czQYVnRYIWJ.jpg","credit_id":"6137a022e93e95002bc07529","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Herbert","original_name":"James Herbert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sxHhmOV569ZQSxP3czQYVnRYIWJ.jpg","credit_id":"6137a1439f0e1900430cba20","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Herbert","original_name":"James Herbert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sxHhmOV569ZQSxP3czQYVnRYIWJ.jpg","credit_id":"6137a1527a1bd6005fe42412","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Herbert","original_name":"James Herbert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sxHhmOV569ZQSxP3czQYVnRYIWJ.jpg","credit_id":"6137a16807a808006145dcab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0955821","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":774,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1slnaFQe4EGdAi3MKazGxQnR6o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":516}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
