It pays attention to the usage, movements, and possibility of variations of the diverse 'distances' that exist between them. If it takes a long time to move from one scene to the next, and if there are things that can only be seen after some time or from a distance, the 'time-distance' is necessary for an image to appear and disappear. What if this work captures this 'time-distance'? When a scene/image contains a single space-time, it might enable different time-space, objects, matter, non-matter in a far distance to meet, even for a brief time. Based on such ideas, the work connects one scene to the next, the voices of anonymous speakers to another. It captures the distance and the sense of distance of the things that do not stay and cannot be reached. By doing so, it seeks possible formless connections and temporary coexistence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Moving Fragments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"공중 조각","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cha Mihye","original_name":"Cha Mihye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61379f57d64ac2002c54ee6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
