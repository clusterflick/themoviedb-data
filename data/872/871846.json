In it, he highlights the importance of having a blueprint that asserts and celebrates one’s dignity and worth, one’s “somebody-ness.” He encourages people to maximize their potential -- to strive to be the best of what they are -- by working hard, by having self love, by fighting for justice. There are 8 stories. Each story captures different experiences. Below are descriptions of each of the characters.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/p4YqBBBddBFrMZYwlKJxTNp41sE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Print Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2261340,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Stephanie Brewster","original_name":"Stephanie Brewster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nurse - Jillian","credit_id":"6137a712cede69002a1b9aa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaquille Worsley","original_name":"Shaquille Worsley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Professor - Martin","credit_id":"6137a71f5f6c490061c9297e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Villiard","original_name":"Kurt Villiard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Janitor - Mark","credit_id":"6137a72c0b7316002acd062a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Whitworth","original_name":"Amanda Whitworth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Social Anxiety - Amanda","credit_id":"6137a73a5f6c490061c92a0b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Toe","original_name":"Martin Toe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Social Justice Advocate - Isiah","credit_id":"6137a7492cde98002b6bc0cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Arevalo","original_name":"Oscar Arevalo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Laid Off - Pedro","credit_id":"6137a755da9ef200445ef142","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3226028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millicent  Alhamis","original_name":"Millicent  Alhamis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"No Promotion - Denise","credit_id":"6137a763da9ef20090c3851c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505425,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Abel Garcia","original_name":"Abel Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"DACA Student - Jose","credit_id":"6137a77a091e62006829083d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Grigorakakis","original_name":"Peter Grigorakakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Manager - Bill","credit_id":"6137a788b7abb50043e7ce22","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deo Mwano","original_name":"Deo Mwano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137a799da9ef20066136f5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deo Mwano","original_name":"Deo Mwano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137a7a07a1bd6002cf92858","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deo Mwano","original_name":"Deo Mwano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137a7a76e0d7200624eb9a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3226032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Sliviak","original_name":"Jason Sliviak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6137a7b0b7abb5002bb40997","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4YqBBBddBFrMZYwlKJxTNp41sE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
