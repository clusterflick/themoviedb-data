In it, the artist runs for several minutes with his camera, making a tour from the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes to the stairs of the Biblioteca Nacional. The image oscillates and distorts as if the spectator were the one running frantically, an effect that -in the artist's words- seeks to speak of the Chilean dictatorial context at the beginning of the 1980s.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xdrZIwzW9PLj3YQs1VayWSSnSQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"1981-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panorama de Santiago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Altamirano","original_name":"Carlos Altamirano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6136a366da9ef2002bd22307","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":811,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xdrZIwzW9PLj3YQs1VayWSSnSQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Carlos Altamirano- Panorama Santiago","key":"WAEYBUoxGvQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-12-12T00:39:45.000Z","id":"64e795a6c3c89100c6823759"}]}}}
