For six months, director Silvina Landsmann, camera in hand, accompanied the staff of the organization. The many hours of footage have been refined into a film that dives into the heart of Breaking the Silence’s work: guided tours of Hebron and the surrounding area, public lectures and house meetings, internal staff meetings and media strategy. All the while the organization is forced to justify its very existence, both internally and to the broader public, and to justify its place in the political debate. The Good Soldier raises questions about Israel’s dynamic mainstream and the challenges of confronting it.","popularity":0.2857,"poster_path":"/d4xRGZ15FZbXLXOI9J5Z5deyHB8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172588,"logo_path":null,"name":"comino
