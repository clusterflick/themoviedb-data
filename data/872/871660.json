It soon became a social phenomenon in the 1960s. Former child star Connie Chan Po-chu fitted the bill perfectly with her doe-eyed innocence framed by silky long hair. In Girls are Flowers, she plays a young tutor falling in love with a handsome boy. However, their road to romance is paved with potholes and speed bumps. Chan's fellow former child star Nancy Sit plays the boy's younger sister who saves the day with her shrewd, nimble-minded plans. Sit's role may be small but with radiance from her glorious smile and beaming personality, she brightens up this musical romantic comedy like a fairy-tale nymph.","popularity":0.4682,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":160424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chi Luen Film Company
