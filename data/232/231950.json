The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: A trip in an automobile from Third to Mission Street, to Market Street, to Montgomery Street, to Sutter Street, to Kearny Street, to Market, to Grant Avenue. This covers practically all of the business section of San Francisco. The picture was made just before the arrival of the parade and gives a comprehensive view of the decorations and crowds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Market Street Before Parade","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0335286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1903-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
