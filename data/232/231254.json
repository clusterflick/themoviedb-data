We decided early on to take on board artists of the Montréal based label Constellation Records, which was celebrating its 15th birthday, to play stripped down versions of their catalogue. The film has been shot during four days, gathering unheard versions of an eclectic and yet coherent musical chore. This \"post-rockumentary\" must be regarded as a musical album, taking you from place to place, melting visual feelings with acoustic resonance, mixing the shared experience with the most introspective performance.\" - François Clos, Thomas Lallier","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2014-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And We Made the Room Shine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3613056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
