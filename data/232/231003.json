Mauro spent his days exploring some of the most dangerous places in the world and sharing those adventures on his Internet reality show, HOMBRE Y TIERRA. In January of 2005 he sought out to explore the dense forests of Belize to search for a series of legendary caves which he believes were once home to a clan of historic Mayan warriors. While on that excursion, he was believed to have disappeared without a trace. What happened during that three day hike has remained a mystery until the recent discovery of classified footage stolen from a Belezian government office. This is the story of, Hombre Y Tierra.","popularity":0.163,"poster_path":"/4XkuT5L61uFDp7f2VAzKhVhzi5F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hombre Y Tierra","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Woodsman","type":"English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Ripke","original_name":"Maurice Ripke","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/44klq8jQII0bh7sbZBfHdUhGuEZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mauro Bosque","credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82733d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Guevara","original_name":"Julian Guevara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Chucho","credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82733d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115673,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eric Garcia","original_name":"Eric Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Monster","credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82733d9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115673,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eric Garcia","original_name":"Eric Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82733c7","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard L.
