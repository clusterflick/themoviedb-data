The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 5. President Roosevelt on the Reviewing Stand. This is a great film. It shows the President as he is entering the reviewing stand, follows him to the reviewing position, and then gives a swinging panorama of Union Square, with its immense throng of spectators.","popularity":0.0498,"poster_path":"/dZzSsaHGN8MaMGx2A9icDgaeTcs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panorama, Union Square, San Francisco","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466917","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dZzSsaHGN8MaMGx2A9icDgaeTcs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1903-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Panorama, Union Square, San Francisco","key":"ry-7QPQlCUw","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-07-28T18:20:19.000Z","id":"6524f434629b2c00e264d4a4"}]}}}
