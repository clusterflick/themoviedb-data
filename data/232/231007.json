For more than 17 years, Greg Bounds has made a living scouring the ocean off the Brevard County shoreline finding trinkets and treasures left by ships that sailed hundreds of years ago. Dozen's of ships bound for Spain with treasures from Mexico and South America sank chests of jewelry, coins, ceramic pottery and cannons remain unaccounted for. Among the riches sought by Captain Greg are 36 boxes of church gold and 64 pounds of emeralds worth $1 billion. In 2007, he found $12.9 million worth of gold chains, pearls, coins, swords and other artifacts from the 400-year-old Santa Margarita site in the Keys. Last year, it was the top-grossing boat in the 1715 fleet.","popularity":0.2394,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17839,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Moving Image Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Treasure Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115663,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Cisneros","original_name":"Christian Cisneros","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f8273405","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115663,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Cisneros","original_name":"Christian Cisneros","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f827340b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":169521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Stewart","original_name":"Robert Stewart","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f8273411","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard L.
