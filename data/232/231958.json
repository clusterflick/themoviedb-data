The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 1. An automobile ride down San Francisco's busy Market Street, showing the elaborate decorations, crowds of people, traffic, etc. A very novel and effective picture.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/o1ax0tdRongZaHFMXFiCoh6z4co.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1903-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over Route of Roosevelt Parade in an Automobile","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3106530,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Herbert J.
