This horrific act punctuated a decade of escalating harassment and violence against women’s heath care providers – a decade marred by murders, assaults, death threats, stalking, clinic blockades, arsons, bombings, and chemical attacks. How do these events affect the personal and professional lives of abortion providers? What motivates them to continue their work in the face of such terrorism?","popularity":0.1641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13638,"logo_path":"/8e5pSWaPlwJiokyWn7r1ed3j19q.png","name":"Aubin Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Hostile Ground","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Mermin","original_name":"Liz Mermin","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f827696b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161763,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Raskin","original_name":"Jenny Raskin","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":"/o3EMS1cNq7dHpQSpp9o5fj2tggA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Gund","original_name":"Catherine Gund","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/99cwB8PDhx2cBASO0gQuyjq7i3L.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276977","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Verlaine","original_name":"Tom Verlaine","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/vtZl87ZwWuCdxUtD8t2s5A6gbJ2.jpg","credit_id":"5ddb2dc8aad9c20018c13056","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0416088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
