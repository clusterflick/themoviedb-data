Daanyik's childhood of pencil drawings and toy soldier battles in Moscow is interrupted overnight as he is hurled into the harsh reality of adulthood in New York City. Upon losing his father Deema, Daanyik and his mother, Meela, are left poor, alone and helpless in a foreign land. Out of desperation for survival, Meela begins a relationship with Tolik, an abusive man that may have had a hand in Deema's death. Daanyik finds himself trapped in a precarious web of torment brought on by his new stepfather, a lecherous Rabbi and a neighborhood bully. Drawing becomes his only source of comfort and catharsis. As his battles grow fiercer, Daanyik, at the tender age of nine, is left to overcome insurmountable odds to save himself and his mother from complete destruction.","popularity":1.3112,"poster_path":"/75jzeCANBrdkvRzrW4r97JCtZJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41735,"logo_path":"/je9Ko1f6iu0AfLL3dINJEaxLvEb.png","name":"Buffalo 8","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immigrant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hamlin","original_name":"Harry Hamlin","popularity":0.7845,"profile_path":"/fJZcgqLemEURV5r69XdTgjueghN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Deema","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276949","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sorvino","original_name":"Paul Sorvino","popularity":1.2158,"profile_path":"/1gF0UskusEdDcNaBDJ2CMsz5Agi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yeshiva Principal","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f827694d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Divoff","original_name":"Andrew Divoff","popularity":0.9355,"profile_path":"/7jdGolskoipA8HRJHjLdCLzc7Zs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276951","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lerner","original_name":"Michael Lerner","popularity":0.6188,"profile_path":"/1jRm6TRS5atQrA1VQSef7GoL13g.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276955","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Gots","original_name":"Angela Gots","popularity":0.2665,"profile_path":"/ywwXbwatRm2IJbak3AUroIfAiAl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276959","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1266985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Kathryn Bell","original_name":"Rachael Kathryn Bell","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/5mSX7VTuHVLBapxctC2iyevau0E.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f827695d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Elliott","original_name":"Jake Elliott","popularity":0.305,"profile_path":"/1YkOsoI3A6LIfu1C9Oy82uJOERe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Roma","credit_id":"5bb1802b925141166e009fff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Alvarado","original_name":"Allen Alvarado","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":"/ubDdnX3whzlNsIuQGR8mFDnwdXR.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Junior","credit_id":"5d59c06dda9ef24d828d3113","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Shurchin","original_name":"Barry Shurchin","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/n8h8BWnWkzTUrVDYttxifZnszdl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f827693f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Shurchin","original_name":"Barry Shurchin","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/n8h8BWnWkzTUrVDYttxifZnszdl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a36847f8276945","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2365001","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2232,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/75jzeCANBrdkvRzrW4r97JCtZJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Immigrant 2013 Movie","key":"zZ_b4NpiIQ0","published_at":"2013-10-29T21:13:58.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec720c3a368544800b663"}]}}}
