Each of these three studies was designed to be played silent. The first one, Disque 957, is conceived of as a “visual impression […] in listening to Frédéric Chopin’s Preludes n. 5 and 6”. Its title and its opening shot of lightplay on a spinning record not only announce the film’s dominant cyclical motif, but also evoke one of the filmmaker’s major sources of inspiration in Loie Fuller’s serpentine dances. —Avant-Garde Film Festival","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/1MzFR35Ap7Kv4G9qfOLP6fMnkUY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disque 957","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":997694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germaine Dulac","original_name":"Germaine Dulac","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/n0rxdRSsnT1CvowdjSq6If1AMal.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df8c3a36847f827716b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0132090","wikidata_id":"Q2429947","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qOlTKuTFf5l2k3YEJVzSXjYFzZJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1MzFR35Ap7Kv4G9qfOLP6fMnkUY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
