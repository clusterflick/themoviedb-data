Quotations taken from Leonardo Da Vinci and Herman Hesse. The sound is one of several recordings I made of the floating river ferry 'island' stations on the Chao Phraya river running through Bangkok. There is a double c.d. of the project available on Hipshot records. One c.d. is the platforms the other is a soundscape of Bangkok itself that I recorded as I walked to and from the different station platforms.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pcUFwG4IBnzS5M21rq5Y3vAchRf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in Bangkok - Listen Better","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Cooper","original_name":"Mike Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64305ce31f98d1022220cbe2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pcUFwG4IBnzS5M21rq5Y3vAchRf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
