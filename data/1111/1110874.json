Both daring and experimental, the film transcends all boundaries and conventions: It is a meandering ode to the absurdity and fragility of life, a profound meditation on the human condition, a dreamlike tapestry of lingering vignettes about past and present, remembrance and oblivion. With his trademark wit and sensitivity, Schnibuli crafts a haunting and ethereal hymn to nature's beauty and human intimacy, all underscored by the gentle rustling of leaves, the babbling of streams, the hum of Günther's remarkable baritone. Those who embrace this thought-provoking and inspiring opportunity to rediscover their lives in the subjunctive will lose themselves and find themselves again – a true testament to the possibilities of cinema!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/f4g5BEmz4ZwumxyMRjoDCgnkZRU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Good things come to those who wait.","title":"Our Choir's Trip to Großarl in October 2009","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4002303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabuli Schnibuli","original_name":"Fabuli Schnibuli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64332a5b391b9c00f45aedb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2109,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/f4g5BEmz4ZwumxyMRjoDCgnkZRU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1406}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
