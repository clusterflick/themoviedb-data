The only shame about the DVD is that it is so short â€” at only 50 minutes, with 13 given to the trio, 9 to the duo and the remaining 28 to the quartet. Still, with performances this strong we should be thankful for what we get.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/f3yPL5RxZEUD4O0LqwZa0FtHR5z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Schofield Live In 3 Ways","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rp6JFlFV4uFKgagA4ihBKO8vOxs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f3yPL5RxZEUD4O0LqwZa0FtHR5z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
