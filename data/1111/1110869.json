Subjects included Hawaiians Arriving to Attend a \"Luau\" or Native Feast; Shearing Sheep, Humunla Ranch, Hawaii; and Panoramic View of Waikiki Beach, Honolulu. His Hawaiian travelogue showed the picturesque quality of this overseas territory, acquired at the beginning of the Spanish-American War. The photographer himself became an exhibitor, presenting his own program at several venues, including the Orange Camera Club in May 1907.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/gLNutubZoI9hRUAno2NtFWVrCOt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1907-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hawaiian Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Scenes and Incidents, Hawaiian Islands","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert K.
