The same evening, his career is shattered when the owner of the place announces that he will not book him again, despite the magician's promise to renew his style with “Meteor”, a new and modern trick that is very visual.

cabaret.","popularity":0.1179,"poster_path":"/weuixwrbfQB6M2ddVodLj6mszSN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/oPCnyumoJtIedjQoQin6zSSHkv8.png","name":"Filmakademie
