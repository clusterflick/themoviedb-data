The Alikvótní 4 ensemble, led by Igor Angelov (choirmaster of the well-known choir Chorus Angelus), has been dedicating ten years to the reconstruction of the original (Aramaic) form of the biblical Lord's Prayer. Cooperation with Professor Bič, an expert in the field of Aramaic culture, inspired attempts to approach the authentic vocal form of the Lord's Prayer through the original language of Jesus Christ. Aliquotní 4 works, as the name of the ensemble already suggests, with the aliquot notes of the sonorous Aramaic voices of the Lord's Prayer, which gradually turn into ecstatic singing. We do not know exactly how the prayers of the first Christians took place, they were probably sung and experienced with the whole body, or even danced. You will have the opportunity to experience this prayer accompanied by ancient musical instruments.","popularity":0.1711,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2002-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aramejský otčenáš","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiří Mazánek","original_name":"Jiří Mazánek","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"soubor Alikvótní 4","credit_id":"64329a119a64350666c79155","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1526002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Angelov","original_name":"Igor Angelov","popularity":0.5514,"profile_path":"/6aQueOo7Nkp589FBUuFPuOg23XH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"soubor Alikvótní 4","credit_id":"64329a1e6dea3a0112e4bd35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Přemysl Žák","original_name":"Přemysl Žák","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"soubor Alikvótní 4","credit_id":"64329a306dea3a00b54f658b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ondřej Rus","original_name":"Ondřej Rus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"soubor Alikvótní 4","credit_id":"64329a401f98d10222219017","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zdeněk Novotný-Bričkovský","original_name":"Zdeněk Novotný-Bričkovský","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65646280706e5600acf12e26","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zdeněk Novotný-Bričkovský","original_name":"Zdeněk Novotný-Bričkovský","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643299c4e92d8300b6e50e58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":268140,"name":"religious"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"2002-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
