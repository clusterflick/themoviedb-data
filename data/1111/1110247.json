In these controversial shots, the artist was able to express the «unreal» of a society marked by the exponential growth of capitalism and the backlash of 1970s feminism. Between overconsumption and post sexual liberation, explicit and monetized hyper sexualization made its grand entrance into Western society. At that time, sexuality and consumption are intimately linked, and this is what Sayadian gives us to look at through his critical, surrealist and quirky eye, revealing the absurdity of American society in the eighties.","popularity":0.0625,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sideshow on a trip to the Abyss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":107052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Sayadian","original_name":"Stephen Sayadian","popularity":1.646,"profile_path":"/uz8vQhjerKAgTp7CMBncTM6olP8.jpg","credit_id":"643097fd6dea3a00d4370c6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
