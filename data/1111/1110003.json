Images of a wandering young girl are alternated with those of a man's corpse in front of an industrial landscape. The man's corpse is a metaphor of the worker forced to work dehumanizing hours. The girl, on the other hand, is the symbol of innocence. This is Luginb端hl's accusation directed at a passive and powerless society. However, hope is represented in the final sequences, where Luginb端hl's child, Cecilia, is shown as the embodiment of future generations.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/k6URjYYEKwb6c85p3dr73QKdsi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Senza Seguito Senza Seguito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2628739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirio Luginb端hl","original_name":"Sirio Luginb端hl","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/hXp4u7b8irWTnAMSDBN9aiDTLQS.jpg","credit_id":"642fea219a643506f1afb199","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k6URjYYEKwb6c85p3dr73QKdsi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
