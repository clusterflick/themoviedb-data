During a frigid winter, a fire in his wood stove spiraled out of control and his house was quickly engulfed in flames. While he and his family narrowly escaped harm, the house and all of his possessions were lost. After the smoke cleared, he decided to return to his gutted former home to make one last short film. Likely the first comedy film shot entirely inside the protagonist’s home after being destroyed by fire, Everything I Learned When My House Burned Down is a lesson in finding humor in life’s darkest moments.","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":"/qcA4XtO3g0OBlJUmVytnsUYiac.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything I Learned When My House Burned Down","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pickett","original_name":"Joe Pickett","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/qaVGmThDf5aa6TluTj5YQN25Cfu.jpg","credit_id":"648fad23c3c891012d5e70e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qcA4XtO3g0OBlJUmVytnsUYiac.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milwaukee Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
