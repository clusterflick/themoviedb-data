Schmidt (lyrics) and Harry Bannink (music) from 1971. Two fairies guide the life of young Frans. The good fairy wishes him that he will become a decent man, with a good job and an exemplary family. The evil fairy wishes him bad luck. Her goal is to make the boy as unhappy as possible. Both bring twists and turns in the boy's life. They accompany his life in different guises, as a teacher, as a cashier, as a customer in a shop, as a psychiatrist, as aunts at a reception. Their fight continues until morals begin to scramble. Because what is actually still good and what is really bad?","popularity":0.3358,"poster_path":"/wOxHeEaeyGh91CamUOzRyziEVVH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29459,"logo_path":"/el8phAL6Xa6vXvvaQNiELmEOgx8.png","name":"VARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1973-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En nu naar bed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"En Nu Naar Bed: Een Modern Sprookje voor Grote Mensen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":569308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frans Halsema","original_name":"Frans Halsema","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/gKpFGAxigOEluXhk91Rd206ht0P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frans van Ieperen","credit_id":"64306f909a643506ab780ad4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Dresselhuys","original_name":"Mary Dresselhuys","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/16NnDNxYZHtXr8CkrEsK7HwS2io.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Goede fee Sophie","credit_id":"64306f9b31032501036e81f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2146961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conny Stuart","original_name":"Conny Stuart","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hXUkQ3hXr7Bm1fn6TNyG7vQRaQY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kwade fee Marie","credit_id":"64306fa76dea3a0112e3f264","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Arean","original_name":"Jenny Arean","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/tAq6s4OfIr0l1sfAPmlKe9VzoVT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Barbara Brink","credit_id":"64306fb51f98d102a62a8211","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Koch","original_name":"John Koch","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Barbara's vader","credit_id":"64306fc71283e900f528d25b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hein Boele","original_name":"Hein Boele","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/iaPOwGDuEdygodlZVBsXfU2pGlN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bert","credit_id":"64306fd69a6435065ead1d38","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Lukowski Larsen","original_name":"Karin Lukowski Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Barbara's moeder","credit_id":"64306fe3b076e50077f8abe4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciska Beaudoux","original_name":"Ciska Beaudoux","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64306fe91283e900785985f3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mies de Heer","original_name":"Mies de Heer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64306ff16dea3a00b54ea2b1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Tactor","original_name":"Anja Tactor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64306ff7e92d8301130718f0","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connie Burgemeestre","original_name":"Connie Burgemeestre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64306fff31032500bd55ef42","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Theunisse","original_name":"Patrick Theunisse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6430700531032501036e8211","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Hudson","original_name":"Hans Hudson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6430700b1dbc880113f748d5","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mendel de Boer","original_name":"Mendel de Boer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"643070106dea3a0076bc9a9a","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merritt Chance","original_name":"Merritt Chance","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"64307017e92d830097c51067","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999280,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Piet van Zwienen","original_name":"Piet van Zwienen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643070ef1283e900985a2177","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie M.G.
