Low and Harder made music videos and short films together, filming on ice, in railroad yards, and in rapidly disintegrating rooms.  Low formed in 1993. Before the band’s debut record, Harder, armed with a 16mm camera, filmed the band on Lake Superior in minus-30 windchill. At the time Low bucked rock protocol by turning their volume down and the haunting visuals helped define their minimalist approach. As Low matured they turned up and the lyrics grew more aggressive. The visuals followed suit. Year after year Harder continued to film Low’s music until the band’s last show in September 2022.","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":"/kca4hPpGNUQqKdiuJwiJSki5jJr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cue the Strings - A Film About Low","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Harder","original_name":"Philip Harder","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6431906f1b72940110bda7fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27520804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kca4hPpGNUQqKdiuJwiJSki5jJr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7J47vlQHL34NmmP5NtJyb4LLwWT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1257}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
