This video contains excerpts of that recording along with other material produced while they lived together at 1290 Delaware in Buffalo, NY, including a shot that captures the aftermath of a hospital demolition filmed from their living room window where faint reflections of Tony’s face appear. On the sixth anniversary of Tony Conrad’s death in April 2022, Sarlin (Conrad’s widow) began filming in their living room to mark the passing of time and create a holding space for grief that could be shared with others.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[Six Years]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4001227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paige Sarlin","original_name":"Paige Sarlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643236fe9a643506f1b08cbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
