The barracks, wind, card games, chatter and above all, the waiting. Through the lens of his still camera, a young medical officer observes this small, faraway village and his castaway companions, collecting hundreds of pictures as others would fill the pages of a diary. The Sail Unfurled is a private account of a common experience, where sharing, friendship, life given to nature are not enough to keep the thoughts of war away.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197317,"logo_path":null,"name":"All'insegna del Buon Corsiero","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sail Unfurled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Apolli","original_name":"Lorenzo Apolli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6430ee88e92d8300b6e471ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
