The film is an elegy on the Assyrian homeland, shaped by repeated genocide, intergenerational trauma and displacement. It captures the beauty of tradition and ritual, without shying from a critique of the patriarchal values embedded in the culture.  Our Locked Door also highlights the tenacity of the Assyrian diaspora, being made on a small budget and relying on the goodwill of the communities in Australia and Armenia where it was filmed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9yG4egRXqNolYl91bE4C6IuTIDY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Locked Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edison Adam","original_name":"Edison Adam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eshay","credit_id":"6478c9a60e29a200a65f1ef4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angella Yaghoubi","original_name":"Angella Yaghoubi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ester","credit_id":"6478c9b2cf4b8b00e2d4945f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rasmik Bet Khosrow","original_name":"Rasmik Bet Khosrow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Goulyad","credit_id":"6478c9d59b6e4700c1d10e18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Amanoil","original_name":"Lydia Amanoil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eshay's Mother","credit_id":"6478c9dde323f300a7d47551","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aprim Yosip","original_name":"Aprim Yosip","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eshay's Father","credit_id":"6478c9e693828e00bf9d2c6a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Peiku","original_name":"Sami Peiku","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ester's Father","credit_id":"6478c9ec1749730135002d76","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninos Kako","original_name":"Ninos Kako","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Heewi's Father","credit_id":"6478cb30076ce800a82238ed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Oshana","original_name":"Albert Oshana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Akhiqar (the Priest)","credit_id":"6478cb4317497300a8181df8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Batoul Touma","original_name":"Batoul Touma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Heewi's Mother","credit_id":"6478cb53076ce800c50b0ade","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Tamraz","original_name":"Nora Tamraz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Saureya","credit_id":"6478cb5ce323f30127506f47","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genia Abramova","original_name":"Genia Abramova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Heewi","credit_id":"6478cb639b6e4700c1d10e91","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninos Kako","original_name":"Ninos Kako","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478cb820e29a20133c25744","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gagic Hambrtomian","original_name":"Gagic Hambrtomian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478cb9c9b6e4700fbf87122","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9yG4egRXqNolYl91bE4C6IuTIDY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
