(â€¦) The recurring places inhabited or traveled by the Woman are the House and the Garden, a physical and mental place that becomes, from time to time, a primeval Eden and a Labyrinth full of dark presences. The Woman walks through the Garden-Labyrinth in search of a lost symbiosis with nature. Continuously enters and exits the Oedipal Womb-House. The vineyard and the cosmos in formation and perennial metamorphosis spring from his own body. At times they seem to incorporate it within themselves, in a panic relationship of total identification. The Garden, the Vineyard, the Sun allude to solar and telluric symbolism, to the great seasonal myths of fertility.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tm9DvYFqDqKwU1ebcahTsC0uT4y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anabasi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3436072,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariella Buscemi","original_name":"Mariella Buscemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6478a6dd17497300de650b16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arcangelo Mazzoleni","original_name":"Arcangelo Mazzoleni","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478a6ebcf4b8b00a8766382","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tm9DvYFqDqKwU1ebcahTsC0uT4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
