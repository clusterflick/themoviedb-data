Their conversation, which is hosted by Brannon Braga, is fascinating.  I don’t want to spoil too much for fans, except to say this, which will give you a good idea of what you’re in store for:  Braga comes right out (about ten minutes in) and very candidly apologizes to the entire cast for the series finale.  No kidding – that’s where this conversation starts\" - Bill Hunt, thedigitalbits.com.","popularity":1.8261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urban Archipelago Filmed Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Trek: Enterprise - In Conversation: The First Crew","video":false,"vote_average":4.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Bakula","original_name":"Scott Bakula","popularity":1.1437,"profile_path":"/meZvcpXmcFlrJUeme4UpH4GZeNV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6478d9f89b6e4700c1d1121e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Billingsley","original_name":"John Billingsley","popularity":1.1465,"profile_path":"/uQzAvv4LUt57GBrYzDj5Ao1vhUT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6478d9ffe323f300e5235bed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jolene Blalock","original_name":"Jolene Blalock","popularity":1.0483,"profile_path":"/yiinZvN39DQU0SyfrOadbEXogAi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da07cf4b8b012274bc12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Combs","original_name":"Jeffrey Combs","popularity":1.0623,"profile_path":"/dfWcxKNsyGuN18GjWkbOmMhO4c9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da0d076ce800e646ce00","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Keating","original_name":"Dominic Keating","popularity":0.4335,"profile_path":"/eRe4BJz9fTztlRKikDRHhmss6ee.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da149b6e4700de8e91e7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Montgomery","original_name":"Anthony Montgomery","popularity":0.4798,"profile_path":"/56nYKjXlm8lii2HvS3x5xePye8o.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da1bcf4b8b01031d29ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Park","original_name":"Linda Park","popularity":0.9886,"profile_path":"/9yUfbbcea278H5j5KC0e54m1kLE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da200e29a20116ab910f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connor Trinneer","original_name":"Connor Trinneer","popularity":0.5454,"profile_path":"/tccLxyVboqzeK3Wf2daq1BavVmB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da26e323f3010613f563","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2556671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Xining Zuo","original_name":"Nina Xining Zuo","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/nLAgJqv8rzaFle9a8XPf9D5K7xB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6478da2e076ce800c50b0efe","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":429719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roger Lay, Jr.","original_name":"Roger Lay, Jr.","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478da3d0e29a20116ab911b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":429719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roger Lay, Jr.","original_name":"Roger Lay, Jr.","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478da5c0e29a200f98089b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262055,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Meyer Burnett","original_name":"Robert Meyer Burnett","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/tvVs4h2DcVc94rLAtIU6Mh2qdE5.jpg","credit_id":"6478da4acf4b8b01418de907","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262055,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Meyer Burnett","original_name":"Robert Meyer Burnett","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/tvVs4h2DcVc94rLAtIU6Mh2qdE5.jpg","credit_id":"6478da7493828e00dcdb8796","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3120406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
