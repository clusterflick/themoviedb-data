Employees and clients of the hotel, policemen, politicians and artists, will be involved in a series of dramatic events that will jeopardize the stability of the country. The police commissioner Javier Gallardo will have to take charge of the difficult mission of dismantling the terrorist cell before the imminent attack takes place, although he will be forced to question the orders of the recently appointed Minister of the Interior, thus uncovering secret relationships in the shadows.","popularity":0.2843,"poster_path":"/fGmYWddjl3I9zSGyNvTQkxKmxd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115055,"logo_path":"/p72tLLyf9yqlLyIBcc3lNVgsRNE.png","name":"Atlantia Media","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":167898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chester Media (ES)","origin_country":""},{"id":3315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Origen Producciones Cinematograficas","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":10015,"logo_path":null,"name":"TeleMadrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delfines de plata","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolfo Sancho","original_name":"Rodolfo Sancho","popularity":0.3045,"profile_path":"/cZyfkakNsGpB0S2aAoWkBB8M14H.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b09e0e29a200f9807977","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Blanco","original_name":"María Blanco","popularity":0.049,"profile_path":"/mjE4lhVwRrKztTz6uh6vhyJbrqg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0a5e323f300a7d46a92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andoni Ferreño","original_name":"Andoni Ferreño","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/jlBNsqk0hVxOuZ2EqUX3UzuAZyw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0ae076ce80149ee0189","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Fernando Alvés","original_name":"Luis Fernando Alvés","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/iLuqqbL9es4NXSfHYyOiAO2MBmY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0b7cf4b8b00a876687a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Shephard","original_name":"Will Shephard","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/2cOD5GF2IhkCePoB9xF3ln1jASR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0bf17497301186f9e8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2352926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verónica Mengod","original_name":"Verónica Mengod","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/7NcdAIkmuboiLXto0TU10uP1XNA.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0d10e29a20116ab80b7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1261472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Cantuel","original_name":"María Cantuel","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/f3V1GnB2eAToBKMA4ZECg89Qmsh.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0d917497300c13123dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":275949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Langa","original_name":"Ramón Langa","popularity":0.2721,"profile_path":"/xqF6bJrJOOac88IVgPVVl3fX869.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0e1e323f300e5234d97","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Antón","original_name":"Javier Antón","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/k8KlEus6cQeMiGjqSLMNdJlHqZ3.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0e90e29a200a65f13d8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Sitté","original_name":"Malcolm Sitté","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/6xk8QDgMIVugBev0tw6wXshtkdu.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b0f617497300a818129c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Félix García Hernán","original_name":"Félix García Hernán","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478af86e323f300a7d46a19","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Elorrieta","original_name":"Javier Elorrieta","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478b11f93828e00f9d60db4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José A.
