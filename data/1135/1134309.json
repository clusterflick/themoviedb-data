They begin to follow one another, forming a continuously rotating circle, commonly known as a \"death spiral\" because the ants might eventually die of exhaustion. Shot in Mexico City, this vibrant and impressive city is a protagonist, symbolizing a life in endless high-speed movement and the humans who are dedicating their lives to endless movement, self-exhaustion in a modern capitalistic-based world.","popularity":0.0955,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phillip Kaminiak","original_name":"Phillip Kaminiak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65973dabea37e007534cb7e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phillip Kaminiak","original_name":"Phillip Kaminiak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65973db20e64af71338c190e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509475,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sander Houtkruijer","original_name":"Sander Houtkruijer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65973dc3d7a70a128f69e229","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phillip Kaminiak","original_name":"Phillip Kaminiak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64772d0412c604013ed90501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27562750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
