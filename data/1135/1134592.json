The objective of Send/Receive was specifically to connect groups of artists on the East and West Coasts via public satellite, and it was the first artist-initiated project to do so. Part I presents an in-depth study of the politics and possibilities of using satellite networks to establish a two-way communication system for public use, as opposed to the industry-driven, militaristic and mass media uses to which satellites are currently restricted. Part 2 excerpts a live satellite feed between New York City and San Francisco.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nOlCEEX6YjV75031kcuv0fQ7E8c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Send/Receive I, and Send/Receive II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2281197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Sonnier","original_name":"Keith Sonnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647803dbe323f301275014bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liza Bear","original_name":"Liza Bear","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/udGUQcO0E36Rg6zMjH4vwYUZuYd.jpg","credit_id":"647803cdcf4b8b01031cce6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOlCEEX6YjV75031kcuv0fQ7E8c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":601}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
