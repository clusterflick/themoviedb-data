It features Tim Healy and Robson Green as father and son in a video drama which uses a mixture of studio recording, with stylised sets created by the use of colour separation overlay, location filming, photographs and songs (by Alex Glasgow), dramatising the life of a family in a mining community. Chaplin had worked as a miner and as such much of his writing was about the mining community he grew up in.","popularity":0.3703,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Healy","original_name":"Tim Healy","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/ykWm8NQkmXEVFjdmspC9zPL374t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6476ebec89d97f01337bbcd1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robson Green","original_name":"Robson Green","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Son","credit_id":"6476ec0000508a0133ecb144","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrina Carroll","original_name":"Andrina Carroll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"6476ec1812c604010017f6a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Close","original_name":"Joshua Close","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Miner","credit_id":"6476ec2a255dba0108414d85","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Scrimshaw","original_name":"Mark Scrimshaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476ec45255dba00a9a1f068","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2083075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sid Chaplin","original_name":"Sid Chaplin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476ec5400508a0116d5309e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089813,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Scrimshaw","original_name":"Mark Scrimshaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476ec6300508a00a72d48f6","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"As part of the anthology series ‘Northwards’","release_date":"1986-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
