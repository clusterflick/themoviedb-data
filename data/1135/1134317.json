The boredom that comes from the relative comfort and the slow decay around them leads them further and further into casual destruction. The film is an unscripted blend of documentary and fiction. Starring a mix of first time actors, non actors, and people playing alternate versions of themselves, most of the story takes place on a run down family farm, and we are introduced to members of the community that surrounds it. It may serve as both a neutral window into a way of life as well as a personal dreamland heavy with sentimentality.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Possum Kingdom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia K Yearick","original_name":"Virginia K Yearick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6477309e1f98d1028233bc1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Jersey International Film Festival 2023","release_date":"2023-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
