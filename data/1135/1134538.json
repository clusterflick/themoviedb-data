Challenging patriarchal norms, she routinely confronts censorship, harassment, and even threats to her life. In a remarkable fusion of documentary, cartoons, and animation, Egyptian director Nada Riyadh breathes life into el-Adl's most renowned works. This dynamic and fearless presentation delves into the issue of violence against women, stretching the boundaries of freedom of speech in a society often characterized by restrictions. Through her exceptional talent, el-Adl not only champions women's rights but also serves as an inspiration for societal change.","popularity":0.6475,"poster_path":"/yOPgzUIgbUvXoBjeN56T8TMzUgq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clin d'oeil Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":20618,"logo_path":"/yGDXyW0kQUMpraYo3f1egJSkxh4.png","name":"Les Films du Balibari","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":136525,"logo_path":"/mzYJyTy7fzXComNTOQ8Cdi4qVUP.png","name":"a_BAHN","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2023-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Draw Me Egypt - Doaa El-Adl, A Stroke of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Draw Me Egypt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Doaa El-Adl, A Stroke of Freedom","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doaa el-Adl","original_name":"Doaa el-Adl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6477c3f70e29a200a65e9899","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nada Riyadh","original_name":"Nada Riyadh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc8e0e263bb014a681abf","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Vandenberghe","original_name":"Guillaume Vandenberghe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc8c2ed2ac20186af539e","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Coen","original_name":"Vincent Coen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ccc8aaed2ac20186af537a","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanne Phlypo","original_name":"Hanne Phlypo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6477c3d9cf4b8b00e2d416bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nada Riyadh","original_name":"Nada Riyadh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6477c3cc93828e00f9d5957f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27389916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yOPgzUIgbUvXoBjeN56T8TMzUgq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1UJoJDn72XgliSFii7QNqwdNs2B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6w51VPY2XBjOdt7tnOAGdwYTnmz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":759}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1160,"name":"egypt"},{"id":6089,"name":"freedom"},{"id":2930,"name":"freedom of speech"},{"id":2134,"name":"press"},{"id":7272,"name":"press freedom"},{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"},{"id":257376,"name":"press cartoons"},{"id":264024,"name":"women power"},{"id":280910,"name":"egypte"},{"id":316702,"name":"woman life freedom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte","release_date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Human Rights Watch Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
