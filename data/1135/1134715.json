But the forest is a place not only of freedom, fancy and dreams but also nightmares, chaos and folly. This is the domain of Oberon and his queen Titania, who are in the middle of a marital crisis so serious that nature itself is in a state of imbalance.  With his lifelong companion Peter Pears, Benjamin Britten transformed Shakespeare’s play into an operatic libretto and wrote its beautiful, enchanting music. Sorcery, entanglements and distorted perceptions of reality mean that everything is turned upside down for those seeking love in the woods. In Royal Swedish Opera’s new production of Shakespeare’s comic fantasy, a forest is more a psychological location than a physical one. Under the baton of Simon Crawford Phillips and stage direction of Tobias Theorell, the merry tale is transformed into an exploration of the subconscious.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":"/lDVtClXxikIqtKPpsSTD3Q0fhYR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream - RSO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Sosa Dal Pozzo","original_name":"Rodrigo Sosa Dal Pozzo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64786543cf4b8b00a87648bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elin Rombo","original_name":"Elin Rombo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64786549e323f301275042a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Fux","original_name":"Robert Fux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"647865520e29a200a65eefb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kajlinger","original_name":"Peter Kajlinger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64786558e323f300e5232dbf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2437686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Rydh","original_name":"Johan Rydh","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6478655f17497301186f7ade","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091533,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Crawford Phillips","original_name":"Simon Crawford Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478656b17497300c13101f6","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Theorell","original_name":"Tobias Theorell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64786578076ce80128fbb4c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46873,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benjamin Britten","original_name":"Benjamin Britten","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/wChG0vkLBF1JdA2divUULyDIzAH.jpg","credit_id":"647865920e29a200bf1d77af","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDVtClXxikIqtKPpsSTD3Q0fhYR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
