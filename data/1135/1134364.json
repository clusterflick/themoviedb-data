But also to the bridging of the communication gap between generations, showing young queer people that it is possible to have a long and happy life.  What are the differences and similarities between their lived experience and the one of younger LGBTQ+ people? What can we learn from them and what should we aim to overcome? What links unify this 'community' and what debates split through it?  But more than anything: what does it mean to grow old whilst being gay, lesbian, bi, trans, non-binary...? What does that look like? What does the future, which is sometimes so complicated to imagine, have on hold for us?","popularity":0.1851,"poster_path":"/q84dxaKUBo2IrpYSTANAGEbM7N6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivre nos vies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Desportes-Guilloux","original_name":"Christophe Desportes-Guilloux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f65b06e0ca7f010de61919","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire TransLate","original_name":"Claire TransLate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f65b0eac4161013eb85377","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise","original_name":"Françoise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f65b20ac416100c4979d7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torben","original_name":"Torben","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64f65b28b234b900e3000f47","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Debarbieux","original_name":"Marie Debarbieux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647756ff00508a00a72d79eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marie Latifa Folléa","original_name":"Marie Latifa Folléa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647757191f98d10284723c70","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45HTmohAYzF55U1BOWaZaWVpjRK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3s0inQa1XlQxCc7FdrRNy1EUGD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/q84dxaKUBo2IrpYSTANAGEbM7N6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":164224,"name":"generation gap"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
