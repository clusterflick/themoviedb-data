Because when he accepts his fate and lives on independent consciousness, the punishment of the gods on him no longer makes sense, and the meaningless punishment is no longer in vain. The film cites the philosophy-mythology, where the three characters played the same role, the crowd. Their unrelated daily lives are like destiny and cycle, without beginning and ending, without joy or sorrow. They share the same memory of counting down numbers repeatedly and begin a karma through the passing of a boulder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zdMs2XVbcRhWGijX7LvgJBw5KAO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five, Four, Three, Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Chia-Yun","original_name":"Wu Chia-Yun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64773047d37197013346aa3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zdMs2XVbcRhWGijX7LvgJBw5KAO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1772}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
