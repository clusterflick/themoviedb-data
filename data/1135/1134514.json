Sillart's work was acknowledged in Estonia, in the former Soviet Union and abroad. Jüri was a sharp personality with a curious mind. Life with all its manifestations was a great source of inspiration for him - everyday events, painting, photography, history of various religions, philosophical and esoterical literature, history, astronomy, mathematics - he was interested in all of this. His colleagues, students and close ones share their memories in the documentary. There are excerpts from films that Jüri Sillart has added his creative contribution to.","popularity":0.1312,"poster_path":"/ttA8J4SrVuCADdF6uw7O0U7LPJ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jüri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Moon Hunter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jüri Sillart","original_name":"Jüri Sillart","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/s26s4bl3B32t3AJg4LYOGrIJh8v.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6477b63d1749730135ffaa20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3591461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tiina Lokk","original_name":"Tiina Lokk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yPoVLIn6WUzlhYy5x4Be9IxGSk4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6477b64a17497300fb39066e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403027,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mait Mäekivi","original_name":"Mait Mäekivi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/m5LxuFcv4AJVxFveYB3b5xBnMkZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6477b656e323f300c4284be6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264710,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martin Männik","original_name":"Martin Männik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/44A6gAfqgsuM1uHrObP1ZL1GGy7.jpg","credit_id":"6477b50a17497301186f1a8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arko Okk","original_name":"Arko Okk","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6477b4ef0e29a20116aafbec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Sillart","original_name":"Julia Sillart","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6477b4cf93828e011622ac46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1288,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/ttA8J4SrVuCADdF6uw7O0U7LPJ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":916}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"et","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
