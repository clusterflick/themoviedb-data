The film begins with a flight of fast clouds in the sky, with their elusive shapes, which capture and make the smoke of Etna cloud, like if heaven and earth were caught in a single, unstoppable flight. But here it is Mazzoleni's own eye, which emerges several times, that disrupts the visible. Inside and outside are mixed: bodies, totemic and vegetable masks. Reality decomposes, reveals its hidden colors, those that are hidden in the heart of things at the time of creation, according to a myth of Lurian Kabbalah. Clouds, a meadow blown by the wind, the moving shadow of a room: everything escapes again, elusive. But the eye of the machine, but the eye behind the machine, also catches a naked and unarmed eye that appears among things: the seer is also what he sees. I is another. I is also a thing among things.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/aI3FHHH1dhwm8PTIiK1tKqlBXNa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Body To Cosmos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3436072,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariella Buscemi","original_name":"Mariella Buscemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6478b56693828e01337679f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arcangelo Mazzoleni","original_name":"Arcangelo Mazzoleni","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478a8ea93828e00a7634110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aI3FHHH1dhwm8PTIiK1tKqlBXNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
