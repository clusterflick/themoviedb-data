Amina is to be the lucky one this time. The groom Elvino, however, soon turns his attention back to his former wife because Amina sleepwalks into the bed of a stranger who has just arrived. Count Rodolfo, son of the former lord of the manor and travelling incognito, cannot convince the villagers of his innocence nor that of Amina, until she sleepwalks again and the collective belief in the supernatural is put to the test.  Deutsche Oper am Rhein’s new production is conducted by bel canto specialist and Principal Guest Conductor Antonino Fogliani and is directed by Johannes Erath, whose poetically subtle stagings have been seen in Munich, Frankfurt, Vienna, Palermo and beyond.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/snFnQZC1bgwvJVCLxXenI7G1BAb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Sonnambula - BELLINI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3725232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogdan Taloș","original_name":"Bogdan Taloș","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64786c2c93828e0133765aa0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarzyna Kuncio","original_name":"Katarzyna Kuncio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64786c33e323f300a7d44f16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4091549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Alleaume","original_name":"Stacey Alleaume","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qmHBuO1km4YLhzorCgem7ZrUrXO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64786c39e323f3010613cb9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgardo Rocha","original_name":"Edgardo Rocha","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6uD64Tb6Y6tlXjg4JtHrM8YJGPY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64786c4317497300c1310504","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Elisabeth Meier","original_name":"Heidi Elisabeth Meier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64786c4993828e00bf9d030c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonino Fogliani","original_name":"Antonino Fogliani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64786c55076ce800a8220f45","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Erath","original_name":"Johannes Erath","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64786c5f93828e0133765abb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/snFnQZC1bgwvJVCLxXenI7G1BAb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LA SONNAMBULA Bellini – Deutsche Oper am Rhein","key":"_rVVxQf3J5U","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-04-21T17:00:10.000Z","id":"64786c1de323f300c428ab5d"}]}}}
