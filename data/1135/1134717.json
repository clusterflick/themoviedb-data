Here we focus on the amorous and political intrigues surrounding the annulment of Henry's first marriage to Catherine of Aragon in favour of his new passion for Anne Boleyn.  Henry VIII, a grand historical opera by Camille Saint-Saëns, is characterised by stark contrasts: ardour and modesty, jealousy and renunciation, intimacy and solemnity. La Monnaie in Brussels have entrusted their new production to director Olivier Py and conductor Alain Altinoglu, two fervent champions of the French repertoire. With magnificent sets, high drama and compelling music, this production offers a musical journey which starts in sixteenth century England but still resonates today through a timeless question: How far can a man of power go with his conquests?","popularity":0.0603,"poster_path":"/5fYzK0mukRtDg6mxiAoMqwaq506.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henry VIII - SAINT-SAËNS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Lhote","original_name":"Lionel Lhote","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"647867380e29a20116ab5d0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Lyon","original_name":"Ed Lyon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64786741e323f300e5232eba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Le Texier","original_name":"Vincent Le Texier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64786748cf4b8b00c3d0d63d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enguerrand de Hys","original_name":"Enguerrand de Hys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6478674fcf4b8b01418db521","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Van Mechelen","original_name":"Werner Van Mechelen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64786757cf4b8b01031cfa2d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Altinoglu","original_name":"Alain Altinoglu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478676717497301186f7bf5","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Py","original_name":"Olivier Py","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478677293828e00dcdb5702","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5fYzK0mukRtDg6mxiAoMqwaq506.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
