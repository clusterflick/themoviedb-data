Delivering humanitarian aid, rescuing our soldiers from encirclement, providing medical aid, cooking for the fighters or just for the cats of Moshchun - all of these are big and small personal feats which inspire us and give us strength to continue fighting. Apart from astonishing stories, the testimony of the residents of the Kyiv Region can help with future investigations and eventually help punish the Russians.","popularity":0.1122,"poster_path":"/nB4TnCvZbUx1sj7R4dNPWZfuOZ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witnesses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Свідки","type":"festival Ukrainian title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Bondarchuk","original_name":"Роман Бондарчук","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/bJhtE7H5rLr20pVT9d82RZOuSfm.jpg","credit_id":"651bee07c50ad200ad8204ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3460478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetiana Symon","original_name":"Тетяна Симон","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wFad6LJC8LAX1nZELJOGs0YRM3a.jpg","credit_id":"651bedf874507d00ac4679d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3370725,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roman Synchuk","original_name":"Roman Synchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xWuUHvISz7OMpdc61q63k33IX7B.jpg","credit_id":"651bee30223a8b00e1fb4b89","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3370725,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roman Synchuk","original_name":"Roman Synchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xWuUHvISz7OMpdc61q63k33IX7B.jpg","credit_id":"651bee3c223a8b00ab3d376b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3460478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetiana Symon","original_name":"Тетяна Симон","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wFad6LJC8LAX1nZELJOGs0YRM3a.jpg","credit_id":"6478a6c71749730135001da2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27917371","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/nB4TnCvZbUx1sj7R4dNPWZfuOZ1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zh5TAYrvXg5IKyhG2wvD9VUsere.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
