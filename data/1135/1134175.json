The film  introduces us to Bobby Thompson, a musician whose fleeting success in country music has trailed off to small town bars where the alcoholic singer shakily holds things together. Barely responsible for himself, Bobby's hazy life comes into sharp focus when a old fan stops by and leaves her twelve year old daughter with him, swearing he's the father. We see father and potential daughter cautiously size each other up in his beat-up motel apartment while they wait the 10 days for the DNA results in the mail.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/wwDu6JeYqDVbcjHlX4PXC6Wlb5q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HELL OF A HEARTACHE","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Burson","original_name":"Robert Burson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bobby Thompson","credit_id":"6476b9e11f98d102858a2138","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erica Van Parys","original_name":"Erica Van Parys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Amy Aberdeen","credit_id":"6476ba1e1f98d1028471f57c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genesis Van Parys","original_name":"Genesis Van Parys","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"6476ba9112c60400a7b30677","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaunn Cochran","original_name":"Shaunn Cochran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"6476baac706b9f00dbdaba95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie King","original_name":"Robbie King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"6476bacc12c60400c2bfc277","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matt Taylor","original_name":"Matt Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476bb8c255dba0129cdfdc5","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089667,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Victoria Rincon","original_name":"Victoria Rincon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476bbf4255dba014a0790ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Owens","original_name":"Katie Owens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476bc3000508a00bfcbb957","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Burson","original_name":"Robert Burson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476bb1f706b9f00a661d357","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089660,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Burson","original_name":"Robert Burson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476bb651f98d1028471f652","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4089670,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brendan Rincon","original_name":"Brendan Rincon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476bc71706b9f00bea8f3a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12396982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wwDu6JeYqDVbcjHlX4PXC6Wlb5q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"filmed around Sedona, Arizona","release_date":"2020-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
