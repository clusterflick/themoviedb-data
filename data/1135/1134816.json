In the \"descent into hell\" of consciousness, Aurélia ends up by detaching herself from her identity as a woman of today to take on the multiple features prefigured, from time to time, by her imagination. Aurélia's frenetic final dance serves as a ceremony to exorcise evil, the furious rediscovery of the “double” savage buried within each of us, the abrupt awakening of the possessed bacchant, liberated vitalism, myth, explosion of fantastic energies. Aurélia faces a discourse on filmic time: real time is decomposed analyzed accelerated in lightning-fast mental paths from a stream of consciousness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4FrA2dKhjYOroOtsIoOfeXpn6ug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Dream is a second life","title":"Aurélia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3436072,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariella Buscemi","original_name":"Mariella Buscemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6478a61893828e00f9d60846","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arcangelo Mazzoleni","original_name":"Arcangelo Mazzoleni","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478a62717497301186f98b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4FrA2dKhjYOroOtsIoOfeXpn6ug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
