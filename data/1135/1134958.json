Twenty-seven-year-old Jenny Tanner was found dead in the living room of her country home in November 1984 - shot twice in the head and hands, with her husband's bolt-action rifle between her knees. The initial police investigation ignored or destroyed vital forensic evidence and despite compelling personal accounts of a happy and optimistic young wife and mother, the verdict was suicide. Thanks to the efforts of journalist Andrew Rule, the suicide verdict has been quashed and a new murder investigation opened.","popularity":0.0936,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Death in the Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248115,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terry Carlyon","original_name":"Terry Carlyon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479064bcaef2d00fce48859","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robyn Miller","original_name":"Robyn Miller","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647906560e29a200dcb9c146","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0266451","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
