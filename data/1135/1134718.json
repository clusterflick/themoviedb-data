En route they meet a young sympathiser who offers to be their guide, but when they return to Moscow, they confess to his killing. When is it right to kill?  Birmingham Opera Company presents The Decision, a visceral, rarely performed work by writer Bertolt Brecht and composer Hanns Eisler. Here artistic, moral and social challenges come hand in hand. Living through a period of intolerance and censorship in the 1920s and 30s, Brecht and Eisler were both banned by the Nazis. Later, in their new adopted home on the other side of the Atlantic, the pair were investigated by the House Committee of Un-American Activities. Now in the 2020s, Brecht’s ‘learning play’ The Decision still has the potency to provoke. Birmingham's production is described by The Stage as ‘impressive, immersive’ and by The Spectator ‘as an encounter with a genuinely evil work of art.’","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/cIm0wovR5OJDj1HXARGuMdJtBZW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Decision – BOC","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimee Berwick","original_name":"Aimee Berwick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"647869d30e29a200bf1d79b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paksie Vernon","original_name":"Paksie Vernon","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"647869decf4b8b01418db639","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3371586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Therese Collins","original_name":"Therese Collins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"647869e9e323f300a7d44df6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1776553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Dawn Thompson","original_name":"Wendy Dawn Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"647869f2076ce800a8220e29","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antony Almeida","original_name":"Antony Almeida","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64786a00cf4b8b00e2d46b4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092265,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alpesh Chauhan","original_name":"Alpesh Chauhan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64786a0acf4b8b01418db64c","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11632,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanns Eisler","original_name":"Hanns Eisler","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/wtV0rzTPS5npiEN3JeXsb2czTFa.jpg","credit_id":"64786a1993828e00dcdb584a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cIm0wovR5OJDj1HXARGuMdJtBZW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
