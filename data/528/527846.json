Featuring extensive footage and B-roll film from Calgary Pride in the 90â€™s, queer leaders recount a decade of turmoil, loss, and growth of activism and human rights. The film is a first-hand account of the frontlines of LGBTQ2+ activism at a time when the right to be out in Alberta was not legally protected, visible or developed. Spanning stories from 1960-present day, this feature length documentary delves into the moments and victories which brought an entire community from the darkness into the light.","popularity":0.4273,"poster_path":"/vAo7485avf4SOXTqze5v1X0zxRh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outliers: Calgary's Queer History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justine Boncezk","original_name":"Justine Boncezk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b123aec0e0a263de6001441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Schmidt","original_name":"Leah Schmidt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b123af8c3a368629e000f2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Demers","original_name":"James Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b123b00c3a3686292001fa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dEHNGbiYCLjdOPCEYzxhPvNOj5N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.689,"height":1385,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vAo7485avf4SOXTqze5v1X0zxRh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":954}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156501,"name":"pride"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":207958,"name":"queer activism"},{"id":234528,"name":"calgary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
