From the musical performances of Arrigo Barnabé to the pioneer comic book Balão (Baloon), the movie approaches the experimentation in the work of a generation of Brazilian artists and the way in which the humor and the horrors of their reality were presented in their compositions. In a quite similar way as the productions themselves, the short movie has an independent and creative approach too, using the own interviewees to narrate and intervene in the film's narrative.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fury Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nana Maiolini","original_name":"Nana Maiolini","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1da62e0e0a264fb3003fe9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5684344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
