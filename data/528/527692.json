At that time, Laird Hamilton and his gang had just invented tow surfing, using the help of jet skis to catch giant waves on the outer reefs. Laird became a legend and his new sport attracted surfers looking for fame and money. Then, in 2006, dreaming of surfing Jaws in the purest style, the 3 “amigos” began a saga that lasted 5 years. They challenged Jaws year after year, paddling, with no safety, no inflatable vests, nothing.","popularity":0.0703,"poster_path":"/tHGqUrzodT3JK71eIWndj5fwYil.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Conquest of Jaws","title":"Mad Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danilo Couto","original_name":"Danilo Couto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b1111f00e0a26308001223d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcio Freire","original_name":"Marcio Freire","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b1112c00e0a2630680117b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Soledade","original_name":"Yuri Soledade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b1113000e0a26308b0109a2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Studart","original_name":"Roberto Studart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1111bb9251415eb100cbe5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eduardo Sampaio","original_name":"Eduardo Sampaio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1111cfc3a368623c018a44","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Studart","original_name":"Roberto Studart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b11118dc3a36862210096e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Studart","original_name":"Roberto Studart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1111aa9251415ed200fe94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tHGqUrzodT3JK71eIWndj5fwYil.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5349,"name":"surfing"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1668,"name":"hawaii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Santa Barbara International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mad Dogs - Official Trailer","key":"f_GOc4mSO58","published_at":"2016-05-12T20:54:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b1113ff9251415ef1011f98"}]}}}
