These are the stories of the rescue workers and civilians who raced to Ground Zero to rescue the buried. Immediately after the collapse, rescue workers are convinced that they will find survivors in the ruins – and, miraculously, a handful are found. As the last survivors are pulled from the rubble, the rescuers shift focus to the monumental task to identify and recover the lost among the ruins. After the Towers Fell is the first in-depth look at the aftermath of the Towers' collapse and the heroes who selflessly took on the monumental task of rescue and recovery of their fellow New Yorkers","popularity":0.2945,"poster_path":"/gY0FjlLCNrV7qm9qAMGzOhqwyBC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Towers Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/11: After The Towers Fell","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"9/11: After the Towers Fell","type":"纪录片"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Discovery.Channel.911.After.the.Towers.Fell","type":"纪录片"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":972622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry MacDonald","original_name":"Terry MacDonald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"5b0d723bc3a368427600ad87","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellen Harder","original_name":"Ellen Harder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d6f240e0a2608d300ad29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erin Arbaugh","original_name":"Erin Arbaugh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d6f44c3a3684279008f29","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053205,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristen Akers Gozdecki","original_name":"Kristen Akers Gozdecki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d6f690e0a2608e100ba7b","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053205,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristen Akers Gozdecki","original_name":"Kristen Akers Gozdecki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d6f85c3a368427600abdc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellen Harder","original_name":"Ellen Harder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d6f94c3a3684268011791","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115163,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Winston","original_name":"Joe Winston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d706f9251417bc900838a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141740,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Lahey","original_name":"Michael Lahey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d715e9251417c2f00978c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966167,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seneca Lester","original_name":"Seneca Lester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d71f79251417bcc0092c1","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053216,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Marie Flores","original_name":"Ann Marie Flores","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d721c0e0a2608db00beaf","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418291,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Len Miller","original_name":"Len Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d724f9251417c1700b920","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135745,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matthew Stratton","original_name":"Matthew Stratton","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d72880e0a2608e500bd40","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246707,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Towers","original_name":"Jonathan Towers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0d7349c3a368428400a916","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2053226,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Eyres","original_name":"Alan Eyres","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/zRCXIGLP1bGee3oLbeM4C0wnlxD.jpg","credit_id":"5b0d7377c3a368426d00ec9c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053227,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erica M.
