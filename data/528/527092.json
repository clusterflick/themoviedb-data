Given privileged access to both galleries the film documents this landmark exhibition, whilst interweaving Rembrandt’s life story, with behind-the-scenes preparations at these world famous institutions. Exploring many of the exhibition’s key works, through contributions from specially invited guests including curators and leading art historians, this EXHIBITION ON SCREEN favourite makes a welcome return to the big screen marking the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt's death. For many, Rembrandt is the greatest artist that ever lived and this deeply moving film seeks to explore the truth about the man behind the legend.","popularity":0.6324,"poster_path":"/xxNMlFJqDDCLMgEtbaJLIwLjdid.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Alliance Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rembrandt: From the National Gallery, London and Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: Rembrandt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"EOS: Rembrandt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lindsay","original_name":"Robert Lindsay","popularity":0.8048,"profile_path":"/7BRYggQuwUVfs3ncuVTcw7QgaDw.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61765c475294e7002a3f7faf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3283548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Mansoor","original_name":"Kate Mansoor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765b3566a7c3008d6c8845","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531573,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kate Reid","original_name":"Kate Reid","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765bc20d5d85002af06a45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2969127,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robin Fox","original_name":"Robin Fox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765baff85958006431c258","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765b548ddc340044b9c8c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3283548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Mansoor","original_name":"Kate Mansoor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765b64172d7f00673bc068","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260433,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack O'Halloran","original_name":"Jack O'Halloran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765b81f85958008e54f511","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2311990,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikky French","original_name":"Nikky French","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765bd9894ed6004205999d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423240,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adama Lavis","original_name":"Adama Lavis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765c030d5d85002af06aa7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765b48172d7f002efd8e69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282507,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clive Mattock","original_name":"Clive Mattock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61765bf3fd7aa40043622a96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6449472","wikidata_id":"Q63092329","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3LgGghhjKA4E2HDjbh3pEGSLeUT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":754,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xxNMlFJqDDCLMgEtbaJLIwLjdid.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":508},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z8OgGck12W1dVDGOnsUm6H1RhVj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"EXHIBITION ON SCREEN | Rembrandt | Trailer","key":"PoG17N8uoNk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2016-12-01T17:01:49.000Z","id":"617659d15294e70044f5ec37"}]}}}
