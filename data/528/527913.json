It is based on a short story written by Justin Spooner. The film seeks to convey the power of sound to store and evoke memory. It both recounts and reimagines aspects of his grandmother’s life. The film is told from the vantage point of her granddaughter, voiced by Olwen Fouéré. Where is Eva Hipsey? mixes fact and fiction to search for a truth or representation of Eva’s reality, past and present. It combines experimental animation techniques with archival material taken from both Spooner and Mc Hardy’s grandmothers’ collections; family photographs, vérité camerawork, sketchbooks and field recordings, to suggest a journey. Driven by curiosity and a desire to listen deeply, Eva explores and attempts to capture the world around her, stepping further and further from the familiar.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/hryDR1CbJLGig7m2Rljy6TAxSxa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where is Eva Hipsey?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olwen Fouéré","original_name":"Olwen Fouéré","popularity":0.3003,"profile_path":"/jvBLYkqqEdZGGcg4YVUZhBl6or4.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"6001ec17aa659e003c933a86","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orla Mc Hardy","original_name":"Orla Mc Hardy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b12c324c3a36862b1008998","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937734,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maeve Mc Hardy","original_name":"Maeve Mc Hardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001eb6b6aa8e0003e789c90","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2937735,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John McHardy","original_name":"John McHardy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001eb7590cf51003c519d2d","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937736,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cliona Harmey","original_name":"Cliona Harmey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001eb8fcb3084003ed9b948","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937737,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Moré","original_name":"David Moré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ebb190cf51003e531b41","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937738,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Val Barry","original_name":"Val Barry","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ebbc7d5db5003dce60cf","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937739,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alice Lyons","original_name":"Alice Lyons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ebc4c0348b003e35b28b","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937729,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Justin Spooner","original_name":"Justin Spooner","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ebf5cb3084003cd944f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937729,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Justin Spooner","original_name":"Justin Spooner","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ebff7390c0003cf955d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937730,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicky Gogan","original_name":"Nicky Gogan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ec351c635b004feef440","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937731,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Allison Zigadlo","original_name":"Allison Zigadlo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ec67d40d4c003c54feba","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937743,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Moaz Elleman","original_name":"Moaz Elleman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ec89223e20003eb4ad6a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Micah H.
