She was born into the restaurant business but didnâ€™t follow her calling right away. She moved to San Francisco, came out as a gay woman, and eventually left behind a safe corporate job to pursue her passion of opening a hotel in the sleepy vacation town of Guerneville, two hours north of the city. A restaurant, a market, and a bar soon followed, and the town began its transformation into a thriving destination. Along the way, she weathered a flood that severely damaged her hotel, saw her marriage fall apart, and faced local resistance. A final project pushes her to the brink and changes her perspective on life, love and empire.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":"/mK0kypP3Qtjjz84NIG7JK2cD1Li.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire on Main Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3921376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crista Luedtke","original_name":"Crista Luedtke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qjpkRIQvMiytIgHP5NIuwcylciY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677168a7005810c23f928ddc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018386,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jessica Congdon","original_name":"Jessica Congdon","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b11e7419251417b4d004e9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7653086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sNxbaNkrUAG5EZJ2mf4GY9TD8pf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cPY25mP6hCNeMLEtK0IZ96fYBwC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mK0kypP3Qtjjz84NIG7JK2cD1Li.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinequest Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
