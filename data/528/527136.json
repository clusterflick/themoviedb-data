The music video was inspired by the film \"Tudo Sobre Minha Mãe\" (1999), by Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar. It is different from the traditional format, as it presents a long narrative, in which the music appears more as a complement to the story told in the video. It was shot on 16mm cameras and became a short film.","popularity":0.357,"poster_path":"/9C6yBO021E0LGOqLr6hSFH6LikT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92048,"logo_path":"/bEHvtPu7mCoSPbbvGC1czOcITqt.png","name":"Spray
