A satire of the Venetian merchant class, embodied by narrow-minded, complaining and intolerant men whose mistrust of the fairer sex borders on the absurd, The Boors perfectly illustrates Goldoni’s theatre, a “theatre of life with a real content, characters observed in reality, and a natural expression.” Thus, a theatre in which the man Voltaire described as “nature’s son and painter” scrutinises his contemporaries, their relationships and their social behaviour. His work served to entertain while providing posterity with an acute testimony of the morals of his time. Indeed, Jean-Louis Benoit warns against reducing the author to a simple “photographer of reality”.","popularity":0.1704,"poster_path":"/7tzYEiN3nHQ8q9kvorvVQZYzDm1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petit Théâtre de Naples","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les rustres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Giroudon","original_name":"Gérard Giroudon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xk7Oo01kF19w6yU7WYBPOm4HADD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Canciato","credit_id":"5b1296cf92514166fd0032a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Raffaelli","original_name":"Bruno Raffaelli","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/1yMD6BTvxSk0CjZ4jUr3SZMEkJQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"5b1296e6c3a36862920062de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Céline Samie","original_name":"Céline Samie","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/OEQ54Z1MtZ8CzSt6lR2y5knn6X.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"5b129737925141670d0048e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":268997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coraly Zahonero","original_name":"Coraly Zahonero","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/tVG40jcvqlFVGInEBgKZAUVvqiV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Margarita","credit_id":"5b1296ac0e0a263ddc004734","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clotilde de Bayser","original_name":"Clotilde de Bayser","popularity":0.2086,"profile_path":"/b6rxLD8i3bPjyC6H6qYsBkc0Dh7.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Felice","credit_id":"5b13a2bb0e0a263dd700d624","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Natrella","original_name":"Laurent Natrella","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/yNL3GnPLEHNeoDs5okPKxiFu67s.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"le comte Riccardo","credit_id":"5b13a2df92514166e500be49","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Hecq","original_name":"Christian Hecq","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":"/tWQB5qzKdSjlrWrizmC20RRqpE3.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Lunardo","credit_id":"5b12971f0e0a263dbb004b1e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Marder","original_name":"Rebecca Marder","popularity":0.2382,"profile_path":"/nVjmGILgh0CLMMmMaphCOnTZ34X.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lucetta","credit_id":"5b1297069251416712003bac","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Lormeau","original_name":"Nicolas Lormeau","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/1rhLbMUbElLITJw9Yth0TqIQ29X.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Maurizio","credit_id":"5b1f6e529251413f2e00056a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Montenez","original_name":"Christophe Montenez","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/zmeyQ1BBgzOOJNPaEnmtmQh9a98.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Filippetto","credit_id":"5b1f6e630e0a267dfb00051e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":263085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Louis Benoît","original_name":"Jean-Louis Benoît","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b13a232c3a368629c010a4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057352,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlo Goldini","original_name":"Carlo Goldini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b14f183c3a368533000909b","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4VeDPVkU1d76IVIj0jfb14ftqXj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tzYEiN3nHQ8q9kvorvVQZYzDm1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aT4DMFGQkhRVpF1zZRLHIMcm92h.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 2","release_date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
