The average adult spends the majority of their waking hours in front of some sort of screen or device. We're enthralled, we're addicted to these machines. How did we get here? Who benefits? What are the cumulative impacts on people, society and the environment? What may come next if this culture is left unchecked, to its end trajectory, and is that what we want? Stare Into The Lights My Pretties investigates these questions with an urge to return to the real physical world, to form a critical view of technological escalation driven by rapacious and pervasive corporate interest. Covering themes of addiction, privacy, surveillance, information manipulation, behavior modification and social control, the film lays the foundations as to why we may feel like we're sleeprunning into some dystopian nightmare with the machines at the helm. Because we are, if we don't seriously avert our eyes to stop this culture from destroying what is left of the real world.","popularity":0.123,"poster_path":"/t1iyUonKSBKyub7sfX4sLXCcfYQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary about the world of screens we are immersed in.
