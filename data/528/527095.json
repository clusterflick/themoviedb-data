In the exhibition on which this film is based - VAN GOGH & JAPAN at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam - one can see why.  Though Vincent van Gogh never visited Japan it is the country that had the most profound influence on him and his art. One cannot understand Van Gogh without understanding how Japanese art arrived in Paris in the middle of the 19th century and the profound impact it had on artists like Monet, Degas and, above all, Van Gogh.  The film travels not only to France and the Netherlands but also to Japan to further explore the remarkable heritage that so affected Van Gogh and made him the artist we know of today.","popularity":0.8174,"poster_path":"/5jrIrv9ejwVDs0x2L0CqO1PZC1F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The untold story on Van Gogh's art.","title":"Van Gogh & Japan","video":true,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: Van Gogh & Japan","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"EOS: Van Gogh & Japan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent van Gogh","original_name":"Vincent van Gogh","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/5J4Mqg55zJybRYOyKrRrY4JDCwP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"638c000d8a84d20096519c53","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bickerstaff","original_name":"David Bickerstaff","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce022f89251412d00b9cf51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9298918","wikidata_id":"Q63639178","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/boIXLRYXPRImx4amBENcQWsFHWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dDrptAgyqnJIsfecwn2tfx9GCFU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5jrIrv9ejwVDs0x2L0CqO1PZC1F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/z8FPzyDlECcg9lieQ5Fwgc7Gjie.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236810,"name":"paintings"},{"id":242080,"name":"vincent van gogh"},{"id":303652,"name":"japanese art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sky Arts","release_date":"2021-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"COURTESAN | Van Gogh & Japan (2019) | Film Clip","key":"RDPllg1yzts","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2019-04-29T08:00:02.000Z","id":"632c3c3eecbde9007e15d03a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL TRAILER | Van Gogh & Japan (2019)","key":"boPI6c-IXG4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-02-26T12:35:34.000Z","id":"5ca1db2a92514129a70416dd"}]}}}
