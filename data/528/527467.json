Through the lens of first generation black vintners, The Colour of Wine looks at the history of South Africa wine-making and how we are still working to eradicate the ignoble rot of apartheid from our vineyards. The personal stories of four winemakers are blended with interviews of wine experts from around the world to tell the bigger story of a passionate group who are bringing about transformation in the industry, one glass at a time. This is the fifth film for renowned director Omotoso, whose works include God is African, Man on Ground and Vaya, all of which have premiered and won awards at festivals around the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of Wine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zX2zYH3HyoKE3V17Mt2qxSrtaJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/79BpS5cJ88D1vJRyekt1aSdgkSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6GG0FpfWw67uVIwFCAYsBX5Mn66.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxfFHgxZ4SJLnYBNpYwxBZ86ICq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney South African Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Bioscope, Maboneng","release_date":"2018-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Encounters ","release_date":"2018-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Colour of Wine Documentary Promo directed by Akin Omotoso","key":"gcubsGqBDTY","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-09T13:44:59.000Z","id":"5caf0b870e0a2626cac22593"}]}}}
