In a decade, cancer cases in children have increased threefold and malformations in newborn babies have gone up 400 percent. Why? Because they are the children of farmers, working in tobacco plants, in a country that allowed the commercialization of transgenic seeds and the use of huge quantities of the herbicide glyphosate. Women and men are fighting for their rights and their life. Farmers, parents, doctors, scientists, lawyers. They cry, they shout, they hope, they suffer. They are met with silence. And the reality: their children are doomed.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/iZbqWATc3XCT2mHVfa6e6KoGNLt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114256,"logo_path":"/bhI0fc46fMVEp2cDzXgv03JjUws.png","name":"Spicee","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genetically Modified Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8326336","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZbqWATc3XCT2mHVfa6e6KoGNLt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
