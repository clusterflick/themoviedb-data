Tracing the scattered clues of England’s post-industrial northern coastline, with coal mining seams extending deep under the seabed, lead to stories embedded in the surreal landscape and the vivid re-enacting of the death of a young coal miner Billy, by his workmate. The story inspired the New York based percussion group So Percussion, who together with Amber created the film’s cathartic music.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38052,"logo_path":"/8uZNsz3zVarlswxx3CDBtfLPgMT.png","name":"Amber Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song For Billy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen","original_name":"Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b12c1fbc3a368629800469a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
