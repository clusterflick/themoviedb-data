Simon Keenlyside’s riveting performance as the tortured Prince of Denmark in Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser’s starkly brooding production had critics raving that Keenlyside’s superb singing, coupled with his deftly delineated three-dimensional Hamlet, was one of the greatest examples of operatic drama of our time. The cast includes Marlis Petersen as the long suffering Ophélie, who brilliantly shows why her mad scene is so justly famous, along with Jennifer Larmore and James Morris as Gertrude and Claudius.","popularity":0.4122,"poster_path":"/mL0TBeYvKNxnZnc3mL11m2N1GHJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thomas: Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":496070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Keenlyside","original_name":"Simon Keenlyside","popularity":0.2641,"profile_path":"/vHgkO88a6x0iqDOpLesACBvuUiw.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hamlet","credit_id":"5b11d8709251417b0f0032be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlis Petersen","original_name":"Marlis Petersen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/juOFmeaDnu7el7F0UqtlkdNQ8ac.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Ophélie","credit_id":"5b11d8870e0a265850003ac3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Larmore","original_name":"Jennifer Larmore","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/ApUQIPKWQiQMi9jbc6zxbndJJTC.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Gertrude","credit_id":"5b11d8cc0e0a265856003c52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Spence","original_name":"Toby Spence","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/vXYj1RlprfHh5MupHcNJ8rANYbS.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Laerte","credit_id":"5b11d8e19251417b0400373d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":432628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morris","original_name":"James Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1YYYRhX4X1Z8MrRgBa88dpLTm9X.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Claudius","credit_id":"5b11d8f4c3a3687b17004543","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1660048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bernstein","original_name":"Richard Bernstein","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/sdHL9hknGjmpLPzEtAuD9UEC4AE.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Gravedigger","credit_id":"5b11d9089251417b59003f17","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Bonner","original_name":"Liam Bonner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Horatio","credit_id":"5b11d92dc3a3687b260038dc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Mikhailov","original_name":"Maxim Mikhailov","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Polonius","credit_id":"5b11d9360e0a26584c003f51","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1611666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pittsinger","original_name":"David Pittsinger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Ghost","credit_id":"5b11d944c3a3687b0b002b8a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Plenk","original_name":"Matthew Plenk","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Marcellus","credit_id":"5b11d9550e0a26584a0039df","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Richards","original_name":"Peter Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Player King","credit_id":"5b11d97a9251417b4d0041ec","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1681175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Rozakis","original_name":"Christian Rozakis","popularity":0.1617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Player Villain","credit_id":"5b11d98a0e0a265853003f1c","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Schowalter","original_name":"Mark Schowalter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Gravedigger","credit_id":"5b11d9989251417b0f00337f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Wynter","original_name":"Joshua Wynter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Player Queen","credit_id":"5b11d9a8c3a3687b200042bb","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":269139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Fleming","original_name":"Renée Fleming","popularity":0.3384,"profile_path":"/7L6CEpZS2eYmKZquDTFTSpEbTiz.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Self -
