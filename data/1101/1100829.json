Upon his arrival, Gamble learns from Angela, the president's daughter, that her father has been imprisoned by Cortez, the leader of the revolutionaries. Gamble also is imprisoned but frees all the prisoners as well as himself by impersonating the prison comandante. After forming an army, Gamble delivers the message--a large money draft sufficient to pay the army and secure President Losada's government--and is rewarded with Angela's love.","popularity":0.2495,"poster_path":"/fZIPNbSYUtVmF65VlRKaVLvAinC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Garson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heads Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"De Cabe√ßa Erguida","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice 'Lefty' Flynn","original_name":"Maurice 'Lefty' Flynn","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/n156oXZhoxpx8suqWJzBwCdTWFD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Breckenridge Gamble","credit_id":"64124d0969c70f00f670e883","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Myers","original_name":"Kathleen Myers","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/niIoKVEM8mPNWcnamLU3m7qZerW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"64124d172667780099a193f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry McCoy","original_name":"Harry McCoy","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/pjJnpVjuW5fe7VsAw126XnOz9Nj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Biff","credit_id":"64124d53a6c104009aff5d79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalla Pasha","original_name":"Kalla Pasha","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/492Zo6nCd4fzmRNWoHsjzHG7Ff8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Malofich","credit_id":"64124d25a6c10400790694f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Turner","original_name":"Ray Turner","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/iRbVa2TVkh1a5tiYvxI82a6iOLR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Zeke","credit_id":"64124d9ffe6c1800daef275a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Perry","original_name":"Jean Perry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cortez","credit_id":"64124d3326677800ec696bdc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Ross","original_name":"Milton Ross","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Losada","credit_id":"64124d41323eba00a2a89615","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3964311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Rogers","original_name":"Hazel Rogers","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Anita","credit_id":"64124d64fe6c18009c6884e5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1562382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Ripley","original_name":"Ray Ripley","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Comandante","credit_id":"64124d73a6c10400d8d868d8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cauterio","original_name":"Robert Cauterio","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Spy","credit_id":"64124d84ede1b0287fdb84e9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1023464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Barringer","original_name":"Barry Barringer","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64124cbea6c10400f762efdf","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Wagner","original_name":"Rob Wagner","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64124cf9ede1b0285b665567","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Garson","original_name":"Harry Garson","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64124caee18e3f0816c509d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0134707","wikidata_id":"Q83295825","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fZIPNbSYUtVmF65VlRKaVLvAinC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
