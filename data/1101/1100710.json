With the easy comes the insane. With the laid-back trails comes the steep and deep backcountry. And with the most extraordinary snow season ever comes THUNDERSTRUCK 7. Known world-over for their chute-bashing antics, Team Thunderstruck conquers the Rocky Mountains with a proclivity toward insanity. Watch Randy Swenson, Brad Story, Dan Davidoff, Trennis Baer and many more take their horsepower, skill, and courage to the limits of snowmobiling. Watch Randy Swenson’s awe-inspiring 2500 foot-of-vertical “Super Chute”, Brad Story’s amazing crack at the “Eye of the Needle” and Wes Little and Lyle Sinden’s adrenaline-driven carnage-fest that leaves both sleds in a pile at the bottom of the hill. From shoulder-deep powder to the thrilling chute-climbing the riders are known for, Thunderstruck 7 will have you screaming to ride!","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/97a4pbRAi5o5FGhSOLQxqfzCHX5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thunderstruck 7","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Swenson","original_name":"Randy Swenson","popularity":0.1112,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6411ff9c6a3448007ba674ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3963844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Story","original_name":"Brad Story","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6411ffadfe6c180084e90851","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3963846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Davidoff","original_name":"Dan Davidoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6411ffbbfe6c180084e9085b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trennis Baer","original_name":"Trennis Baer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6411ffc4a6c10400c0c633c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3963848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Little","original_name":"Wes Little","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6411ffe6e18e3f07ac535594","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3963850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyle Sinden","original_name":"Lyle Sinden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6411ffeeb42242007d726074","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Phelan","original_name":"Jim Phelan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6411ff606a3448007ba674e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/97a4pbRAi5o5FGhSOLQxqfzCHX5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
