Prilly is only really interested in getting a car and a house. She isn’t in love with Emon, but does enjoy his sense of humor. One day Emon catches his father with Prilly. His father begs Emon not to tell his mother. As time passes, it seems that Emon cannot get Prilly out of his mind. In the meantime, Emon’s discovery of her love affair with his father has woken Prilly up to the error of her ways, and she begins praying regularly and even apologizes to Emon. Emon then realizes that Prilly really wants to be with him. Happy ending.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/mU838JQotKm7uVhJvb7tyWfuVrV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catatan Si Emon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ade Faisal","original_name":"Ade Faisal","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Emon","credit_id":"64ededd1c3c89100c6848331","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nurul Arifin","original_name":"Nurul Arifin","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/oRbC91U8OA1vmJOdL2QiP0lMVjw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Prilly","credit_id":"64edee5406f984010c712ae8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2986416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aom Kusman","original_name":"Aom Kusman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ayah Emon/Oom Eddy","credit_id":"64edeec41feac100fe5eaf00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ade Irawan","original_name":"Ade Irawan","popularity":0.1945,"profile_path":"/tzOqLq6zh6x1unQcm4YFc26JShe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ibu Emon","credit_id":"64edeeff06f98400ca57502b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nasri Cheppy","original_name":"Nasri Cheppy","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edef964cbe1200c449fea3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307946,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jiwat K.
