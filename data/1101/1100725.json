W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\", \"I Am Not a Racist\" rearranges the scenes of the classic movie and recreates its dialogues to criticize the racism in it and also in the world today.  Freemenville is a little city somewhere in the USA. A city ashamed because of its past of slavery, but proud of being the first in the country to end it. There is an annual ball to celebrate this fact. And this year's ball may be the biggest ever, because of the possible presence of a big celebrity, who is coming to town to see the premiere of a play.  However, the play happens to be D. W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\", a racist work that starts a series of events exposing the racism that still exists in the city, culminating in the recreation of the KKK.","popularity":1.4434,"poster_path":"/xqYxhb6u35JzCa47AAC3k37kQXA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A parody of D.
