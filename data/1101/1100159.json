A place where our lead Grace, a volunteer hands out the shower, food and clothing tokens whilst constantly mesmerized by a waxed orange presenter on the communal TV scolding a Â£250,000 tattered house, unoccupied. When one loyal member, Nate an ex-teacher is gifted this grand night's stay he is painfully turned away by a very unhelpful receptionist because of incorrect personal information. Grace unexpectedly comes across him and in a rash but brave panic calls on her boyfriend to take him into their nearby flat, but it might be too late as the cold encapsulates his body and becomes his worst enemy.  In support of Shelter, West London Mission, Ark Resettlement Services & The Vineyard.","popularity":0.2547,"poster_path":"/dBJsYbUEqclyqoo3eWMewAtaF8b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Track","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3010824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augusta Woods","original_name":"Augusta Woods","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"6410be4bc390c5007f17cdf3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":197126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wil Johnson","original_name":"Wil Johnson","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/iKe3GXTQvq0zBVh5YwJxfEk17cR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nate","credit_id":"6410be5f176a9400f3c2f233","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4246724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ceara Coveney","original_name":"Ceara Coveney","popularity":0.9398,"profile_path":"/1zWEshFJ5dSRK37DlfJlQuZEcoO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"64fb4ea6f8595800e2afb210","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1253198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louisa Connolly-Burnham","original_name":"Louisa Connolly-Burnham","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/h7b1rhJruEKNlmgQ5xLU4xNKqYf.jpg","credit_id":"6410be70e18e3f07d05554fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3010824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augusta Woods","original_name":"Augusta Woods","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410be85c390c500796f90e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2500359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat White","original_name":"Cat White","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/kUPeAESU9EViPVoAlujiqJDfFss.jpg","credit_id":"67293716cef8b9b5f55a3c23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2955271,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James New","original_name":"James Newberry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fa5e6ed679e53f87afaa2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14168670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dBJsYbUEqclyqoo3eWMewAtaF8b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1130}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
