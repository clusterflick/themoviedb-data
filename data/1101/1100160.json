She heads to the big city, where she lands a job playing piano at a posh nightclub. In this capacity she catches the eye of a British colonel, who finds her work in a Parisian cabaret, where she becomes a great sensation. Rather than reward herself with the fruits of her labors, Iza sends every penny of her salary back to her village priest, who distributes the money among the poor parishioners. Ten years after being forced from her home, the now-glamorous Iza makes a return visit, magnanimously encouraging her former sweetheart to marry a girl better suited to him. It should be no surprise that leading lady Sari Fedak wrote the script for Iza Neni herself.","popularity":0.1459,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Iza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Sekely","original_name":"Steve Sekely","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/3XyeDAcxDwHTvKPP5tngvymXVY.jpg","credit_id":"6410bf82176a9400f3c2f287","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50083,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"István Békeffy","original_name":"István Békeffy","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410bfbba6c104009afecda4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361433,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"István Mihály","original_name":"István Mihály","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410c02cc390c500f6fff1b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686530,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Marcel Vertès","original_name":"Marcel Vertès","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410c0b2323eba010b91eedf","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025319","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
