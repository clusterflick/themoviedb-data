When her father dies, her older brother Faisal (Rano Karno) asks her to move to Jakarta with their younger sister Fitri (Paramitha Rusady). Faisal, who is going to college, while running a small business, experiences the betrayal of being swindled by his business partner. Anisah then takes action to help support the family financially by producing and selling snacks through a group of street people with the help of Adam (Deddy Mizwar), a musician who lives in their neighborhood, who has come to admire Anisah’s spirit.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sGSBv7w2SfMMHyu6DfgJ3u0l7ps.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuberikan Segalanya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGSBv7w2SfMMHyu6DfgJ3u0l7ps.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
