In this essayistic film, starting with his personal life story (his father was shot as an enemy of the state, he himself was a highly respected student and artist in the Soviet Union) and the history of the Kyrgyz people (bearers of a vibrant and distinctive culture destroyed by socialism), he eventually arrives at big questions about the goal of human progress and the fate of humanity in the 21st century. \"What will life be like for people in the 21st century?\" he asks, not least in view of looming ecological catastrophes, and answers: That is the sole responsibility of humanity. Long difficult to find, the film has now been uploaded to YouTube in a restored 4K version by Kyrgyzfilm.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/pSJ141Y09hFc0r5cl1lqBxxrdYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88367,"logo_path":"/8BGGqyuaxijzhqzmrgdCINWbPhj.png","name":"Tsentrnauchfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":40456,"logo_path":"/7aU4xI1sq3ZGXbNsX6uP0Z6VYlU.png","name":"Kirghizfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chinghiz Aitmatov reflects on the problems and concerns of people on Earth.","title":"Aylanpa – World in a Vortex","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Aylanpa – Mir na krugakh svoikh","type":"Transliteration of the original Russian/Kyrgyz title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Aylanpa – The World in its Orbits","type":"alternative English translation"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ajlanpa – Welt im Strudel","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ajlanpa – Die Welt auf ihren Bahnen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189061,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chinghiz Aitmatov","original_name":"Chinghiz Aitmatov","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":"/cWVYQNJNBaYGA52NDwdfzBmuhwI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6411a5d5ede1b028e84d7944","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2402584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Konstantin Orozaliev","original_name":"Константин Орозалиев","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6411a4eda6c10400d8d83bb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189061,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chinghiz Aitmatov","original_name":"Chinghiz Aitmatov","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":"/cWVYQNJNBaYGA52NDwdfzBmuhwI.jpg","credit_id":"6411a5c3b4224200f7917908","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2402584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Konstantin Orozaliev","original_name":"Константин Орозалиев","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6411a541b4224200d8667735","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3160562,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valerij Vilenskij","original_name":"Валерий Виленский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6411a4cfb42242008a2f2020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3160562,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valerij Vilenskij","original_name":"Валерий Виленский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6411a532323eba010b925814","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480657,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shandor Kallosh","original_name":"Шандор Каллош","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/dFkcV1Q1b33sxWioejoXEjuS9GL.jpg","credit_id":"6411a577b4224200826f2f13","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":844,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/pSJ141Y09hFc0r5cl1lqBxxrdYO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":563},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/jXPkbV0pAXav92du8vPGY8gVpZl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1989-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Д/ф \"Айланпа - Мир на кругах своих\" (1989) [4K] реж.
