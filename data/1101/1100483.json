Ghadeer, a young journalist who took refuge in Brussels after the Islamic State took the city, decides to abandon the promise of a future in Europe to return to his people. With a few friends, he founded Radio One FM, a station independent of any religious, community or political affiliation, which could help restore peace. The first two years were those of utopia for this volunteer team: thanks to journalistic work documenting the country's difficulties, Radio One gained a national audience. But economic difficulties and the growing pressure of militias linked to the political clans fighting for control of Iraq finally got the better of the enterprise.","popularity":0.056,"poster_path":"/gmXVnQupDBjkyhEtXd4PSMhfZDY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94662,"logo_path":"/m8431npr3t3JFaRZFxUOaE9HKVF.png","name":"Indyca","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":185630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arpa Films","origin_country":""},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":89897,"logo_path":"/v3rlDYOuNvmwXkUV0O1tIIdbadZ.png","name":"YUZU Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dans les ruines de Mossoul - Don’t Come Back","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matteo Delbò","original_name":"Matteo Delbò","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64119dd7ede1b028635d1816","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Avesani","original_name":"Chiara Avesani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64119dcce18e3f07d055b194","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27209515","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bbh01scVeXGSuW1sBMaz3iGvkC3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gmXVnQupDBjkyhEtXd4PSMhfZDY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
