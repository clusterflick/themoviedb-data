His wife, Feby (Nia Zulkarnain), chooses to separate from him and leave behind their daughter, Seruni (Asteria Dania Mangi). The scenes depicting the daily routines of Aria and Seruni are particularly reminiscent of the American film. Against this backdrop, Thiara (Yasni Aziz Wahab), who wants to become a singer, emerges and become very close to Aria. Feby, who is now very successful in her own career, demands that Seruni be returned to her, particularly because she has become aware of Sriaâ€™s relationship with Thiara.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lagu untuk Seruni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
