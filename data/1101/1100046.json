You're A Vampire","overview":"Twin sisters Lara (Eilis Cahill) and Helen (Devon Bailey) Baxter couldn't be more different. Lara is a black-haired goth who has a shrine to Anne Rice in her candle-lit room and enjoys solitary walks in the cemetery while blonde Helen is in the church choir and is one of the most popular girls at school. They live with their religious mother (Jo Jo Hristova) and older brother Raymond (Michael Strelow), who is studying to be a doctor. One day, Helen suddenly dies after losing a lot of blood due to a nosebleed. After examining her blood, Raymond concludes that she was suffering from a rare blood disorder, one that isn't listed in any medical book. Later that night, a bloodied Helen comes back, saying she drank the blood of the morticians...yup, sis is now a vampire. The family decides to protect her, which also means they must feed her, no matter what the cost.","popularity":0.1643,"poster_path":"/44RXA2Ou1psNRhCLMsSUdU8RsO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173409,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Sugar Factory","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oops!
