Beginning with stark footage from the Kwang-ju people's massive uprising and brutal suppression in 1980, through a recent strike of militant office workers, protests by farmers against the import of U.S. dairy products, and a showdown at the border of the two separated Koreas, these tapes seethe with ardent rage and moral intensity. As the struggles have escalated the use of video as a weapon, a record and a defense has grown to be an integral part of the Minjoong Movement, the people's movement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Korea: Until Daybreak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hye Jung Park","original_name":"Hye Jung Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a55129869e750068d0d1a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hye Jung Park","original_name":"Hye Jung Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a55136ed28b90091f49ace","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
