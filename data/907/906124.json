His friendship, his profession and his daily life for more than 25 years.\r Its theme, not because it is specific, is less universal. Motherhood, work and men intersect with dance, rehearsals, and self-management. The everyday and humor so color the artistic production that they end up defining a way of doing that exceeds the personal to become collective.\r Because it is more full of dance than words, because it is very agile, because it is emotional and funny at the same time, \"Consejos para seguir bailando\" can be defined as a contemporary dance comedy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Consejos para seguir bailando","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Basterretche","original_name":"Martín Basterretche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a4cb4b869e750045fe0ca4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14169220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
