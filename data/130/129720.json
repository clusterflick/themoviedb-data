At the request of his mother Marianne, he is now returning to Kaisertal to give his father Johann a hand. After an expensive renovation of his stud, the stud ran into financial difficulties and the farm was threatened with loss, because Mayor Ludwig Hackl asked for his loan back earlier than agreed. Johann is up to his neck, but he doesn't want to be helped. To this day, he has not forgiven his son for turning his back on the common veterinary practice. Hansi tries to support the father anyway, but the malicious Hackl lets him down coldly: He wants to finish off his former best friend Johann - because of an old feud.","popularity":0.4307,"poster_path":"/zTcah6i9865DIX5F3S2vOcFSRKa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19506,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berge 7 Filmproduktions
