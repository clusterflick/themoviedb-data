This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated in shellfish and fish in the Yatsushiro Sea which, when eaten by the local populace, gave rise to Minamata disease. The disease was responsible for the deaths and disabling of thousands of residents, all around the Yatsushiro Sea. The marine ecosystem was also extensively damaged.","popularity":0.1813,"poster_path":"/kSTNbOnKmbn3ZZtfzQBcLYgBZwK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seirinsha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shiranui Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Minamata, Part II: The Shiranui Sea","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Shiranuikai","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soichi Ito","original_name":"Soichi Ito","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"660e09469c97bd0149a38a93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noriaki Tsuchimoto","original_name":"土本典昭","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/kcr6g8u1kHHwVx8fT3g5cA2SGWh.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self - Interviewer (uncredited)","credit_id":"660e096aa885870162e6eba6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2080609,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Keiko Ichihara","original_name":"Keiko Ichihara","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6220e3a741aac40044e97037","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryutaro Takagi","original_name":"Ryutaro Takagi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6220e3436f43ec006d55e8ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noriaki Tsuchimoto","original_name":"土本典昭","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/kcr6g8u1kHHwVx8fT3g5cA2SGWh.jpg","credit_id":"6220e3af902012006d48820c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noriaki Tsuchimoto","original_name":"土本典昭","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/kcr6g8u1kHHwVx8fT3g5cA2SGWh.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3ac3a368484e17e31d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737318,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masafumi Ichinose","original_name":"Masafumi Ichinose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62850f56e004a600a193add7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4633026,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toru Okagaki","original_name":"Toru Okagaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660e0a799dee58017d0980e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550542,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teizō Matsumura","original_name":"松村禎三","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660e08f8c8a5ac017c7bba0e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kouichi Asanuma","original_name":"Kouichi Asanuma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660e08d85aadc4017c6706ff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4633022,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takayuki Oguri","original_name":"Takayuki Oguri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660e0923da9ef2017d58a8d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462266,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Koshiro Otsu","original_name":"Koshiro Otsu","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc2c66d0e0a26105afa57c4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0374217","wikidata_id":"Q17028323","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kSTNbOnKmbn3ZZtfzQBcLYgBZwK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":837},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/crG2zsOcjmbgFpNl7RNxtIV6iMZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"},{"id":14673,"name":"disease"},{"id":14988,"name":"east asian lead"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tokyo International Film Festival","release_date":"2008-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
