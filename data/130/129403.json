A scarecrow blows down, clouds move by quickly. Beings take shape; a town appears, animals flee, and a horse gallops by. A child looks on. Monsters run and float by: the phantasmagoric is everywhere. A woman's figure tumbles through space. A clash ensues. The horse falls. Goblins take control. The night and its denizens are relentless. Forms appear and become grotesque. Will dawn and calm ever come?","popularity":0.0886,"poster_path":"/gfjxYmghE0dgkPjSRa5s8i35xuW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1933-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Night on Bald Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":48,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Parker","original_name":"Claire Parker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/bLM7Z8PpU5jTGpVeqiyNQCHixKs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3cc3a368484e17e7bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Alexeieff","original_name":"Alexandre Alexeieff","popularity":0.164,"profile_path":"/1OaC3iacH4gyg5uvbVR4gOIm3Qu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3cc3a368484e17e7b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0024721","wikidata_id":"Q3549662","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p5E6ZKqpMCWQYRQoOtIxG97ptzW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7yCiM4Bpq8bT0b7ujA7bqQtmCg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fK121dvs0pTPs6a2gFtK26krxqv.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8BWa2pSBGuJ0BbgNaKRYL0tgbSl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gfjxYmghE0dgkPjSRa5s8i35xuW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"1933-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
