In one of the first films to use computer animation, director Peter Foldès depicts one man’s descent into greed and gluttony.  Combining traditional and computer animation (one of the first to use it!), Peter Foldes, through clever metamorphosing images and powerful line drawings, provides a moralistic tale of one man’s enormous appetite and selfish consumerism.  Growing more corpulent and repulsive, his indigestion leads to a nightmare where he is consumed in a hell of emaciated bodies.  By extension, this film indicts affluent nations and individuals in a world where many starve.","popularity":0.643,"poster_path":"/9McTS3W9k5CaAj0CzPXNrOz0oRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1974-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunger","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":30,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"La faim","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Foldès","original_name":"Peter Foldès","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zXXfjLyM9r81U20pNmJep6PNIO2.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c89b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3416599,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nestor Burtnyk","original_name":"Nestor Burtnyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200ed6d47c9fb0043f1ab2a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"CG Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3416600,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Marceli Wein","original_name":"Marceli Wein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200ed76e8d0b400de5e2250","department":"Visual Effects","job":"CG Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Jodoin","original_name":"René Jodoin","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/SuKxrgwtBpuylSlh7OonOzZkDB.jpg","credit_id":"6200ed9a4b9bae00dd3fed60","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166703,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Florent Brault","original_name":"Pierre F.
