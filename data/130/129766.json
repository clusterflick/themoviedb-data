The windowless room has a single entrance and no mirrors. Two women, Inès Serrano (Viveca Lindfors) and Estelle Rigault (Rita Gam), are then led in; afterwards, the Valet leaves and locks the door. Realising that they are in hell, the trio expects to be tortured; however, no torturer is forthcoming. While waiting, they strike up a conversation and discuss each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.  Adaptation of the play by Jean-Paul Sartre.","popularity":0.4996,"poster_path":"/z9kw9QXoNP7LhrFdy5nQCWBEVry.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aries Cinematográfica
