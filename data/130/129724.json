Then life intervened, with marriage and children putting an end to her racing days. Now, after a 34-year break, Rosie is making a comeback. Urged on by her daughter and self-proclaimed manager, she tries to find sponsors. The road is uneven and behind her dreams of a comeback, there are depressions, burnout and family tragedies. This film is a revealing and complex portrait of a woman who gains strength by allowing herself to be weak. The fight to become the world's fastest grandmother is really the fight to reclaim one's own life.","popularity":0.2103,"poster_path":"/oICGxzQ7k9yfoGzUxfyujmVnfxl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mantaray Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2011-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mother’s Comeback","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Millberg","original_name":"Sabine Millberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose-Marie Millberg","original_name":"Rose-Marie Millberg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Millberg Lantz","original_name":"Peter Millberg Lantz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807a9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Ekman","original_name":"Åsa Ekman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aGvmqi3d21lxCfy5Vzz3ILe0O0n.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":555772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominika Daubenbüchel","original_name":"Dominika Daubenbüchel","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stina Gardell","original_name":"Stina Gardell","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/p0tRsQTGVF4s7Bspl54g50E8nbB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563329,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anders Teigen","original_name":"Anders Teigen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e1807bb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Ekman","original_name":"Åsa Ekman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aGvmqi3d21lxCfy5Vzz3ILe0O0n.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e18079d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1964899","wikidata_id":"Q14955251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2k1poSerZD9TGAXTEdi1JTkPnbe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1480}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/oICGxzQ7k9yfoGzUxfyujmVnfxl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":845,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/2yJ2y2p2zbcCMBdPfv6LVSFMnns.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":180175,"name":"cerebral palsy"},{"id":194988,"name":"drag racing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
