Following a brace of songs recorded live at San Francisco's Fillmore Theatre, this selection settles into a tried and tested promo formula for half of its running time, using ghetto-real grainy footage of the moody trio stalking inner city streets. \"When the Ship goes Down\" branches out into conceptual territory with a three-minute epic concerning internecine gang warfare that breaks up the band's performance. On \"Dr Greenthumb\" they play on their Furry Freak Brothers of rap stereotype in the setting of a green-fingered General Hospital. \"(Rock) Superstar\" sees a Cypress fan winning a Willy Wonka-style ride through their Hall of Mirrors, where he is transformed into a bona fide, gold lame-wearing rock star. Set in a derelict warehouse, the hardcore romp of \"Can't Get the Best of Me\" is reminiscent of Fight Club's basement brawls.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/vB9r0J6OENzgMRqNyFyGkGa2k7M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cypress Hill - Still Smokin'","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0471137","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":861,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vB9r0J6OENzgMRqNyFyGkGa2k7M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":898,"name":"hip-hop"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
