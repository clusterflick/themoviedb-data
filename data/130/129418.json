Sean saw a news report on a \"Bigfoot Hunter\" (Carl Drybeck) who claimed to possess the body of a dead Sasquatch. He believes Drybeck is a phony and decides to create a new show that reveals people's paranormal claims as hoaxes. Sean assembles his old film crew and heads to Northern California's \"Lost Coast\" to meet with and interview Drybeck. Obsessed, Sean is staking his comeback, his life and the lives of his documentary film crew on proving Drybeck's claim to be a hoax.","popularity":0.461,"poster_path":"/esIg4M7lhgxtstGVPMvBXhctM1Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10505,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Breed
