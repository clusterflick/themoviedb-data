After a lifetime chasing utopias, gave his last bout, worthy of death, with the same revolutionary fervor with which he faced the Franco regime and Central American dictatorships. This is the story of a man who spent fourteen years in Franco's jails, was sentenced to death, tortured and risked his life repeatedly by his dreams of universal social justice. Coherent, lucid and sarcastic to the last breath, Miguel organized and controlled every detail of your life away.","popularity":0.0506,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Final Escape","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcos Ana","original_name":"Marcos Ana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c69d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Cardenal","original_name":"Ernesto Cardenal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Garrigosa","original_name":"Diana Garrigosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agustín Ibarrola","original_name":"Agustín Ibarrola","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pasqual Maragall","original_name":"Pasqual Maragall","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evo Morales","original_name":"Evo Morales","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/5Se2YjkwVyxICDc9RFMBn2CRNZX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6b1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Núñez","original_name":"Miguel Núñez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6b5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastià Piera","original_name":"Sebastià Piera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6b9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eulàlia Vintró","original_name":"Eulàlia Vintró","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c6bd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Solé","original_name":"Albert Solé","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a368484e17c699","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1757660","wikidata_id":"Q11904702","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer AL FINAL DE LA ESCAPADA.mov","key":"jnMdgXfVJ2A","published_at":"2010-10-18T09:44:04.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6eec3a3685448009174"}]}}}
