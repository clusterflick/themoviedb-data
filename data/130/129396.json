Noel, 17, serious, weighed down by responsibility; Paudie: 11, cocky, not so bright and dreams of playing in goals for Liverpool and Scwally: 7, naive and obsessed with Star Wars (despite never actually having seen the films). Using a battered bread van, the brothers embark on a journey across the wild Irish landscape on the Halloween weekend, grinding gears and screaming at each other to get to an arcade machine in Ballybunion. Along the way they are detoured by escalating brotherly battles in an off-beat and moving journey that can only lead them home.","popularity":0.2896,"poster_path":"/eh7z2kCqVxljEPgKdlRAfA7fWek.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timmy Creed","original_name":"Timmy Creed","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Noel","credit_id":"52fe4b3bc3a368484e17e67d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Courtney","original_name":"Paul Courtney","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Paudie","credit_id":"52fe4b3bc3a368484e17e681","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tj Griffin","original_name":"Tj Griffin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Scwally","credit_id":"52fe4b3bc3a368484e17e685","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Wycherley","original_name":"Don Wycherley","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/tW4s04DGwi7MEXQ6bIxdIYmI0ah.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"52fe4b3bc3a368484e17e689","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":962560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Lucey","original_name":"Martin Lucey","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/6gjx9uo8X7RD1DkqH1YidF2XO2z.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"67d044b3434c98c8ec812fe0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Fraser","original_name":"Paul Fraser","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b3bc3a368484e17e673","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Will Collins","original_name":"Will Collins","popularity":0.2067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b3bc3a368484e17e679","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1608782","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eh7z2kCqVxljEPgKdlRAfA7fWek.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
