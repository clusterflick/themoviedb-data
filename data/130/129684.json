Floating through a pastoral yet mazelike setting of raw wooden debris cobbled together into a benign shantytown, six longhaired women in flowing white nightgowns “milk” their locks and the goats they live with to generate cheese. Shots of animals crowded in pens and the sisters’ bunk bed– cluttered room visually compare the women to their ruminant allies. As nurturing caretakers, these women represent maternal aspects of Mother Nature. Here Rottenberg investigates feminine magic, the ability to “grow things out of the body” as she says, as the ultimate, wondrous physical mystery.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/dvsCZw96byWMYHVJiOMFqjCdcv0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheese","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Rottenberg","original_name":"Mika Rottenberg","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b43c3a368484e1801a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1784384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dvsCZw96byWMYHVJiOMFqjCdcv0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
