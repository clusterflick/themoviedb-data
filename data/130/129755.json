Howard was doing all kinds of \"butt-bongoing\" at the time and the title skit on the video is a send-up of Hispanic dance shows, with your host \"Howard Estern.\" The video also features Jessica Hahn in the 3-D skit \"Jungle Man\", \"Guess Who's the Jew\" with Kurt Waldheim, Jr. and KKK-guy Daniel Carver, see Capt. Janks go on a date with John DeBella's wife (which Howard predicted would happen in his battle with DeBella in Philadelphia), the \"Gross Video Contest\" winners, Boy-Gary dressed as an ape and eating his baby doody, the classic \"Tribute to Vagina,\" and you get to tag along on a real, live, lesbian dial-a-date. Many consider this to be Howard's best video of all. Exact sales figures were never released, but the best guess-timates were that \"Butt Bongo Fiesta\" sold about 300,000 copies with virtually no advertising except for Howard pushing it on the show.","popularity":0.3245,"poster_path":"/bxYerz4RHcfGaAKrJDsTDRLQpvG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howard Stern's Butt Bongo Fiesta","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Stern","original_name":"Howard Stern","popularity":0.2785,"profile_path":"/3ahyCVSafwRP284o0Gwme5VOTQm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e180abd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":176012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Quivers","original_name":"Robin Quivers","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/eHrrBg1Tbjh8uD8hoRb498LeNDg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e180ac1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Martling","original_name":"Jackie Martling","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/mrwxV5uVlppptMY9Ju4qGOI1G7j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b45c3a368484e180ac5","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0137006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bxYerz4RHcfGaAKrJDsTDRLQpvG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
