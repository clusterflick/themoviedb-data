Filmed in Mauritania, it follows the day-to-day activities of women, documenting their work, family and community life, expectations and emotions. Women of the Sand was filmed in cinema-verité style, with no narration. The non-intrusive camera allows the women to tell their stories in a candid and intimate way. The stunning photography captures the immensity of the desert and the giant sand dunes which have already covered ninety per cent of the country and threatening the very existence of the nomadic lifestyle. Women of the Sand is a tale of women’s resilience and a poignant portrait of a vanishing way of life. The film is part of the permanent film collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), New York.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/4AHdQZoncg0JkaMWUmMsV20sJQt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lobodocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women of the Sand: Nomad Islamic Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Wolf","original_name":"Richard Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e45c1d1feac1011b2b03bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"C.
