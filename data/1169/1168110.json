The audio-visual as well as the auto-mobile machine traverse and transcend the valley from Boden to Bschlabs. The film was made during a residency at the Tyrolean Bschlabertal and reflects the topology of an abandoned place as well as the conditions of its own creation. A darkroom was built in the old elementary school, film strips were hung to dry in the classrooms and then projected in a self-built cinema in an old shed. The images were filmed on print material with a Bolex camera, they are thus raw and multilayered like the valley, created by manual labor as it is still the basis of everyday existence in the Bschlabertal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4MavbSEbfsOBqbaUUZlJWuIjZya.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earth Water Motor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2759300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markus Maicher","original_name":"Markus Maicher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e41001c613ce014df9e2dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4098826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cosma Grosser","original_name":"Cosma Grosser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e41022594c9400ffe3f398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4MavbSEbfsOBqbaUUZlJWuIjZya.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
