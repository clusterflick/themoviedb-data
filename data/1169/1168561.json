Her foundation is being laid on the imagined land that claims to be the birthplace of my grandmother's God. In the mythology that she passed down to me during many summer nights, her God was magical, kind, imaginative and democratic, just like my India was supposed to be. But today, through its many retellings and reimaginings, the tale is being used as a political tool to manifest the violent desire of a Hindutva state. This film attempts to remember, as well as dream, a forgotten nation.","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amma ki katha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nehal Vyas","original_name":"Nehal Vyas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e5cc27c613ce00c9f0b824","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34700801","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
