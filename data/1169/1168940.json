Miyata is devoted to conspiracy theories and he tries to get Sano to believe this idea. But Sano doesn't believe it, and they fight. As Miyata's phone keeps ringing all day, Sano loses patience and takes the call. It was a phone call from Miyata's father, who was saying unintelligible things, probably from dementia. Sano hangs up the phone in confusion and tries to go home with Miyata.","popularity":0.1395,"poster_path":"/ely69ZzHUyYijZDanAlzKuR6JPx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two of Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Suigyo no majiwari","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Two of Us","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2803251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroki Sano","original_name":"Hiroki Sano","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/eudfuToqIA5Ei4HHyrO91n5ktli.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64e8c61406f984014e685c40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshinori Miyata","original_name":"Yoshinori Miyata","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/dqkLQQdGz0DfOUCBNJfxP28pH4K.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64e8c62ae894a6011ef8297c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igarashi Kohei","original_name":"Igarashi Kohei","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/1fnvTLSkqgFn2TWnK6hEKT2Hxuk.jpg","credit_id":"64e72d1890ea4b011e787b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ely69ZzHUyYijZDanAlzKuR6JPx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
