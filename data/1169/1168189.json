Just as the title implies, this state of the art DVD takes you to 20 of the most spine tingling, gut wrenching, jaw dropping roller coasters in America. Theme parks across the country are locked in a battle to build the tallest, fastest, most disorienting roller coasters, and the results are the most thrilling rides ever devised.  In years past a roller coaster meant riding a wooden coaster in a two across car with lap bar restraints. Today it can mean any number of variations on the thrill ride theme, from stand up coasters, to floorless coasters, to inverted track looping coasters… and don’t forget the huge mega coasters that are redefining the boundaries of human endurance! They’re all here… twenty of the best America has to offer, the newest, biggest, baddest coasters in the land, plus some perennial favorites like Coney Island Cyclone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eCQeNHr8qX7MsRpWqeDgmbCLZk9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldhill Home Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Ultimate Scream Machine","title":"America’s Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills The Ultimate Scream Machines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2937,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eCQeNHr8qX7MsRpWqeDgmbCLZk9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1989}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
