His son Lo Yung (Lau Hark-suen), however, indulges in debauchery. Entrapped by the Japanese, chicken-hearted Yung leaks information about the guerrilla that leads to deaths and injuries in the group. Yeung-guo reprimands his son for being an invisible traitor, inflicting even more harm than an outright traitor. Placing righteousness before family, he decides to execute his own son. As a writer-director-actor in the film, Hou Yao proclaimed his unwavering stance on resistance on the screen, and delivered a scathing attack on the cowardly ‘invisible traitors‘ at that time. Not long after, Hou was sadly arrested and executed by the Japanese army in Singapore.","popularity":0.3347,"poster_path":"/g5GeF8i1hWMM8qQ0RkdsnLX0ZIn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wenhua Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1938-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fortress of Flesh and Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Great Wall of Blood and Flesh","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fortress of flesh and blood","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hou Yao","original_name":"Hou Yao","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64e4359cc3c89101007ad298","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Wan-Seung Chan","original_name":"Nancy Wan-Seung Chan","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/5hrLDEatLQS4PEfICVJqYreWyHL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64e435ae1feac1011b2af0c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3031062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junchao Jiang","original_name":"Junchao Jiang","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/bF7herT0N8kqTlO4aQ7nFXgEwVr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64e435c1c613ce00c9eff69a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3442350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Sau-nin","original_name":"Wong Sau-nin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64e4362a06f984012d707b18","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Cho-San","original_name":"黃楚山","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64e436801feac1011b2af142","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lau Hak-Suen","original_name":"Lau Hak-Suen","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/oF9aJ8cA0FUKnZ6d8tSZ9Lj5scS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6644e6b0b85d8f4aa6584b2a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hou Yao","original_name":"Hou Yao","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e4358a06f984012d707ac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228093,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yeung Yam-Ming","original_name":"Yeung Yam-Ming","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e45334511d0900e353f9ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3404332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6pRyHl4lquVICPIxmbGK3yn81Wg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g5GeF8i1hWMM8qQ0RkdsnLX0ZIn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":10535,"name":"second sino-japanese war (1937-45)"},{"id":155294,"name":"family conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1938-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
