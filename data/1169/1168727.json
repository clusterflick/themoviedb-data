Explores the complexities of the conflict through archival footage and portraits of political leaders who lived these events and played an important role in the search for a peaceful resolution to the seemingly interminable Irish “troubles”.","popularity":0.5595,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War and Peace in Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerry Adams","original_name":"Gerry Adams","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e6391906f98400ae47e4bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ervine","original_name":"David Ervine","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e6397ec613ce014dfaf973","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4230358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Reynolds","original_name":"Albert Reynolds","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e63993770700013beeaf36","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2046745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur MacCaig","original_name":"Arthur MacCaig","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e63795c3c891013ab0d130","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhy6OgaD4RemesnbZ8axdbvNXOx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1776}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":230977,"name":"the troubles (north ireland, 1966-98)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Rio Cinema, London - British premiere","release_date":"1998-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
