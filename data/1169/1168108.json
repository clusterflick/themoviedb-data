Despite facing deplorable working conditions and the pervasive dual discrimination of race and gender, these women served their country with unbreakable determination and pride. Led by the formidable Major Charity Adams, they not only achieved their mission in half the expected time but also broke barriers, standing firm against inequality and inspiring future generations. Tragically overlooked for years, the story of the 6888th sheds light on a remarkable, untold chapter of American history, reflecting both the triumphs and injustices that shaped the nation's path towards civil rights. Their courage and resilience continue to resonate, a poignant reminder of the societal strides still needed to fully recognize and honor their invaluable contribution.","popularity":0.4091,"poster_path":"/v1cEOCJcJZOGKwPLHBuXoayLTJo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""},{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the throes of World War II, the courageous women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion battled against racial and gender discrimination to sort and deliver a backlog of mail, forging an overlooked chapter in the fight for civil rights.","title":"Black Women and World War II: The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4227740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Jackson Kelley","original_name":"Patricia Jackson Kelley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Patricia Jackson Kelley","credit_id":"64e40e11511d0900e353d776","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298796,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Getz","original_name":"Trevor Getz","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Trevor Getz","credit_id":"64e40e1dc613ce00ac3f9cdf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665321,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gina Gelphman","original_name":"Gina Gelphman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e40e2d06f984010c6d9ac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665321,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gina Gelphman","original_name":"Gina Gelphman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e40e39c3c89101007abd5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
