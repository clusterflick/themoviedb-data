He finds solace in a rural farmhouse he rents from a Professor of Psychology who lives next door with a student he mentors on her dreams. Over two days, the dreams of all three impact their daily discourse in unexpected ways unhinging their lives through a vortex of a greater reality. BLUE FIRE spins the controversial A.I. phenomena beyond the consensus narrative of destroying the world VS. saving the world towards a radical vision of the future.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/gsAUoqsgSNjclv72nWe5vtLfh6Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125522,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertical Pool","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A CYBER-FI FEVER DREAM","title":"Blue Fire","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e690c9c3c89100e35f5142","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e690a25258ae00add3a17d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e690b31feac10138d94059","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e690d8c613ce010b8bc7fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28315339","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsAUoqsgSNjclv72nWe5vtLfh6Q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cl3TXgNVEWRRamzydPGHX2355ZR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
