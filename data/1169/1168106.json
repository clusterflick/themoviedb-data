The film approaches the Rohingya crisis from the personal point of view of the victims. Gang rape survivors talk directly to the camera with unprecedented candor. Building upon a heartening thought from Albert Camus, the documentary follows a dramatic arc from hell to redemption, with stories of survival and endurance.  Harrowing yet uplifting, THE ANTECHAMBER OF HELL is both a searing testimony of crimes against humanity and an enlivening testament to the human spirit.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lobodocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Violence, Sexual Assault, Crimes Against Women, Refugees, Myanmar, Recently Added Thought-Provoking Docs","title":"The Antechamber of Hell: The World's Largest Refugee Camp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Wolf","original_name":"Richard Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e40d9406f984014e66610e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
