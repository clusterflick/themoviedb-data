At work, Carlos has never spoken to Olivia, but he sometimes spies on her without her realising. Night after night, they sleepwalk aimlessly until meeting one another. They gradually come to know one another in this mystical landscape. By day, they are once again total strangers, who don't know or speak to one another, each one in their cubicle. Will they wake up, or will they continue to dream like the trees around them?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What the Trees Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4229784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfonso de Angoitia","original_name":"Alfonso de Angoitia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e5d0cde894a600e4e524ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
