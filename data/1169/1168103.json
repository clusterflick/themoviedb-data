Amidst this backdrop, the film unfolds the story of Baptiste Garnier, a half Oglala Sioux, half French-Canadian scout known as \"Little Bat.\"  Torn between his Sioux roots and his U.S. allegiances, he navigated the brutal Indian wars and was at the heart of pivotal battles, including the tragic Wounded Knee massacre. Although perceived as a bridge between two worlds, Baptiste's duality often led him to make heartbreaking decisions. By the time of his untimely death in 1900, shot by a white bartender over a bar tab dispute, he epitomized the complex weave of identity and legacy, raising questions about the cost of serving two peoples in a divided America.","popularity":0.4542,"poster_path":"/flxXQeAApq3JqC3lUz5d6GzWB80.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""},{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Torn between his Sioux heritage and duty to the U.S. Army, Baptiste \"Little Bat\" Garnier navigates the brutal Indian wars.
