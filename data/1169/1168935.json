Hudson is an enigmatic figure, full of paradoxes: he was an Argentine gaucho who became an English writer. He fought in the army against the “savages” but also defended them. He wrote obsessively about his native land, but never returned. In the twists and turns of the road, emerges a mix of documentary speculation, personal memory… and dreams.","popularity":0.2314,"poster_path":"/3Ga2uA0BvXXCiYLwIMyDbdMobaY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46212,"logo_path":"/8NNQcHc8dx2uYW3ehi5ebHmJZOe.png","name":"Gema Films","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":110999,"logo_path":"/vpAUVwDAgE65s4ZhKMzZ5dS3rhX.png","name":"Errante Producciones","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mixtape La Pampa","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Di Tella","original_name":"Andrés Di Tella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/roLKzSYB2kmZIUJOqdA3Ny2S5QH.jpg","credit_id":"64e72a5e594c9400ffe56c51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darío Schvarzstein","original_name":"Darío Schvarzstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ae16b87aec00abd32a4a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931701,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeria Racioppi","original_name":"Valeria Racioppi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ae1f091e6200c4bb4db2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393605,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roberto Espinoza","original_name":"Roberto Espinoza","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ae2d955c6500aa5b2f99","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411584,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"José Manuel Gatica","original_name":"José Manuel Gatica","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ae32955c650138bc0d78","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725357,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gema Juárez Allen","original_name":"Gema Juárez Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ae3cec4552012c19d37c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006236,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clarisa Oliveri","original_name":"Clarisa Oliveri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ae42ec455200ea4d6708","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Di Tella","original_name":"Andrés Di Tella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/roLKzSYB2kmZIUJOqdA3Ny2S5QH.jpg","credit_id":"6539ae8a091e6200c4bb4e46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28865157","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1660,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3Ga2uA0BvXXCiYLwIMyDbdMobaY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1164},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":856,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/8g9MDFVJXSKp5BTnjo8gs0sWoat.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iUh56vHbCZXXcAr3MohUoGJBhut.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
