The Philadelphia Phillies — a last-to-first success story — with their long hair, beards, and blue-collar work ethic — a softball team in pinstripes.  This was a World Series that won't soon be forgotten. A six-game slugfest that sent pitchers scurrying to the showers. The heroes were named Dykstra, Molitor, Schilling and Alomar. The games were unforgettable. The sheer drama of Game Four — with its runs, hits, and duration — all records. The surgical precision of Curt Schilling's shutout in Game Five. And Joe Carter's incredible three-run blast to win Game Six — just the second time in history a home run has ended a World Series.","popularity":0.4404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 1993 World Series: Toronto Blue Jays vs Philadelphia Phillies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Len Cariou","original_name":"Len Cariou","popularity":0.766,"profile_path":"/9VJeCcxHkPkN4xH4izmwYHXRMy2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64e6d7d95258ae00c94b6608","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Molitor","original_name":"Paul Molitor","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e6d9065258ae00add3cef3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4231213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Alomar","original_name":"Roberto Alomar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e6db1190ea4b011e785ae2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curt Schilling","original_name":"Curt Schilling","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e6db2390ea4b00aef9fb5d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3503279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devon White","original_name":"Devon White","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sbyAb62kt1qrp3vtxUrYvgfSJXk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e6db57c613ce00ac40d7e8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roy Epstein","original_name":"Roy Epstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e6d91de894a600c727b7b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830411,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Scott","original_name":"Jeff Scott","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e6d945594c940139c7c6e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651433,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heather Mitchell","original_name":"Heather Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e6d986594c9400ffe547f3","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee Insler","original_name":"Lee Insler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e6d99c5258ae00c94b66ea","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4eT7fMcftqdfOO3WnRcvjgegMNJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2080}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":189924,"name":"world series"},{"id":267788,"name":"major league baseball (mlb)"},{"id":293465,"name":"toronto blue jays"},{"id":322047,"name":"philadelphia phillies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
