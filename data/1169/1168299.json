Guardian of the memory of the history of fishermen settling in the bay of Arrifana beach. He takes us through his personal and family experience to the current Portinho da Arrifana and the fishing community where his son Giló and his grandson Eugénio continue to practice the ancestral arts of artisanal fishing to earn their daily bread. The daily hustle and bustle of the boats and the unloading of fish for the local auction coexists with the whistle of the surfers' monitors in the coming and going of the sea waves that they share in common, while a little bell in the distance on the beach announces the arrival of the Berlin balls to the delight of summer bathers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Inverno é Muito Longo e o Verão Pode Não Dar Para Tudo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vera Abreu","original_name":"Vera Abreu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e4b5cee894a600ae7287d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
