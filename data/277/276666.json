Daunant was haunted by these creatures. His obsession was first visualized when he wrote the autobiographical script for Albert Lamorisse’s award-winning 1953 film White Mane. In this short the beauty of the horses is captured with a variety of film techniques and by Jacques Lasry’s beautiful electronic score.","popularity":0.5598,"poster_path":"/arQhhHwKoAkHxueZokFpcXu2f5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sinpri","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream of the Wild Horses","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25162,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Prévert","original_name":"Jacques Prévert","popularity":0.2306,"profile_path":"/fo8jsfHUigLrCnIVAkeGpjD75oz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"626971904ccc50004ff95afb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629698,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy Pérol","original_name":"Guy Pérol","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a274074507d00c577daf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mohamed Iguerbouchène","original_name":"Mohamed Iguerbouchène","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/jKMAtjtTjGlqddXgV0oxbbdanRr.jpg","credit_id":"651a275a93bd6900c4df92ba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denys Colomb de Daunant","original_name":"Denys Colomb de Daunant","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/c4WZDdAMMLKLC4HQtV1kqkTMbHE.jpg","credit_id":"651a2769c50ad200ad811088","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322677,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André Costey","original_name":"André Costey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a277374507d011c0dbc54","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Lamorisse","original_name":"Albert Lamorisse","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/krhOEQjEneF7O8Hom719LBMN7em.jpg","credit_id":"651a2710967cc73427f16615","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385857,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Guillemot","original_name":"Claude Guillemot","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a2783ea84c700aeea495e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1722367,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Lasry","original_name":"Jacques Lasry","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a291fd861af00ae31dba4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denys Colomb de Daunant","original_name":"Denys Colomb de Daunant","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/c4WZDdAMMLKLC4HQtV1kqkTMbHE.jpg","credit_id":"539c25a30e0a267a41002289","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0064260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vwFOGqmU40HcICR1OYODdjox48p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/arQhhHwKoAkHxueZokFpcXu2f5H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"tw","file_path":"/eyAZOZioTzZcVL9l5dK3Qne7K5a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":941,"name":"tradition"},{"id":158266,"name":"wild horse"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":323418,"name":"camargue"},{"id":323419,"name":"south of france"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
