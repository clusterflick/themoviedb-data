It was carried out by visionary 1960s neuroscientist John Lilly, who had a remarkable ambition; to communicate with dolphins by teaching them to speak English. The experiment was seized upon by NASA, who were embarking on the first serious search for extra-terrestrial intelligence beyond the Earth. When they detected a signal from ET, they would need to understand how to communicate with a species other than humans. Here, without leaving the planet, was the opportunity to practice such inter-species communication. But what started with â€˜60s idealism would spiral into the darkness of the decade, and end in tragedy, with rumours and scandal about drug abuse and a sexual relationship between Peter and Margaret. Fifty years on, this film tells the real story of just what happened at the Dolphin House.","popularity":0.6583,"poster_path":"/u4H1KpzIPCGBydFfMMy4CprHVSn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Talked to Dolphins","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Bridges","original_name":"Jeff Bridges","popularity":2.025,"profile_path":"/xms1RAY6q7Lzp7wNeRCB0kzhucn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58c3f69b925141342b003532","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2952257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Drake","original_name":"Frank Drake","popularity":0.1917,"profile_path":"/vTNXD3VmNELfKBVn5GRzIlOJrW7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Astronomer","credit_id":"600f5515cb8028003f06ee3a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Riley","original_name":"Christopher Riley","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3f754c3a3681a4a003895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3822614","wikidata_id":"Q17326542","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2661,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u4H1KpzIPCGBydFfMMy4CprHVSn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1774}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
