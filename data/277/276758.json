Meant to be a sequel to Don Owen's acclaimed 1964 film \"Nobody Waved Good-bye\", \"Unfinished Business\" looks at life two decades later for Peter and Julie's (Peter Kastner and Julie Biggs) daughter Isabelle \"Izzy\" Marks (Isabelle Mejias).  Curious, funny and intelligent, 17 year old Izzy feels the frustrations of her limiting environment and the pull of a more exciting, larger world.  She meets passionate anarchist wannabe Jessie 'Fixit' (Peter Spence) and is quickly drawn into his free living alternative lifestyle.  Much to the displeasure of her once free-thinking parents and friends.","popularity":0.8867,"poster_path":"/vFPNlR4LFtsWfYrGoRyrOSK3esw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zebra
