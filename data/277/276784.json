A true cultural phenomenon, Up with People performed in 47 languages to a global audience that included popes and kings; they even performed at the Super Bowl half-time show. As former members offer heartfelt reflections on their time with Up with People and what the group really mean to them personally, the viewer is presented with a thought-provoking glimpse into the cultural underbelly of politics, cults, and money.","popularity":0.4437,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":93900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storey Vision Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smile Til It Hurts: The Up With People Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3221908,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Kimbrough","original_name":"John Kimbrough","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6133018115376c0098fbb146","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee Storey","original_name":"Lee Storey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599944ee9251411e1e026417","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873057,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ezra Bookstein","original_name":"Ezra Bookstein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599944ff9251411e1e02642d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":962392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Penelope Falk","original_name":"Penelope Falk","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5999450c925141260102457d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Lechner","original_name":"Jack Lechner","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59994520c3a36822680245d9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bari Pearlman","original_name":"Bari Pearlman","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59994518c3a3680eed01c948","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873056,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee Storey","original_name":"Lee Storey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599944e592514125c2024716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1329440","wikidata_id":"Q15847649","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5976,"name":"multiculturalism"},{"id":165643,"name":"song and dance"},{"id":284620,"name":"racial equality"},{"id":311527,"name":"non-profit organization"},{"id":340294,"name":"up with people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Slamdance Film Festival","release_date":"2009-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SMILE 'TIL IT HURTS Trailer","key":"v5lkKQUp81Y","published_at":"2009-07-25T15:14:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59cd6ae6c3a368310f0001a5"}]}}}
