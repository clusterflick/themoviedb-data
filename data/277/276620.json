Forty-odd \"Skipjacks\" were still used by Maryland watermen to dredge up oysters from the Bay. At that time, the fleet had survived because of a Maryland conservation law which prohibits the use of motor power for oyster dredging. The watermen traditionally marked the opening of each oystering season with a skipjack race which the Maryland State Tourist Board incorporated into its annual \"Chesapeake Bay Appreciation Day.\"","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watermen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1135813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Fisher","original_name":"Holly Fisher","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/AjmBUj9GQm8qUW3NVw1ccmQe6Ir.jpg","credit_id":"539b674bc3a3684afc00189d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
