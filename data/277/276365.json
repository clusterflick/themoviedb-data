In this two-part program, members of Ailey's dance company celebrate his memory by performing three works choreographed by Ailey himself, as well as a special ballet tribute choreographed by Ulysses Dove. Each piece is introduced by Judith Jamison, the dancer and choreographer whose career was nurtured to stardom by Ailey, and who was, at the time of this production, Artistic Director of the company. The Alvin Ailey Dance Theater is uniquely eclectic in range, repertory, and style. As a choreographer, Ailey explored the black experience and went beyond, finding universal human truths in all his work.","popularity":0.2379,"poster_path":"/4riOwVELZnpzESdHnC62k8ww7Dk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tribute to Alvin Ailey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1226872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Jamison","original_name":"Judith Jamison","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/6g5mITQzdzfTgZoKi6YQTEQDBQv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5ebed12915a4a1001c9ec51a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Ailey","original_name":"Alvin Ailey","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/AcEI7GpGzg7nido9fdK3oE1MSAf.jpg","credit_id":"62ff5155bbe1dd007f19a59b","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639871,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ulysses Dove","original_name":"Ulysses Dove","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebecd339979d2001f2abf4c","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Grimm","original_name":"Thomas Grimm","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/bR8eLg6xuBKbgxlvhQqDczjc4M8.jpg","credit_id":"5ebecd8dbc8abc0023c31567","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Grimm","original_name":"Thomas Grimm","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/bR8eLg6xuBKbgxlvhQqDczjc4M8.jpg","credit_id":"5ebecd7a3d3557001cdeeeb6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4riOwVELZnpzESdHnC62k8ww7Dk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":515}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":247727,"name":"dance theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
