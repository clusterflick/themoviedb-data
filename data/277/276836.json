Loukia is a teenager currently staying at her cousin’s house in Athens. Unlike her cousin she is timid and quite stressed for the school exam. She studies history. Between the lines of her book the historical events sprung up in a multidimensional way. Liappa transverses the dimensions of the real the imaginary and the symbolic. She invites the viewer to consider the construction of the filmic as well as the historical text. She succeeds in making a film with an open end and to leave room for our own contingent constructions.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":"/o3c2r3vYuZkcuslOVWp5sUIbDMU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1980-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Refused","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Απεταξάμην","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Apetaxamin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1642909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maritina
