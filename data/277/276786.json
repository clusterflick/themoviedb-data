Men only are interviewed by the two filmmakers in a witty montage of free-wheeling encounters. Pornographers, corporate executives, a funeral parlor director and Santa Claus are among those who reveal more than they intended. A surprisingly candid view of men's feelings towards women 15 years after the birth of the women's movement.","popularity":0.2289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rate It X","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1311752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Winer","original_name":"Lucy Winer","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself / Interviewer","credit_id":"5b9da07c925141260000906b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2128766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudette Charbonneau","original_name":"Claudette Charbonneau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9da052c3a368441200993b","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula de Koenigsberg","original_name":"Paula de Koenigsberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9da02cc3a368440600a08e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1311752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Winer","original_name":"Lucy Winer","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9da04492514125e40092df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0141769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
