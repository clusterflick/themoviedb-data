And if she doesn't tell the story of a lifetime, someone else will be writing her obituary. She is kidnapped by Paige, a failed novelist with an ax to grind. Jeremy is a video store clerk whose one talent is fooling himself, and others, that he's an artist. He and a pop junkie of a detective named Lydecker are hunting for Ellen.

Will Ellen write a brilliant novel or end up a tragic movie-of-the-week?","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Am I in a Box?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Grubb","original_name":"Rachel Grubb","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/eilLFACUbrDSSeYqHI7i6gVh8d7.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ellen Farnsby","credit_id":"539ead39c3a36872570014b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Dirlam","original_name":"Derek Dirlam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jeremy","credit_id":"539ead50c3a36872570014b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brooke Lemke","original_name":"Brooke Lemke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paige","credit_id":"539ead5dc3a36872650013c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Rylander","original_name":"Mike Rylander","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pqanYpGohZEJ9GIIwxYNOHiVsOO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ted Murray","credit_id":"539ead6fc3a36872570014bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Feeney","original_name":"Matthew Feeney","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/cz3Gh75ZtbG0hOjOMWiAvA1afit.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Detective Lydecker","credit_id":"539ead90c3a368723100148e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3931595,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christina H.
