Young. The documentary peeks in on an urban farm run by local kids; an uphill struggle to save a portion of the waterfront; the infamous arrival of an IKEA store; and more. The film was an official selection at the 2008 San Francisco International Documentary Film Festival.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":"/kBtB0NNJ48cqrSqbkXSQmJBYvAs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hole in a Fence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Uyeda","original_name":"Ben Uyeda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58cc26df9251415e69016722","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sharps","original_name":"David Sharps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58cc26eac3a3682889013bee","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
