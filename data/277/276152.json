A few years ago I was creatively adrift, looking to do something in film but unhappy with what I'd tried so far.  Then I happened upon Werner Herzog's comment that aspiring filmmakers shouldn't bother going to film school. Instead, he said, they should make a journey alone, on foot, for five thousand kilometers, \"let's say from Madrid to Kiev\". This journey, he claimed, would teach one the essential nature of cinema.  I decided to take Herzog's words literally and walk from Madrid to Kiev. MORE SHOES is the resultant filmed record of that journey. It's the story of who I met, what I saw, and how the whole experience changed me.  The film premiered at Slamdance 2008 and went on to play 25 festivals worldwide, winning \"Best Documentary\" honors at three of them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kazimir","original_name":"Lee Kazimir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53998b060e0a263e41001c56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1152272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
