At the age of 21, Italian composer Giacchino Rossini penned the masterful comic opera “L’Italiana in Algeri” (“The Italian Girl in Algiers”) in less than a month. The composer’s youthful exuberance comes across in this infectious 1987 performance. Though she’s known mainly for her Wagner roles, acclaimed German mezzo-soprano Doris Soffel shines in the title role of Isabella. Ralf Weikert conducts, and Mauro Pagano oversees sets and costumes.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/7DXzwpRSwS1V5VTm352m6l0rQ9N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1987-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":149,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L’Italiana in Algeri","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"L'Italiana in Algeri (1987) Schwetzinger Festspiele","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Soffel ","original_name":"Doris Soffel ","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/yvGULEzL5FYrCmxAeiDjFrL0n5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Isabella","credit_id":"5470b63f9251414f54001c11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gambill","original_name":"Robert Gambill","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/4ulOUs5UHqJdn2kbUTtmTcFdyT5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lindoro","credit_id":"5470b64ec3a3682f9a005704","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter von Kannen","original_name":"Günter von Kannen","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mustafà","credit_id":"5470b65bc3a3680e220004e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enric Serra","original_name":"Enric Serra","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Taddeo","credit_id":"5470b66b92514112e7005633","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuccia Focile","original_name":"Nuccia Focile","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/9eco6ATvCOsx1W7Vbs1F6jSoeCi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elvira","credit_id":"5470b676c3a3682fad004db0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Maclean","original_name":"Susan Maclean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Zulma","credit_id":"5470b6829251414f54001c1a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Hartmann","original_name":"Rudolf Hartmann","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Haly","credit_id":"5470b692c3a36850db000049","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gioacchino Rossini","original_name":"Gioacchino Rossini","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/rEOcvlxwKQlOgFpzLPp0Qw6Ig7n.jpg","credit_id":"5470b6b8c3a3680e220004f9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Viller","original_name":"Claus Viller","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5470b6a3c3a3682fad004db8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387928,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mauro Pagano","original_name":"Mauro Pagano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5470b6cb92514112e700563e","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209744,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angelo Anelli","original_name":"Angelo Anelli","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5470b6aec3a3680e220004f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralf Weikert","original_name":"Ralf Weikert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a9e81d9251417db5004005","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256104","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7DXzwpRSwS1V5VTm352m6l0rQ9N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":746}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":222119,"name":"opera live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Live performance","release_date":"1987-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
