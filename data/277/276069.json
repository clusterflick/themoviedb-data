The composer’s music is brought to life on screen through a choreographic staging where actors and dancers, who are seen alternately by themselves or in the company of musicians, attempt to recreate, within a symbolic decor, the universe inhabited by the two lovers.","popularity":0.1312,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Qua Non Média","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frédéric and George","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Great Composers: Frederic Chopin","type":"Brilliant Classics DVD box"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Collection Musique de Chambre: Frédéric et George","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Frederic Chopin and George Sand","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Chamber Music Collection: Frédéric and George","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Frédéric et George (Chopin)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2580243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Montero","original_name":"Gabriela Montero","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61b5920d6a344800889fce25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3344722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Picard","original_name":"Carmen Picard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61b59214223e200042a7d280","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3344723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Dolin","original_name":"Elizabeth Dolin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61b5921cf9183a0041e43b6b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Comeau","original_name":"Phil Comeau","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/wfkLJhCqvVLfzOQsiZCOuyAoS2c.jpg","credit_id":"61b59184d14443006690fb60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3147703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélikah Abdelmoumen","original_name":"Mélikah Abdelmoumen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vpe25f9gVAFsDMMQ4rvqCv07h0R.jpg","credit_id":"61b59198d144430092c95c1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Radio-Canada","release_date":"2001-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
