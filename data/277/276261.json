The film focuses on the feelings of the two new residents in their encounters with other residents, medical staff, social workers, psychiatrists and family. A touching, sometimes painfully honest dramatic experience, it is valuable for in-service staff training, and for all other audiences both professional and non professional, interested in the problems of the aged.","popularity":0.1375,"poster_path":"/1OnYmbiBx7LWoPnqcDl9L3lLOcA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home for Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Quinn","original_name":"Gordon Quinn","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654abe764d0e8d01398f9698","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Quinn","original_name":"Gordon Quinn","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654abe8c41a56133693c1030","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1539771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Temaner","original_name":"Gerald Temaner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654abe691ac2927b2f27450e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1539771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Temaner","original_name":"Gerald Temaner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654abe826beaea00c9fe1994","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431125","wikidata_id":"Q15052460","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1OnYmbiBx7LWoPnqcDl9L3lLOcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kartemquin's officially listed production date.","release_date":"1966-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
