The plot revolves around a fictional opera production that spirals into absurdity as egos clash, misunderstandings abound, and everything goes hilariously wrong. Through a series of farcical and exaggerated situations, Loriot brilliantly mocks the pomp and circumstance of opera while showcasing his signature dry humor and love for absurdity. Noch 'ne Oper is a sharp and witty satire of high culture’s often ridiculous nature.","popularity":0.4114,"poster_path":"/aLglasEiUpIJVOufSpBkllLHCJP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":25167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haerproduction","origin_country":""},{"id":23451,"logo_path":"/etKVcIPvGwznZ8oLbKQjmVIvLIb.png","name":"Polyphon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ein
