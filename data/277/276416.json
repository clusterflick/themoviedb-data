The film revisits the struggles of the nation and examines what drives over 700 Salvadorans to flee their homeland each day, often risking their lives to illegally enter countries in search of a better life for their families. The film also profiles a number of Salvadorans effected by the civil war. One couple, who fled death threats in the 1980s, finds asylum and a political platform in the United States. The film also follows a different couple who, after escaping the war, returned to El Salvador to work with churches and poor communities.","popularity":0.7091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jamie Moffett Media Design & Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to El Salvador","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hector Antonio Garcia Berrios","original_name":"Hector Antonio Garcia Berrios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"564206c092514128a40034e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Brackley","original_name":"Dean Brackley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"564206cec3a3685bd900332a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monsenor Rosa Chavez","original_name":"Monsenor Rosa Chavez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"564206dcc3a3685bd40033dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deysi Cheyne","original_name":"Deysi Cheyne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"564206e7c3a3685bd60035d6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1534094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betsy Morgan","original_name":"Betsy Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nBBRcaMGycxoUxrs2b7aJJAWyG8.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"564206f892514128a10032d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raul Moreno","original_name":"Raul Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5642070892514128a40034f3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Moffett","original_name":"Jamie Moffett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56420605c3a3685bdf00347e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534096,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julia Shields","original_name":"Julia Shields","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56420661c3a3685be2003019","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534095,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Betsy Morgan","original_name":"Betsy Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5642064dc3a3685be80030d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1593775","wikidata_id":"Q7317284","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7605,"name":"el salvador"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
