When her husband Dennis loses his stockbroker job, the couple's traditional family roles switch. As Dennis takes on his new stay-at-home role, Claire's furniture design business takes off. Just as she's beginning to master the art of balancing her home and work life, Dennis serves her with divorce papers and charges her with being an unfit mother. Claire discovers that in a modern courtroom there are still traditional biases unsympathetic to the idea of a woman working three jobs, as a wife, an entrepreneur and a mother.","popularity":4.34,"poster_path":"/rrrqohzXOPramBZNBimksMDsjE6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197582,"logo_path":null,"name":"BEI The Place Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hearst Entertainment Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":29493,"logo_path":"/r7cCKGWlv8AJ23i8FxLwA8x8At1.png","name":"Daniel L.
