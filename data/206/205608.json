In one of the most liberating eras for women in film, she wrote more than 200 movies and was the world's highest paid screenwriter - man or woman. Kathy Bates gives voice to Marion's words from her letters, diaries, and memoirs. Includes commentary by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow, critic Leonard Maltin, and Marion's celebrated biographer Cari Beauchamp. Current women filmmakers reflect on the legacy left to them by Marion and the pioneering women of early Hollywood.","popularity":1.9442,"poster_path":"/bPGwdXXYXIFrcjMKnqzowagcwy3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89247,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA Film and Television Archive","origin_country":""},{"id":10915,"logo_path":"/9NERkCpElyvb6RWNnWp4G4XWAKa.png","name":"Turner Classic Movies","origin_country":"US"},{"id":89248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chaise Lounge Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and the Power of Women in Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Marion","original_name":"Frances Marion","popularity":0.4081,"profile_path":"/mX5lDtPg3Dn4u83k5cNduVJ89nL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4d0cc3a368484e1d4233","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uma Thurman","original_name":"Uma Thurman","popularity":4.841,"profile_path":"/lg04iEqT6TC40H1jz10Z99OFMXx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self -
