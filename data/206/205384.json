The footage includes some of the first battle scenes captured in \"moving pictures.\" Rocha documents his encounters as he scours the film vaults and back rooms of institutions across North America and Europe for the seven reels of film that immortalized Villa. His research unveils a legacy of fictional and documentary depictions of Villa dating from the silent film era, revealing a world unsure whether to venerate or to fear this imposing figure and the forces of popular revolution that he embodied.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/e8D80qF5YpkEnzDlJs9xUAkq29W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los rollos perdidos de Pancho Villa","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregorio Rocha","original_name":"Gregorio Rocha","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/m1ye1mYHIVKNGf0tA1QEp5EIM4Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d07c3a368484e1d3317","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0405280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/e8D80qF5YpkEnzDlJs9xUAkq29W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":684}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
