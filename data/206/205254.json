Before he arrives, we tour the house and hear some evil-sounding cackles, which, it turns out, are coming from a radio one that a ghost was listening to. The ghost then sings the title song while getting ready for a night of haunting, just as Porky arrives. The ghost invites him in with a woman's voice, then disappears. Porky comes in and gets spooked by some flapping curtains. When he comes back in, the ghost puts a couple frogs into a pair of shoes and sets them loose; they collect a hatrack and a curtain, forming a sort of black ghost that ultimately scares Porky upstairs right into the arms of the ghost.","popularity":0.5905,"poster_path":"/i7kWlYHTbsRb7wM2BnhVrxIoMgc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeepers Creepers","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5810cd5a925141568000a574","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5810cd69925141571e00a2e3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Clampett","original_name":"Robert Clampett","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/2x8KjXomM8psGFzNXgsGVbaSm5X.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a368484e1d29c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leon Schlesinger","original_name":"Leon Schlesinger","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/is9gdhtLfaCYwWdeACDgAjdDA1w.jpg","credit_id":"55d330ad92514170c50012a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170169,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ernest Gee","original_name":"Ernest Gee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d3309492514170bf001228","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl W.
