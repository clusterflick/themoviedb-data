To understand more about this iconic Jamaican his long time girlfriend and Oscar nominated actress Esther Anderson describes in some detail along with exclusive unpublished home video footage, their life together at home in Jamaica and of their time spent in Hope Road, London. Of all the people who considered themselves closest to him, Esther was probably the person who knew more about the man's innermost thoughts and fears than any; so much was she in tune with him she even helped to write some of his hit records. Also featured is the last interview he would ever give in the UK when journalist Kris Needs questions him about his foot injury (the injury that would eventually kill him) plus many other topics about which Marley held strong views.","popularity":0.551,"poster_path":"/1Y9vEYWXR6RBR5c4WXjyiupzDJv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bob Marley: Freedom Road adds to the canon of work on the man, providing viewers access to those who knew him the best.","title":"Bob Marley - Freedom Road","video":false,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Bob Marley Freedom Road: The Tracks of the Journey","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ziggy Marley","original_name":"Ziggy Marley","popularity":0.2835,"profile_path":"/9WZVDvWi6P8sg5hQ6JUf017d2SQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d0dc3a368484e1d489d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andres Williams","original_name":"Andres Williams","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/62inSdNTiw2FAq06LEQF326aUk6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4d0dc3a368484e1d48a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Marley","original_name":"Bob Marley","popularity":0.3449,"profile_path":"/v2GrUpvYAuRqf0Mxm8W91WqDH1Y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec4308237b3a90021198c5b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1040501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Anderson","original_name":"Sonia Anderson","popularity":0.171,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d0dc3a368484e1d4895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1297801","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Y9vEYWXR6RBR5c4WXjyiupzDJv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3266,"name":"jamaica"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bob Marley - Freedom Road - The Tracks Of The Journey","key":"uXfv3LDUjC4","published_at":"2012-06-01T12:43:52.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec713c3a368544800acbc"}]}}}
