Set in the 18th century, the film recounts the exploits of Rogers' Rangers, a band of adventurers devoted to seeking out a \"northwest passage\" through Canada. At this juncture, however, Major Rogers (Howard Petrie) is more concerned with helping the British forces at Fort Ticonderoga during a series of French and Indian raids. Top billing is bestowed upon George Montgomery as Captain Pedediah Horn, Rogers' right-hand man. The film boasts two leading ladies: Joan Vohs, as a suspected French spy, and Phyllis Fowler as a married Indian woman who falls in love with Captain Horn. Fort Ti was filmed in 3D, and in typical William Castle fashion the stereoscopic gimmick is exploited to the hilt.","popularity":1.3719,"poster_path":"/r3qFZyUHn5Bz693AaPCQO0EHTZN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esskay Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE FIRST GREAT OUTDOOR EPIC OF AMERICA IN 3-DIMENSIONS","title":"Fort Ti","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Fort Ti","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Montgomery","original_name":"George Montgomery","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/zsk0F93jqPMCV6aIjTR8htp1Iga.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Capt.
