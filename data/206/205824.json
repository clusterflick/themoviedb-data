Through Emery's unique life and career as a civil agitator -- from his beginnings in London, Ontario to his showdown with the U.S. Drug Czar in Vancouver and D.E.A. in Montreal -- the film examines deeper questions: Canadian sovereignty and police integration in a world dominated by its southern neighbor.
