Using voice-over narration, Falardeau presents a compelling analysis of the structure of wrestling and its rituals. The good guy against the evil antagonist, the forces of order and the desires of the crowd. ±  The audience becomes part of the spectacle in this powerful show where wrestlers confront one another under the watchful eye of the referee. It is a ritual of catharsis. The documentary begins with the words, images and sounds of Quebec's political struggle, \"SOS F.L.Q. Continuons le combat\". Produced right after the October Crisis in 1970, a crucial moment in Quebec's struggle to become a sovereign state, independent of Canada, the tape is charged with the bitter experience and political aspirations of the period. We recognize in this tape, the \"Falardeau style\" evident through a very strong narration that supports the images till the end, when the video abruptly closes.","popularity":0.2308,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Continuous le Combat","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Shreve","original_name":"Larry Shreve","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/kUCXTWuwHtFYxeipV5YnWlUXfMe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d03c3a368484e1d2363","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Poulin","original_name":"Julien Poulin","popularity":0.3171,"profile_path":"/6UXNTlS1ooKRutQef6jzrGvoo2d.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d03c3a368484e1d235f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":537978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Falardeau","original_name":"Pierre Falardeau","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/j8f5S6XoDdop89Oi648Ec9DmhkW.jpg","credit_id":"5a1443e6925141366800a561","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0350732","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11479,"name":"social commentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
