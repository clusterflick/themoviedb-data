It was a double performance where parts engraved directly on ±\r 16mm black film are inserted on a background made with the help of a live mixing software. The film is based, on the one hand, on a process of condensation and densification of the original footage of the performance that serves as a departure for interventions that intensify its energetic potentialities.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triptych - 2","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d02c3a368484e1d2195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d02c3a368484e1d219b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187544,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Martignoni","original_name":"Andrea Martignoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d02c3a368484e1d21a1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
