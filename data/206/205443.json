Cinderella, played by Mary Fuller, befriends an elderly resident, who buys a party outfit for her favorite when Cinderella’s elder sister preens for a dance. The new clothes transform the unassuming maiden into the toast of the ball. Finding Cinderella’s missing shoe, a dashing young man follows the clue to his grandmother, Cinderella’s friend at the boarding house, who works her magic to reunite the couple.","popularity":0.1876,"poster_path":"/z40rAsSF9i61ilFpoT8oEXBBFx2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Modern Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","title":"Una cenicienta moderna","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Fuller","original_name":"Mary Fuller","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/7XIkKyvcJ8aEmhZNctVOjDCudMH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"568cd7a39251412e5202f9b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darwin Karr","original_name":"Darwin Karr","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/miU21JZlTzhaW7b4cXJ5VjCshWn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"568cd7ab9251410ffb005b04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Trunnelle","original_name":"Mabel Trunnelle","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/aMWBE1QIuljeiPHZ6JV1dXEoylu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"568cd7d692514169d001be67","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Booth","original_name":"Sydney Booth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"568cd7e2c3a368227b0260be","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold M.
