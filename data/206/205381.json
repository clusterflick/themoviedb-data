While flies drown in his mug of beer, he confronts a life of failure: the wife he ignored, the child he neglected, the teaching duties he has shirked, and his doomed efforts at winning tenure from school officials. Only a dream from the past-the memory of a former liaison with a film star with whom he shared \"the Andechs feeling, a feeling that we are not alone\" - provides sustenance. Despite an unexpected series of events, longing in Achternbusch's world ultimately remains stronger than fulfilment and thirst better than beer.","popularity":0.272,"poster_path":"/e3XFGMz86WtqnUVYPA3CW4aRmVU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":403,"logo_path":"/h2nyRbglJy4d6TN6UDycqpdsLpr.png","name":"Neue Bioskop
