Dat Kho, who's cast includes the beloved Vietnamese inconic anti-war songwriter/poet/artist Trinh Cong Son (1939-2001) who posthumously won the World Peace Music Award in 2004, is a story of the love of family, love of homeland, love of the culture and language of Vietnam and the ethereal love of the ingenue daughter for her fiance, foiled by the antagonistic forces of the ever-present war. A thought-provoking film.","popularity":0.2186,"poster_path":"/evmjom94a1bGgEJejmbHwb3J1y2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Sorrows","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hop Bich","original_name":"Hop Bich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56f0521a92514118470008c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1593936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Công Sơn Trịnh ","original_name":"Công Sơn Trịnh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Trinh Quan","credit_id":"56f05275c3a36871770007b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyen Dot Luu","original_name":"Nguyen Dot Luu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"570967329251414a560009dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quynh Van","original_name":"Quynh Van","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58f665d1c3a368416d0018ce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ha Yuan","original_name":"Ha Yuan","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58f665db9251415df0001828","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hà Thúc Cần","original_name":"Hà Thúc Cần","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f051e8c3a36871770007af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798730,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nguyen Ba Hung","original_name":"Nguyen Ba Hung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6659dc3a36841d30019a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hà Thúc Cần","original_name":"Hà Thúc Cần","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f665a89251415e37001933","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1286779","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/evmjom94a1bGgEJejmbHwb3J1y2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"},{"id":2956,"name":"vietnam"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
