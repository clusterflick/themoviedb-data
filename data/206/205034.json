This accurate &amp; controversial portrayal of life for someone who has fallen victim to bullying and the repercussions which exist, is told by director A.J. Carter in a unique, exposition intensive format with very little use of dialogue. Ronan's Escape presents arbitrary scenes rather than traditional storytelling which provokes audiences into discussion and interpretation of the scenes on a more personal level while reflecting on their own experiences.","popularity":0.2851,"poster_path":"/lCeAzTQBQTe1a5xohlcsNlIHEIC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smooth Motion Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ronan's Escape","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lazarus","original_name":"David Lazarus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ronan","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashleigh Zinko","original_name":"Ashleigh Zinko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louie Vann Praag","original_name":"Louie Vann Praag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gym Instructor","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f27","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirstie Francis","original_name":"Kirstie Francis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Ronan's Mother","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f2b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Hennighan","original_name":"Matthew Hennighan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Colin 'Baton Race Bully'","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f2f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kont","original_name":"Mark Kont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Bus Driver","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f33","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Cammiade","original_name":"Ryan Cammiade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Ryan 'Soccer Bully'","credit_id":"52fe4d01c3a368484e1d1f37","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"A.J.
