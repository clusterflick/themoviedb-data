The restaurant’s menu are hamburgers and pizzas all named after cities and towns along the famous U.S. Route 66, which was then very important road for the American industry as well as road trips. Inspired by the Americanization found in a remote fishing village, Araki coordinated a one-night event at the end of his three-month filmmaking residency stay, where four non-Americans attempt to consume the entire 25-piece menu in one sitting, hence achieving the fastest road trip ever made from Chicago (bacon burger) to Hollywood (beef steak sandwich). A DVD of this video is currently archived in the village’s library, as the only record of eating competition that has ever taken place in the history of Skagastrond.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/olrTqZbz73qsR029xDBC31TSzLl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ROAD MOVIE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yu Araki","original_name":"Yu Araki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f7d6c60f6fa2cfce5f24d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1607,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olrTqZbz73qsR029xDBC31TSzLl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1083}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
