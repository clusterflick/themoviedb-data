But it was an opportunity that could only exist in one place; nature.  She asked a TV celebrity that the students admired and well known for his outdoor adventure prowess, if he would consider coming on a canoe trip down a traditional indigenous river route with 8 boys directly affected by the shooting. And so it was that Les Stroud, creator and host of the international television series Survivorman, boarded a plane for the far northern community of La Loche, Saskatchewan. He had no agenda but to spend time with the students, in the greatest place of healing on earth; the wilderness.","popularity":0.0941,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Loche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Stroud","original_name":"Les Stroud","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/hEmNNqvtHl2vFuDClCdgoIumXUV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Les Stroud","credit_id":"66fa0bdb2c4bdc9db05f8f06","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
