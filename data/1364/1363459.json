C. Rajan and written by G. V. Iyer. It is one of the most popular films of acclaimed Kannada actor Rajkumar, who plays the role of an emperor Kanthirava Narasaraja I of the Wodeyar dynasty, Mysore, who was fondly named as Ranadheera Kantheerava. The film depicts the life of Kanteerava, who is known for his immense physical strength through wrestling. The film was credited to be one of the most authentic historical films made, since it was entirely based on the documents found in the Mysore Palace. The film also stars Udaykumar, Leelavathi, K. S. Ashwath and Sandhya in prominent roles.","popularity":0.1751,"poster_path":"/rakSzBShtUt2b0qTrIMAFGMCrHc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kannada Chalanachithra Kalavidara Sangha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ranadheera Kanteerava","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Rajkumar","original_name":"Dr. Rajkumar","popularity":0.5465,"profile_path":"/5Gzd8OnJS0DIoYLW7tZOCd8NbCC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ranadheera Kanteerava","credit_id":"66f911d12c4bdc9db05f6297","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leelavathi","original_name":"Leelavathi","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/jrZfjaNOjEHROa8hdxJythfhjkE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Doddi","credit_id":"66f911ec271200492ecc4430","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udaykumar","original_name":"Udaykumar","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vishwanatha Shasthry","credit_id":"66f91209621e8616b45f6292","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.
