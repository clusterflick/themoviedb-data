Didier has always been different from other children. What could have been taken for a certain slowness, a tendency to daydream, turns out to be a rare form of disability. All his life Didier will reason like a ten-year-old child, and what child didn't dream of going into space one day? At the age of fifty, Didier then embarks on the fulfillment of this inaccessible dream: to leave the farm in which he works to become an astronaut... even if it means falsifying documents to access the European Space Agency's recruitment session.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When I Grow Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Jacquet","original_name":"Vincent Jacquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66fa4f381a9c9188fecc869a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971547,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florent Tixier","original_name":"Florent Tixier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fa4ee17f13b7b12aa278d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971547,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florent Tixier","original_name":"Florent Tixier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fa4ef27f13b7b12aa278dd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971547,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florent Tixier","original_name":"Florent Tixier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fa4eff271200492ecc822a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Jacquet","original_name":"Vincent Jacquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fa4f13271200492ecc823e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
