Gerrit van Dijk only did executive work. The premiere was in January 1978 in the Haarlem Filmhuis Het Melkwoud. A larger cinema was not allowed to show films with certain content, by order of the Minister of Justice, Dries van Agt. There was a lot of commotion about this, the film reinforced that. The Minister was invited to the screening but said that 'unfortunately' he was unable to attend.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Overtoom","original_name":"Jacques Overtoom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f902740a12215631cc474a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
