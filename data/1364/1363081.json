Fallen leaves speckle gold on the blue stones. Two weary travellers make their way on foot – the painter Meng Huang and writer Ma Jian. When, as if after a long journey, they finally reach a cabin, they eat and drink, but the mood is not one of contentment. Their gaze is dark, haunted by memories of the China they have fled: persecution, resistance and the treatment meted out to those who fight for human rights. With the forest arousing painful thoughts and existential considerations, they talk about art. For the two artists, whose world view has been upended by the Tiananmen Square massacre, creation offers an answer to oppression and lies. But what kind of life remains for the exiles?","popularity":0.1126,"poster_path":"/vSmIZHBfOuNdv9KOS92yL1nSQRT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Among Mountains and Streams","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Lesage","original_name":"Jean-François Lesage","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pjIs2RZzAS3DyvIp7cRlyNHLa0F.jpg","credit_id":"66f7c0e7140fbf6a1a5f21a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961779,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Étienne Roussy","original_name":"Étienne Roussy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d2e67a818713bdf493652","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071389,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathieu Bouchard-Malo","original_name":"Mathieu Bouchard-Malo","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d2e76a818713bdf493660","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922754,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ariane Pétel-Despots","original_name":"Ariane Pétel-Despots","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d2e8a914bae94a1bbbffc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384940,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marie-Pierre Grenier","original_name":"Marie-Pierre Grenier","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/dR3kJUpbZ04N7dWgl23jJpeb4bc.jpg","credit_id":"672d2e9cd98bbc3977ad34b6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570605,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernard Gariépy Strobl","original_name":"Bernard Gariépy Strobl","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/m4UAdmvJdZNqiCmU0o9ZFphoBla.jpg","credit_id":"672d2eaa914bae94a1bbc004","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":777,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3f304NiimYBOBFR6wSx7eKKs8VF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1381},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4NiXDRVAs5SXd9boDHnF1nZ35AE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vSmIZHBfOuNdv9KOS92yL1nSQRT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RIDM","release_date":"2024-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
