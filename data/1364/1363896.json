She is introduced to Henri De Greve, a millionaire who might help her, but she recognizes him to be her former husband, the father of her son, Teddy, and therefore refuses to have anything to do with him. The shock of seeing him is hard on Vanna, and fearing the loss of her youthful beauty, she visits a physician in Vienna to be rejuvenated. Vanna returns thoroughly changed and even invites the attentions of De Greve when she realizes his interest in Sylvia Grayson, Teddy's sweetheart. Teddy turns against his mother, Sylvia attempts to drown herself, and Vanna lures De Greve to her boudoir, where she discloses his past and gives him a beating with a riding crop. Sylvia and Teddy are reunited and forgive Vanna, who now recognizes the folly of vanity and accepts the proposal of long-time admirer Richard Dowling.
