Her maid carefully locks it up in the bureau drawer; but the next morning the necklace is missing. Naturally, the maid is accused, but she denies all knowledge of the whereabouts of the necklace, and puts the blame on the washerwoman, who had called at the time she was locking the jewels up; in consequence, the washerwoman is arrested, and her little son, thrown on his own resources, finds employment with the milkman. Two or three days later, while delivering milk at a fashionable residence, he sees a young lady walking in her sleep, out across the lawn, and follows her to a hollow tree, where he sees her dig up the jewels, which she has hidden on a previous somnambulistic promenade. Of course, this soon leads to the straightening out of all the difficulty. This short is presumably lost.","popularity":0.1247,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":245976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Necklace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pearl White","original_name":"Pearl White","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/sA7nNWkQbYsRWk3UiuU50lKAIB1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Sleepwalking Heroine","credit_id":"66fa80561c5df25f10d0041c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2313836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Octavia Handworth","original_name":"Octavia Handworth","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/i6R31jUuwVMrv9DBJRZA3mK9mxT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Laundress","credit_id":"66fa805fc59a2db32dd0071e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Pickford","original_name":"Jack Pickford","popularity":0.1327,"profile_path":"/iSCajrPZY0pVD4gFrl1PsZyE2kr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Son of the Laundress","credit_id":"66fa806a807cd51c17f188c7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph A.
