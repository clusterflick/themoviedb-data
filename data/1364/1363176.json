The film follows scenes from a traditional Balkan wedding, where songs, dances, and rituals reveal deeply rooted heteronormative values. As he watches these moments, the filmmaker questions his own relationship to marriage as an LGBT individual in a society grappling with change, yet resistant to equality. Will he, as their son, ever have the chance to experience love and marriage the way his parents did? The film explores the dilemma between tradition and modern love, confronting the past with hopes for a future where everyone has the right to love and union without restrictions. Through this personal narrative, the filmmaker addresses the issues of acceptance, family, and dreams that may never become reality in the current social context.","popularity":0.4541,"poster_path":"/dRf5cjjCk2sdhTvIb92IiMx7gZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Archaeology of Community","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavle Hrnčić","original_name":"Pavle Hrnčić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f81bcdf5d56e9ed8a2193a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Poljak","original_name":"Andrea Poljak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f81bd8140fbf6a1a5f4118","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968493,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mateo Rodriguez Petković","original_name":"Mateo Rodriguez Petković","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f81c01f5d56e9ed8a2198a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dRf5cjjCk2sdhTvIb92IiMx7gZx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6038,"name":"marriage"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":13027,"name":"wedding"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":256574,"name":"custom"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sr","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
