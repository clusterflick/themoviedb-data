He is interrupted by Mandy, a masked middle-aged woman who emerges from a rattling old fridge. Mandy claims to be Liam's wife from the future, urgently pleading with him to avoid eating a slug he found in the garden. Mandy reveals that the slug harbors a deadly parasite that will paralyze Liam for 17 years, derailing his life and leading to their eventual meeting in a rehab center. Despite his initial disbelief and mockery, Liam's curiosity and fear gradually give way to a reluctant acceptance of her bizarre story. Mandy's desperate bid to save Liam from a tragic fate culminates in a heartfelt connection. Her mission, however, also carries a poignant consequence: ensuring Liam's safety means erasing the future where they fall in love.","popularity":0.0678,"poster_path":"/4jSUpbPOiY5mVw0Fix1M3z5XjJK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motherland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2024-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wife of the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1677578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillipa Dunne","original_name":"Phillipa Dunne","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/iak7uQaSmbQcznj3emELSOE8hbT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mandy","credit_id":"66f85308271200492ecc2314","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2532476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cal O'Driscoll","original_name":"Cal O'Driscoll","popularity":0.1324,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Liam","credit_id":"66f85314271200492ecc2321","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4324177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiera Crawford","original_name":"Kiera Crawford","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eilish","credit_id":"66f853bf2c4bdc9db05f423f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maeron Libomi","original_name":"Maeron Libomi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"James","credit_id":"66f853ca271200492ecc238b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Hanrahan","original_name":"Rory Hanrahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f85417271200492ecc23b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Hanrahan","original_name":"Rory Hanrahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f85422140fbf6a1a5f49ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Byrne","original_name":"Louise Byrne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8545be7d24ebb2ba2271c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Byrne","original_name":"Louise Byrne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8548e2c4bdc9db05f427f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Killeen","original_name":"Ross Killeen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f856a71a9c9188fecc2c7f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32919722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bqVqFtaoZgEgKi50a2H2ybSfUYl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4jSUpbPOiY5mVw0Fix1M3z5XjJK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1246}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Galway Film Fleadh","release_date":"2024-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
