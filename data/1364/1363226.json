Vita da tifosi","overview":"The Ultras are not ordinary spectators of a football match, but fans who live in a territory sacred to them: the Curva. A sort of non-place that takes the concept of social stratification and subverts it for ninety minutes: the doctor is next to the worker, the craftsman shoulder to shoulder with the lawyer or the “VIP” fan. There are those who struggle to find an identity in everyday life and those who, despite having one, want to lose it at least for the duration of a match. On those steps they are all the same, all brothers, and together they become an autonomous entity within the stadium. For them that sense of belonging is a legacy passed down from generation to generation, from father to son.","popularity":0.2987,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Father to Son - Life as a Fan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4487699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gioele Rotini","original_name":"Gioele Rotini","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ba479706b5536bdc0a9541","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lello Analfino","original_name":"Lello Analfino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gl2sP2ibFexIB71vRd4twgqLiOb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ba493eb7c35459adbec9b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Bocelli","original_name":"Andrea Bocelli","popularity":0.3312,"profile_path":"/jxUwl1tVgXcOwNOsbvbugROmygz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ba49542edc9c13fb0a820e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Ficarra","original_name":"Salvatore Ficarra","popularity":0.1805,"profile_path":"/h3q5f3pg5d6JeSxxz5hxaLTJcR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ba497b55dd812fad466c0f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Costantino","original_name":"Gianni Costantino","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f833722c4bdc9db05f3b81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35504652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":318976,"name":"calcio"},{"id":333328,"name":"sport"},{"id":338196,"name":"ultras"},{"id":338876,"name":"tifo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
