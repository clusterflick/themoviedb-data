Their contents extends from the artists’ somewhat restricted daily lives during COVID, to their dreams, anxieties, and explorations of their local environment. In Suzuki’s case, his hometown of Fukushima sustained severe damage in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, which is a recurring subject in his wider work. “All of a sudden, I found myself participating in an attempt to make a video letter without leaving my room,” he writes. While the letters are mostly filmed in a single location, they in part take place in digital space, building up an impression of three-dimensional intimacy with their “writers.”","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/tT8L0bGh0aQzdj7mYjLGeeXEm7O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Letter Exchange between Buenos Aires, Argentina and Fukushima, Japan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hikaru Suzuki","original_name":"Hikaru Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f7d91e7f13b7b12aa20006","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2868499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franca Malfatti","original_name":"Franca Malfatti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f7d9441a9c9188fecc08ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tT8L0bGh0aQzdj7mYjLGeeXEm7O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
