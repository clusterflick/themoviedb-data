This cinematic endeavor seeks to explore the methodologies employed in observing, scrutinizing, and transmuting the natural world through technological means. The pristine landscape of Hornby Island in British Columbia serves as the project's primary reference point, as it employs extensive analog deconstruction techniques to repurpose the island's scenic vistas. Live dye destructions captured on film are meticulously edited and layered to metamorphose into dynamic motion sequences and novel color palettes, thereby emulating a process of artistic disintegration.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5Tw4ntRX5LyiMBVv1ROEnpjQb1D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Positive Transparencies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2855898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Thodas","original_name":"Marianne Thodas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xOrNRkFgeRnrO6LGu1jkAaK1P0j.jpg","credit_id":"66f96fda271200492ecc5c40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2855898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Thodas","original_name":"Marianne Thodas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xOrNRkFgeRnrO6LGu1jkAaK1P0j.jpg","credit_id":"66f9701e7f13b7b12aa25612","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4970285,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emery Neufeld","original_name":"Emery Neufeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f9703b393cda1d1dcc5650","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Tw4ntRX5LyiMBVv1ROEnpjQb1D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival du Nouveau Cin√©ma","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
