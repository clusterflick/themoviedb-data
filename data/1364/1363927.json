Her husband's business trips leave her home alone for long periods of time and her desire (and mind) begins to wander. Coming home from a particularly excessive trip, Nemo discovers that Patty has been having an affair, and the fists begin to fly. Patty defends herself with a kitchen knife, planting it in her husband's back- opening up her mind to a new world of paranoia, mistrust, and madness. A macabre tale ensues, as Patty meets several strange caricatures along the way: A naive farm boy, cannibalistic backwoods hicks- could these people be real? Or do they only exist in her mind, a place just as dangerous?","popularity":0.3073,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aphasiafilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman Who Split Before Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klara Leopold","original_name":"Klara Leopold","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Patty Cauldron","credit_id":"66fa3db0621e8616b45f9c1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ti West","original_name":"Ti West","popularity":0.4773,"profile_path":"/y65ZHU9m830lbdbggxC8eOT123S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Old Man Conrad","credit_id":"66fa3dca393cda1d1dcc7455","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":88549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Robb","original_name":"Heather Robb","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Candy Promise-Upton","credit_id":"66fa3de90a12215631cc7e57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Graham Reznick","original_name":"Graham Reznick","popularity":0.1554,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nemo Cauldron","credit_id":"66fa3e091a9c9188fecc82d0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick D.
