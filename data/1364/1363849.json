Seeking distraction from his troubles, Freddy enters a vaudeville theater where Undine, \"the diving Venus,\" and her trained seal, Bubbles, are performing. Outside the theater, Freddy meets Undine's fianc√©, George Fitzgerald, and becomes involved in George's effort to hide Undine's seal from a bill collector armed with an order of attachment because of an unpaid hotel bill. Complications arise when Freddy Wetherill's dying rich uncle, Cato Dodd, notifies him that he wants Hyla to nurse him. To insure he stays in his uncle's will, Freddy substitutes Undine for Hyla and takes George along to act as his \"valet.\" Naturally, Bubbles comes along, too. This movie is presumed to be lost.","popularity":0.2787,"poster_path":"/qeD1qwub1CQCwVvINvk9RkNbjGa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thomas H.
