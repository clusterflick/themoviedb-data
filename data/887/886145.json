These travels started a series of records, articulated in a kind of travel log in the style of a modern Marco Polo. This film moves between the gaze of the filmmaker and that of the tourist, at the same time it revitalizes the question for the other in a globalized age, with omnipresent screens. In this posthumous film, Ospina casts his regard on small details, be it common habits or exceptional events.","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":"/2JhEML4ixUCb1sJ3MEdLwfWnRRj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eye of the Tourist: XIII Easy Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Ospina","original_name":"Luis Ospina","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/ypljUU9PAM6h9m41nmd7mhqVS7W.jpg","credit_id":"616c71f2ba131b00614db9aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2JhEML4ixUCb1sJ3MEdLwfWnRRj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1074}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
