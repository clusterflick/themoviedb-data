These works explore proprioception (sense of body position) & kinesthesia (sense of body movement), as meeting points between painting, poetry, voice & improvised music. Guided by intuition, & bypassing a range of traditional inhibitions, Peyrafitte investigates the porosity of her own conscious- and unconscious-ness with, as tangible aim & outcome, a strong desire to reveal the immanent “soul” of that moment. Most often the markings are done with the feet, either in hand-stand or head-stand, and/or with mouth-sprayed charcoals or other natural pigments — hands are rarely used to mark, except for smaller formats.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":"/mg6DeKiBLmwMwDZOj4DGgM6UpBV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karstic Action: I de-suffice myself in confinement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Peyrafitte","original_name":"Nicole Peyrafitte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616d902eba131b00614fd0c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mg6DeKiBLmwMwDZOj4DGgM6UpBV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2L2MUgt1G4KyTErY0ijysrnbcqs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Burnt Video Art and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Galerie Simoncini","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Video Poetry Festival","release_date":"2021-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
