These found sounds are heavily processed and woven into instrumentation ranging from electronically treated guitar to modular synthesizers. Toxic City Music evolved over the course of several years, resulting in a wealth of material which will be re-processed and uniquely presented in an improvisatory manner in live performance. The Wire describes the new work as \"The sound of things falling apart with unbearable slowness…[with Caminiti] reporting his observations with acuity, integrity, and artfulness.\"","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/4cY8e6srLuh8iXsDUG8XvYdsvGB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toxic City Music - Evan Caminiti & Paul Clipson at ISSUE Project Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Clipson","original_name":"Paul Clipson","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/4ecKNR4AJhTel2ttjaACIoryRgc.jpg","credit_id":"616d6494bf31f2002a7b5179","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Caminiti","original_name":"Evan Caminiti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616d648be004a6005f0aac4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4cY8e6srLuh8iXsDUG8XvYdsvGB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
