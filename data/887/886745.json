At the same time, she can \"see\" much more than other people. She believes that with the energy we all have within us, we can achieve things that we thought were impossible. In Dear Darkness, we see how she puts this into practice. Frida is lovingly encouraged by her parents, whom we see in the background as they invite her to experience a sculpture or go swimming with her. Frida has an entirely unique view of the world, from which she occasionally takes a distance so she can listen, feel and think. To do so she seeks out complete darkness, because only if there are no visual stimuli can she find peace. In this way, she hardly differs from her sighted peers-and this is why part of the film takes place in the dark.","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/nZOQ95LNbW8mmvOslmlN6EV0P2H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86782,"logo_path":"/zuXKoPd9apgEOvy6rHthcEjJkR7.png","name":"Filmuniversität Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Хвилі світла","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel N.
