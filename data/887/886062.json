Luke Olutunmogun presents an unconventional plot-free narrative that acts as a visual longitudinal study and diary - exploring feelings of loneliness, alienation, and jadedness amid the death throes of a decaying urban landscape.","popularity":0.2337,"poster_path":"/1tlYUx0ie4wxe5YQ6Sf7WuRymIo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sitting
