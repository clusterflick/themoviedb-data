The filmmakers follow former NASA nuclear physicist, Thomas Campbell, as he shares his knowledge and the results of his research of consciousness, physics, metaphysics and morality to explain mind and matter, normal and paranormal, life, death, and purpose, with all of this logically flowing from the concept of reality as information. The Path: Evolution will undoubtedly challenge the viewer's current belief systems and leave a lasting impression on human beings to re-evaluate how they are behaving, treating others, and existing in the world.","popularity":0.1284,"poster_path":"/68eSCODotUSGL96TK80U81K9lzS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Path: Evolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4734394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skip Atwater","original_name":"Skip Atwater","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - President of the Monroe Institute, Retired","credit_id":"66512013811cf17c1195d932","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4734398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Habernig","original_name":"Michael Habernig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665120ba0b8a4f28e6557599","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7888056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/68eSCODotUSGL96TK80U81K9lzS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Path: Evolution - Trailer","key":"ZcSISHfvJWE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-20T15:34:50.000Z","id":"665123930b8a4f28e65575bb"}]}}}
