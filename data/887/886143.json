Griffith's favorite leading lady and collaborator.","popularity":0.3609,"poster_path":"/5Jl3P3TDL0G5GOf4xWR947FY563.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57679,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":99614,"logo_path":"/gXrb4q4TqBHCYEvjRa16WOE9NRs.png","name":"American Masters Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lillian Gish: The Actor's Life for Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself, Archive footage","credit_id":"616c7178bf31f20061461ef2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(Archive footage)","credit_id":"616c71946bdec3006633c119","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Marie Saint","original_name":"Eva Marie Saint","popularity":0.6241,"profile_path":"/eVkxf868DqzVn9HIlSJHUhRoGA7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"616c71a3037264002cd14860","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Sanders","original_name":"Terry Sanders","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/2ztR1KGOVrkrlEXZoGw7aDVxAH8.jpg","credit_id":"616c7165136545002cc4b039","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1830692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Jl3P3TDL0G5GOf4xWR947FY563.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":295902,"name":"actress"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
