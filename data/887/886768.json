She drives down a highway, arrives at an abandoned house, travels through a seemingly endless corridor of broken-hearted lovers, praises love out of a window, and finds furtive romance in a garden. Familiar domestic spaces are rendered uncanny as she muses on love and its power to intoxicate the world around us. This moody vision is torn apart and laid bare. A frenzied film set is deconstructed and our characters play and revel in the cynical absurdity of this mad human endeavour that simultaneously thrills and depresses us.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":"/z5D3EybkaQgPEV2AhElaN8Y9ph4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Delicate Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Constantine Costi","original_name":"Constantine Costi","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616e1064ba131b00434d4cdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926449,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Charlotte Mungomery","original_name":"Charlotte Mungomery","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616e107cc3aa3f00422b231d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275792,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erin Helyard","original_name":"Erin Helyard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616e10881089ba0028e3eec2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2794630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Vaughan","original_name":"James Vaughan","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/zNwQApGWgNeNqgDFIsu9iNzzTeV.jpg","credit_id":"616e109e53866e0048b76881","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298689,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dimitri Zaunders","original_name":"Dimitri Zaunders","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/uZfTV2lG5SSForAls2xR4el2Tbb.jpg","credit_id":"63b0b9517ef3811fab64caca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Constantine Costi","original_name":"Constantine Costi","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b14c9709a47b69b99f99ca","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15327494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z5D3EybkaQgPEV2AhElaN8Y9ph4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
