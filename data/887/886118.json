Kits Beach Soundwalk is a compositional extension of this original idea. The recording on which this piece is based was made on a calm winter morning, when the quiet lapping of the water and the tiny sounds of barnacles feeding were audible before an acoustic backdrop of the throbbing city. We explore the world of high frequencies, inner space and dreams.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kits Beach Soundwalk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3274546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hildegard Westerkamp","original_name":"Hildegard Westerkamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c62c4d43f010042203e94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
