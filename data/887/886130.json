Rose tells the crowd he doesn’t like showing up to rehearsals (shocker) so this was his warmup, but he nevertheless delivers an impressive, throat-shredding performance throughout, even after injuring a leg mid-gig. He even sounds like he’s having fun. He does the Cool Hand Luke “failure to communicate” monologue himself in “Civil War,” which also features Slash riffing on Hendrix’s “Voodoo Child (Slight Return).”","popularity":0.5396,"poster_path":"/ynlLQsRMEVWybfe0nuYrluAg2I5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guns N’ Roses: Live In New York 1991","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axl Rose","original_name":"Axl Rose","popularity":0.3312,"profile_path":"/oalDuqNecS1XgRJLnpwkAexuojc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"636fcdf32495ab009b03c941","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slash","original_name":"Slash","popularity":0.245,"profile_path":"/ozLDkBhKkUgtxj4EsC0mLP77L0B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"636fce0399259c007df12be7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duff McKagan","original_name":"Duff McKagan","popularity":0.304,"profile_path":"/6Nbg5MScYZnZMyQsRBSk8mo1RSe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"636fce66ca4f67007fc2d784","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Izzy Stradlin","original_name":"Izzy Stradlin","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/1BiXBjmVikJK0nSJ7jnvMU3eYET.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63799666fab3fa007fbf149b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Sorum","original_name":"Matt Sorum","popularity":0.1921,"profile_path":"/2jK0OreCl6SG6YUtHuvyRZ4Us69.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"637b9d7d5b2f4700d583d50b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dizzy Reed","original_name":"Dizzy Reed","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/fSyzPW0n7jfQBUVOGSynRwjZ0av.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"636fce7a172d7f0092da8624","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Pellerin","original_name":"Jean Pellerin","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373ffa746e75f007ba73a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26459157","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/elIAsL61ZQI4WO1OrU9FBHaKimA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/34KpZXJdQSAAHGMXS7s2LKJcKnV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9bOIZKEpHNhqDWJr5UVyblUphNF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o5vjHPLy7MOCDGnNCV3iGKNB7Rg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPe2klLdw8Iu72kSzfn14e5As1b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":845},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUredstJcvqAioJkAmDuulmZdaj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ynlLQsRMEVWybfe0nuYrluAg2I5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lkiH68LWNpBjCuvSkIKuSTVI9aE.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rLFsrsVaICUfryldTOIc5WSnylJ.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":162066,"name":"rock concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bluray","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Guns N' Roses - You Could Be Mine (Live In New York, Ritz Theatre - May 16, 1991)","key":"qnFU-DxwpRs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-06T16:00:12.000Z","id":"665fdc1bbcfc32ac094f5b50"}]}}}
