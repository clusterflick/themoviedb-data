In a tiny mountain town with no road in – and no road out – a community carries secrets of all sizes. But when a young woman with ambition and intelligence collides with a pastor deeply committed to preserving the status quo, cracks begin to appear in the town’s well-constructed façade. And when a stranger appears with a mysterious backstory and the best moonshine anyone’s ever tasted – some of those secrets threaten to spill. With an original folk-country score, this modern-day myth inspired by local lore promises to leave audiences on the edge of their seats.","popularity":0.1811,"poster_path":"/42l9V0xj0wtR8MHnBypgdopNY28.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alliance Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darlin' Cory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Aggers","original_name":"Jeremy Aggers","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z1HPiEZtB4YkFWdw0FO5WdYm1Dg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bailey","credit_id":"616e41836d4c97006535996e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3275967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimez Alexander","original_name":"Jimez Alexander","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/hLPP6PMsf1ZXegn9ao9Ng4z9DkC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gaither","credit_id":"616e41a033ec260061b373d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcello Audino","original_name":"Marcello Audino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4zGkekUBLTbjq8tAIwnL6DAgP1U.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tucker","credit_id":"616e41b203726400957f9948","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bobek","original_name":"John Bobek","popularity":0.2569,"profile_path":"/fJIpO4UEVTrDpbn8rHuj4o2fqou.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Grey / Brody","credit_id":"616e41c6cddbbc002c1ec253","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jewl Carney","original_name":"Jewl Carney","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/47E2mFMZSSdWJdqEYZ0351tlWa7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Alex Crow","credit_id":"616e41dacddbbc0062c41064","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Deal","original_name":"Katie Deal","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/5G570aJes6pqTYjhOBxnQxxW0Aq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Truegood","credit_id":"616e41ef6d4c970027233a67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelli Dodd","original_name":"Kelli Dodd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6RRBKy28scQVxQB3xGuhruqQ28j.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Jenny / Ivy","credit_id":"616e439e3d4d960043319a87","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Lawhon","original_name":"Rob Lawhon","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/wiOUS1IYlYVkwH93QYSzdFO9I2E.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Doug","credit_id":"616e421ddf86a80023e4417c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3275977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhyn McLemore","original_name":"Rhyn McLemore","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/eUIIfqf5vcVYWoWLgHs44sVk64G.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mama Grace","credit_id":"616e42476728a8002a662a71","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3096800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Rabin","original_name":"Gillian Rabin","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/upW65iyEFV5jhRt37hBBY7f9tQN.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Clara","credit_id":"616e4253c8f8580094bde574","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Rodriguez-Sager","original_name":"Maria Rodriguez-Sager","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/l4mxreqlyzdB0s4wTVBMd1BkHSa.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Cass Crow","credit_id":"616e4280c3aa3f00903c1d26","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asia Rogers","original_name":"Asia Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2NctZDrzDtEZNTLavASbwzDfHZ2.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Honor","credit_id":"616e428ce004a600425f4f02","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan V.
