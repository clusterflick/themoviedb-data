The audio track is layered over top of found video footage from Lac Des Mille Lacs, which is the lake beside our Reserve. The editing uses compositing and other techniques to muck around with the footage and build a visual narrative that has themes of Ojibwe cosmology, water and land, the afterlife, the underworld/and skyworld, connection and disconnection to home/homelands/territory and displacement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zsokqAdjcjw7SU3iAhbxIch2ON5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Got No Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2803794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Adler","original_name":"Nathan Adler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616e90d01089ba1d5d2075ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zsokqAdjcjw7SU3iAhbxIch2ON5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2021-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Asinabka Festival","release_date":"2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
