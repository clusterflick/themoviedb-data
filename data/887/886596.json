Never in the history of mankind have so many comic books been published and so many cartoons produced for young people.\r In November 1989, communism collapsed with the Berlin Wall; capitalism was left to decide the future of the world. What if this victory had been prepared for a long time, and our thinking conditioned, from our early childhood, to ensure this absolute triumph?","popularity":0.5651,"poster_path":"/uSb1sqarPrF0hpTgtN8uYg4StaT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112963,"logo_path":"/ccSxSr2Kgdt6jzAjHHvDn8K3xKD.png","name":"Kolam
