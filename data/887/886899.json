Through a kaleidoscope of statements and opinions of the protagonist himself and of composers, critics and also close friends, we get to know a Halftter who is both intimate and creative. His life trajectory is completed with performances by some of the best Spanish music interpreters in emblematic concert halls and sites in Spain.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halffter: 90 Compases","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Vicente Chuliá","original_name":"Juan Vicente Chuliá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616e68511e9225002c9509f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15173982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
