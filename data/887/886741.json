Burned to a crisp, he has always been viscerally fascinated by fire, and instead of rejecting the forbidden embers, he has devoted his life to exalting the flames. Behind the flames, behind the unwavering success of the creator of Focus fireplaces, his life is a fierce battle against pain and the destiny that was promised to him, a path of rebellion and self-affirmation, an unbridled accession to freedom.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/xIuieUm3SzpmTTc3BVCoUu5ZP2b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imbert, derrière les flammes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Imbert","original_name":"Dominique Imbert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"616dfe9a894ed6006463bfd7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1125824,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Céline Kélépikis","original_name":"Céline Kélépikis","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/7YUrA05woujeLILAxkHXye7ZaDl.jpg","credit_id":"616dfe68f92532009000fe96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Mouzas","original_name":"Lucas Mouzas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616dfe296728a8008cb51701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":2159,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7HInv9YkFea8UC8FXk2iX8ctTIN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xIuieUm3SzpmTTc3BVCoUu5ZP2b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
