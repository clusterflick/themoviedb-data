The totalitarian Belarus is gradually becoming deserted, and well-educated people are migrating in droves to the furthest reaches of the world in search of happiness, better career opportunities and a dignified life. I Grew Up As You Slept is a story about emigration, nostalgia and longing for one's family, friends and country. Karalina's film journey, during which she visits her grandmother, who lives in the depopulated Belarusian village of Achaniany, is primarily a journey through time to the land of childhood and memories.","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/s2dF8ewwO3ymcvW7S3o56RTjiZG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Grew Up As You Slept","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Sauter","original_name":"Marcin Sauter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fYhaaD4K4Vey1qnY4Z9wslXOWmY.jpg","credit_id":"616c9a58c8f85800676bcc55","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2668584,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katarzyna Orzechowska","original_name":"Katarzyna Orzechowska","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c9a7203bf8400439bb4fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Sauter","original_name":"Marcin Sauter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fYhaaD4K4Vey1qnY4Z9wslXOWmY.jpg","credit_id":"616c9a4e53866e0068112c99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renata Łukasiak","original_name":"Renata Łukasiak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675dcbdca8d0eb560faa44ea","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Sauter","original_name":"Marcin Sauter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fYhaaD4K4Vey1qnY4Z9wslXOWmY.jpg","credit_id":"675dcbe8551f69f77cadc1a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10129824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/s2dF8ewwO3ymcvW7S3o56RTjiZG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Krakow Film Festival","release_date":"2018-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I grew up as you slept - trailer","key":"287984959","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-09-03T10:22:14.000Z","id":"616c9a19c8f85800265b04fd"}]}}}
