With narratives existing in multiple layers, he induces structural disturbances to visualize the fissures between the real and online worlds. Sleigh Ride Chill begins with a virtual character speeding through downtown Seoul in a room of a fictional character as he narrates a car racing game. The work alternates between the real and virtual as it draws connections with social issues such as suicide clubs, queer parades, and leaks of personal information. For the purpose of the Watch and Chill streaming platform, MMCA produced a special video with the artist talking about Sleigh Ride Chill, as he makes a casual conversation with his colleague/friend Jeon Hyo Gyong (Curator, Art Sonje Center) while driving the same path that appeared in the work both virtually and in real life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interview: Sleigh Ride Chill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
