Somebody suggested to Warhol that they wanted a sexploitation film in the vein of I, A Woman, and so he and Morrissey concocted I, A Man. They created the story of this male hustler who talks with and sleeps with a series of women over the course of the film.  The women are: a young woman who worries about parental acceptance of her sexuality, a woman who is on a couch, a woman with whom he does a seance, a woman who speaks French, a lesbian, and a married woman.","popularity":0.5397,"poster_path":"/pOA3gWWcntNT4bY8jTGFjOQlVrE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, a Man","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"I a Man","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Én, a férfi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","title":"Yo, un hombre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Baker","original_name":"Tom Baker","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/lbzy4STjRM4e36lgcb4VnjHHhSO.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5beab54592514143e604f3ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":985137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Solanas","original_name":"Valerie Solanas","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/zrOYAeHFcU1zzCbPfeSBKqNCHEi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe48e69251416c750b6e3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Superstar","original_name":"Ingrid Superstar","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe48e69251416c750b6e41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico","original_name":"Nico","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/6VyjDb5du0kN0XshCn0l1nO4uRF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"541bf4fb0e0a26123c0037b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1077303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ultra Violet","original_name":"Ultra Violet","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/hO0I2te3nSjsJd0vqHEFflPAQCz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"549d7ac39251411d5300016c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1404319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivy Nicholson","original_name":"Ivy Nicholson","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/5wyOXj0niejWFUBnQvqqTHJYkyh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"549d7acc925141312f006353","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Coffin","original_name":"Bettina Coffin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"549d7ad5c3a3682f1b005cc4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia May","original_name":"Cynthia May","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"549d7ade9251413123005beb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Graves","original_name":"Stephanie Graves","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"549d7ae89251411d53000172","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48e69251416c750b6e2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Morrissey","original_name":"Paul Morrissey","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/BHsQtEW3RGmDY6RZsaXCuJa8z9.jpg","credit_id":"67201ab1769107d77b486733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0220569","wikidata_id":"Q3282342","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/msSSIijHeInAaZmyTl6BMQD3jIt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pOA3gWWcntNT4bY8jTGFjOQlVrE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1997},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6I3zQn40ofrSGDhRCQ4FwoKoUnZ.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kt7uRSXZNeP4SCbmAeZkBVvQp4j.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":178649,"name":"voyeurism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hudson Theater","release_date":"1967-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
