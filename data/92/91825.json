To her surprise, her daughter is the first to be born on Mother's Day and photos appear in the press. Since then, both have to flee. Disguises, false names are the hiding places and the daily life of CHICA, the narrator of this story. Together with her cousin TEO, they reinvent the adventures of their guerrilla fathers, building a fantastic labyrinth of superheroes and strategies around armed subversion, where you never know where reality or madness begins. But the children's game cannot hide the death, torture, accusations and betrayals that live inside the guerrilla.","popularity":0.1892,"poster_path":"/53ADFCL5W0cEGmUfko3PRlZr18j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sudaca
