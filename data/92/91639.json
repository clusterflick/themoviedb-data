Defying the conventions of polite society, Riding moves in with Graves and his wife living as a menage a tois. Then with the arrival of strappingly handsome Irish poet Geoffrey Phibbs, the arrangement becomes a menage a quatre. But soon tensions and rivalries become so fraught that Graves is a suspect for attempted murder.","popularity":1.2221,"poster_path":"/fur5HpsCfKfBnxubPbZHDve9yV5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the Roaring Twenties they rewrote the rules.","title":"The Laureate","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Hughes","original_name":"Tom Hughes","popularity":1.1914,"profile_path":"/ykxpfnJ5Fm0Zrx3MbE7yjRzF0b4.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Robert Graves","credit_id":"5e4d930b1e92250015c898d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dianna Agron","original_name":"Dianna Agron","popularity":1.0872,"profile_path":"/aN8mWrCE7zPMcYbP5pkxAke2B6M.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Laura Riding","credit_id":"5e4d92ffa93d25001a424c5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":209578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Haddock","original_name":"Laura Haddock","popularity":1.9252,"profile_path":"/6kRUvA7N3pMzznG9PdiqCOvxhGQ.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Nancy Nicholson","credit_id":"5e4d92e335811d00194f567f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fra Fee","original_name":"Fra Fee","popularity":0.3294,"profile_path":"/1UnZxfqaRTpoqpafM9PEAvlHAc7.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Geoffrey Phibbs","credit_id":"5fae785c7f0540003d1eb059","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Hodge","original_name":"Patricia Hodge","popularity":0.4361,"profile_path":"/e9IwLFI1kB9hWCyH47S2GDkkpp6.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Amy Graves","credit_id":"5e4d9335283ed900155c7f63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Glover","original_name":"Julian Glover","popularity":0.5811,"profile_path":"/yqFGLoY6CRy9jGp3NI328VlsaIG.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Alfred Graves","credit_id":"5e4d931ca93d25001a424c97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2412376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indica Watson","original_name":"Indica Watson","popularity":0.3743,"profile_path":"/3MaP7WuEcLQ5VXbIgwUvs9KT1rL.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Catherine Nicholson","credit_id":"5e4d934d1e92250015c89935","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meriel Hinsching","original_name":"Meriel Hinsching","popularity":0.163,"profile_path":"/orBdbjt7E2ZOIPUIPw39yzmAQXv.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Elfriede","credit_id":"5fae7873db4ed60040b12f4b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Renouf","original_name":"Timothy Renouf","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/7po8BdFlkJmLheLVqB2QgdnqoPp.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Siegfried Sassoon","credit_id":"5fae7895924ce600406e4638","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christien Anholt","original_name":"Christien Anholt","popularity":0.4434,"profile_path":"/y2eG3pw8aAlTHtoOyeeMDVGgfnH.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"T.
