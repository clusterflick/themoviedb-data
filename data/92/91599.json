This engaging, optimistic documentary tracks a unique development project: a shiny new beauty school, funded in part by beauty-industry mainstays, which sets out to teach the latest cutting, coloring, and perming techniques to practicing and aspiring Afghan hairdressers and beauticians. The American teachers, all volunteers, include three Afghan-Americans returning home for the first time in over twenty years. The Beauty Academy of Kabul offers a rare glimpse into Afghan womenâ€™s lives, and documents the poignant and often humorous process through which women with very different experiences of life come to learn about one another.","popularity":0.3638,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-05-04","revenue":225399,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After decades of war and the Taliban, the women of Afghanistan need... a makeover?","title":"The Beauty Academy of Kabul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980232,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Saetre","original_name":"Linda Saetre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b6b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ahmad Zahir","original_name":"Ahmad Zahir","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b5f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Mermin","original_name":"Liz Mermin","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980231,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheri Levine","original_name":"Sheri Levine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b65","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Noble","original_name":"Nigel Noble","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84378,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Fraser","original_name":"Nick Fraser","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b71","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Mermin","original_name":"Liz Mermin","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b77","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Mermin","original_name":"Liz Mermin","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980228,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcella Steingart","original_name":"Marcella Steingart","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5b53","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anna Rieke","original_name":"Anna Rieke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb0c83925141044e255cfb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1981290,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lynda Hall","original_name":"Lynda Hall","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccb0c75c3a36836b0d97cfd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0439130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3541,"name":"afghanistan"},{"id":9749,"name":"beauty salon"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
