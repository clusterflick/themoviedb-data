They avoid being killed by faking a case of the pox, which causes the panicked captain and crew to desert the ship. The two find themselves alone, and when a lucky cannon shot hits a mast on a British ship, they find themselves mistaken for pirates. They sail to Tortuga, where they recruit such notorious corsairs as Henry Morgan, Captain Kidd, Anne Bonney, and Blackbeard to lay siege to Chaleston and expose the villain Elden.","popularity":1.202,"poster_path":"/w8LXPuey8jXX2Dv3mGMWt0A5nv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10330,"logo_path":"/vevakirICdmHxRPeZUdbjFqcFLM.png","name":"Universal International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yo-ho-ho-ho ... it's a battle of fun !","title":"Double Crossbones","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald O'Connor","original_name":"Donald O'Connor","popularity":0.5852,"profile_path":"/sV7Dx16wcajPsxJItmW5dX4axoW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Davey Crandall","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Carter","original_name":"Helena Carter","popularity":0.2197,"profile_path":"/5iKWcK3HbVB5oILrWibf122xsnX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lady Sylvia Copeland","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Geer","original_name":"Will Geer","popularity":0.448,"profile_path":"/lpiuWaZxn0dov4FoYE6fxtsee8c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Botts","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Emery","original_name":"John Emery","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":"/kuzWbz3ACuW8UeD5CX90uSjMdYn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Governor Elden","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Logan","original_name":"Stanley Logan","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/nnvJcqpODM0s74pUiy5rlnDbVuF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lord Montrose","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f6b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":163340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Givney","original_name":"Kathryn Givney","popularity":0.1892,"profile_path":"/sCAID3HDTETbA4GLUn2OKZFaqMi.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lady Montrose","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f6f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayden Rorke","original_name":"Hayden Rorke","popularity":0.3373,"profile_path":"/8HuJziNroZGIv6NFZMO6baifZSP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Malcolm Giles","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f73","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Farley","original_name":"Morgan Farley","popularity":0.1873,"profile_path":"/duhdbw2KGi4m8gf7CMV7YMsps6T.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Caleb Nicholas","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f77","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Barrat","original_name":"Robert Barrat","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/beNgSV6zWEfGV1ikiPGz94uMbOS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henry Morgan","credit_id":"52fe48df9251416c750b5f7b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Napier","original_name":"Alan Napier","popularity":0.516,"profile_path":"/90TwBLqH94JqWeVBXqkkYR2wsp2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Capt.
