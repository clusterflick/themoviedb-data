It's time to get gangsta gangsta. Ninja and Yo Landi are wheelchair-bound lovers and real gangstas. They live in the outskirts of civilization, they shoot guns for fun, smoke massive joints, and sleep in the woods. They don't have any bling to show for their gangsta cred, but the world deserves to know who they are. They're tramps, and their wheels are starting to fall off. Ninja become despondent over their vagabond existence, but Yo Landi won't let him give up. What ensues is straight up gangsta mayhem, the realist of the real, true gangsta shit.","popularity":0.1426,"poster_path":"/vKaPL2Mr5PUoAjX8105PSPOMgon.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bring me my machine gun","title":"Umshini Wam (Bring Me My Machine Gun)","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":54,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bring me my machine gun","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":985040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yo-Landi Visser","original_name":"Yo-Landi Visser","popularity":0.5073,"profile_path":"/pGWfRyNwcdv4SX9O1yrrlWLvxtI.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Yolandi Visser","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b615f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninja","original_name":"Ninja","popularity":0.3386,"profile_path":"/bPGSIAVXhDyghaGTdhMEonvtGtw.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Ninja","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b6163","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clayton Bezuidenhout","original_name":"Clayton Bezuidenhout","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Rims Salesman","credit_id":"6151d23de8a3e1002c08a453","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hector Bezuidenhout","original_name":"Hector Bezuidenhout","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Wheelchair Salesman","credit_id":"6151d25bf04d010091c94462","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985051,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew \"Pat\" Patrick","original_name":"Andrew \"Pat\" Patrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b6175","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985053,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"The Mill","original_name":"The Mill","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b6181","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":985052,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Luke Colson","original_name":"Luke Colson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b617b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harmony Korine","original_name":"Harmony Korine","popularity":0.5038,"profile_path":"/nifHx1FlQdgYw57QaUfHSjBKmPy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b616f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harmony Korine","original_name":"Harmony Korine","popularity":0.5038,"profile_path":"/nifHx1FlQdgYw57QaUfHSjBKmPy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48e09251416c750b6169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1866286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vKaPL2Mr5PUoAjX8105PSPOMgon.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tlBuNWfyzWpnAe4SojreDyV2C4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1419,"name":"gun"},{"id":2564,"name":"wheelchair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
