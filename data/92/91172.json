She finds a small museum, where the proprietor invites her in to have a look around before leaving. In one room, she encounters a strange jar which causes her to have strange visions, visions that are supposedly drawn from her own mind. These 'visions' make up the rest of this four- part anthology, which includes horror and suspense stories about a junkie chasing a dog for his runaway fix, a pizza delivery boy who gets a Halloween surprise, a living but paralyzed OD victim forced to undergo her own autopsy because everyone thinks she's dead, and a deal between a golf course owner and a gravedigger that has some unexpected consequences.","popularity":0.8626,"poster_path":"/rMx3EHvlwjETsSsmV6U1fBtAPCd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shapiro-Glickenhaus
