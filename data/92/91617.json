Described as “Greek, Moresque, and Celtic with a dash of the Egyptian, the Persian, and the Japanese,” the room provided a fitting setting for one of the most eclectic and culturally curious artists in music today.  Amos performed a career-spanning set featuring classics from her debut Little Earthquakes through to Abnormally Attracted to Sin.  A candid interview with Tori is also included.  Tori Amos is one of the most influential and respected artists of the modern era.  The double-digit Grammy nominee has recorded 11 acclaimed studio albums (and gone platinum nearly 20 times) since emerging in the early ’90s.  She released two new CDs in 2009:Abnormally Attracted to Sin and her first seasonal project, Midwinter Graces.","popularity":0.134,"poster_path":"/bWuFsA8uwPtnGmvsF852W211zT1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tori Amos: Live from The Artists Den","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tori Amos","original_name":"Tori Amos","popularity":0.2256,"profile_path":"/kXCanmLz0gmgScQcQnfis95NeHe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Vocals, Piano","credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5cc3","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhnmLChce4Idd8e326dkkT5HYoW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bWuFsA8uwPtnGmvsF852W211zT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1031}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
