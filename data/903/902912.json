Show, created in collaboration with Texas Tech University, \"Dr. Videovich\" goes to Texas. He takes the pulse of the public by asking the residents of the town of Lubbock for their opinions on art, television, and art-on-television. An affectionate portrait of a diverse community, Saludos Amigos! is also Davidovich's comedic masterpiece. In this satirical inquiry into American television viewing habits, Davidovich investigates the complicated dynamic that can exist between specific local histories and a more over-arching sense of national identity. The piece includes footage of Bob Hope fielding the artist's questions on the topic of video art at a press conference.","popularity":0.1862,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saludos Amigos!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hustoles","original_name":"Paul Hustoles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62570dd9a589020068efcf29","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Davidovich","original_name":"Jamie Davidovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62570da5a33612009a98c1bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505302,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fred Senatore","original_name":"Fred Senatore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62570dc097a4e6009acb9012","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
