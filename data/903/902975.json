A world far away from city noise and so called  “modern culture”. A world that was created by God, not by human beings. Jonas, called by the villagers the “Bull”, because of his unbelievable strength, lives in such a world. He walks through his life unrushed and certain, reminding a today‘s man of his fragility. He reveals a world where life and death, joy and sadness, power and weakness coexist together inseparably, a world which fills up with apocalyptic visions and the “end of the world” feeling.","popularity":0.1279,"poster_path":"/ypJYH1wkgOd8Tr7yjK6bxUe25PF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monoklis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dzukija’s Bull","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linas Mikuta","original_name":"Linas Mikuta","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sDvpkh2ml3sNd537C3BRKKc3Oec.jpg","credit_id":"64f6364c5f2b8d011b4f3299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linas Mikuta","original_name":"Linas Mikuta","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sDvpkh2ml3sNd537C3BRKKc3Oec.jpg","credit_id":"64f636558e20c500c59526e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kristina Sereikatė","original_name":"Kristina Sereikatė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f6366a12197e0138b5c936","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linas Mikuta","original_name":"Linas Mikuta","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/sDvpkh2ml3sNd537C3BRKKc3Oec.jpg","credit_id":"64f636723d43e038923ade09","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kristina Sereikatė","original_name":"Kristina Sereikatė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f6367a5f2b8d00c4342923","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1974782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Skodvin","original_name":"Erik Skodvin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f63689ebb99d00e454a0fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2144729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lina Semaškaitė","original_name":"Lina Semaškaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f6369077d23b00cb885720","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jurga Gluskinienė","original_name":"Jurga Gluskiniene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f63697ebb99d011e0b7762","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28944965","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ypJYH1wkgOd8Tr7yjK6bxUe25PF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
