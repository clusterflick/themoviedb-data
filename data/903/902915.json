Equipped with helmet, goggles, and a basic understanding of early video game strategies, the artist morphs into an adventureland training camp where she meets with media icons and common ground. She fearlessly changes her intensity and velocity in unison with, and at times under the command of, rival action-heroes and network sponsors.
