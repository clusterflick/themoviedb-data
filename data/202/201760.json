But this case is different because the trip is used as an excuse to illustrate, through documentary techniques, the deep contrasts of Mexican society. Tired of the city, Javier goes to visit his aunt, an eccentric woman with quite radical ideas, who lives isolated from the world in a ranch in Querétaro. Javier works as a laborer for an Argentinean foreman, with whom he shares a few passions. His life begins to change.","popularity":0.13,"poster_path":"/aR2pHqVzr1iWxs4mBPMGFQ9Q5m4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pan O
