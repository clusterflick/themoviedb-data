A pianist, singer, rapper, accordion player, and magician, he's a demented Renaissance man and a multi-cultural mixmaster. THE SOCALLED MOVIE is a kaleidoscopic portrait which compiles 18 short films that display his electrifying craft and deep-rooted sense of history. Combining traditional Yiddish songs with funk, rap and everything in between, his tunes are densely layered tapestries of dizzying complexity.  His encounters with legendary trombonist Fred Wesley (a key member of James Brown's bands) and klezmer hero David Krakauer are revelatory meetings of the mind, while his re-discovery of pianist Irving Fields turns the elder statesman into a YouTube phenomenon. With offbeat wit, intimacy and virtuoso performances, THE SOCALLED MOVIE is an enthralling documentary that shows how music can break down the boundaries that divide our world.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 'Socalled' Movie","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1184013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Dolgin","original_name":"Josh Dolgin","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4cb6c3a368484e1c3ba7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garry Beitel","original_name":"Garry Beitel","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cb6c3a368484e1c3bad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1649416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
