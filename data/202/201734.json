But as this gripping doc reveals, the cost to bring such delicacies to the table is enormous. Bestselling novelist Jonathan Franzen takes a break from the world of fiction to guide us through an all too horrifying reality: tens of millions of protected migratory songbirds are illegally killed every year. Franzen, a longtime bird lover, accompanies young staffers of the Committee Against Bird Slaughter on their expeditions. With police enforcement in Southern Europe practically non-existent, they risk their lives to rescue trapped birds, and confront hostile poachers. It's a topic that proves a cultural flashpoint -- the Cypriot landowners cannot understand why a bunch of Italians can tell them what to do on their land.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/wAsyeC63KMGot3wdTKIBE6valdZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emptying the Skies","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Kass","original_name":"Doug Kass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"532f82e8c3a3685fbb005100","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":960477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Kass","original_name":"Roger Kass","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"532f83169251413a78004147","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3302498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/apLM3ACY4fxxST2cwt8c5nPXi0v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAsyeC63KMGot3wdTKIBE6valdZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Emptying the Skies Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Documentary HD","key":"N_OtCDWjBYM","published_at":"2015-04-10T21:33:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5534e3a79251417ae300506d"}]}}}
