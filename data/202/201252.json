Just like a kid afraid of the dark, the Boogeyman has made her afraid to close her eyes. Annie soon realizes her hideous dreams are predictions.

Their actions are very brave, but are Annie and her friends the hunters... or the hunted?","popularity":0.3909,"poster_path":"/pYHdzliTEqA47AYTEEa1OwyDQJK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27212,"logo_path":"/a4Kg3zFsN9cSzwxQvf64QOSfEUk.png","name":"Simitar Entertainment
