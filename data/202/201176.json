Elderly Noel takes pride in having worked this land nearly all his life. His son Marc now carries most of the responsibilities of the farm (as well as the debts), and he's starting to buckle under the strain. And Marc's son Nicolas hasn't decided what to do with his life; he has little interest in farming, but he isn't sure where his real talents lie. One day, after helping his cows give birth to new calves, Marc gets word that he must destroy all his cattle to prevent the spread of Mad Cow Disease. This proves the last straw for Marc, and he commits suicide. Noel doesn't handle his son's death well and ends up in a retirement home, while Marc's wife gets a job as a cashier and Nicolas looks for work (with little success) while searching for a beautiful and mysterious woman to whom he gave a ride.","popularity":0.3159,"poster_path":"/el7p3KjyWgV6Dp4RGehdPCDAUqF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C'est quoi la vie ?","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Caravaca","original_name":"Éric Caravaca","popularity":0.2276,"profile_path":"/yJkhAfF1flznA2GzLWah2nDecIa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nicolas","credit_id":"52fe4ca1c3a368484e1bfcc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Dufilho","original_name":"Jacques Dufilho","popularity":0.1652,"profile_path":"/7CK8OE5ww4AOdH61M1jVMZeimjE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Noël","credit_id":"52fe4ca1c3a368484e1bfccd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","popularity":0.4378,"profile_path":"/bFIJ3bdn5bjx3r5Tm4VPjlaxwfr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marc, le père","credit_id":"52fe4ca1c3a368484e1bfcd1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Renauld","original_name":"Isabelle Renauld","popularity":0.3283,"profile_path":"/sFCZqQFyxiznqsCIJZ1FPDNqgLQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"52fe4ca1c3a368484e1bfcd5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Dupeyron","original_name":"François Dupeyron","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/pxrBB661NH9TCAAzSkeu2ACdS0X.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ca1c3a368484e1bfcc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4430791,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Liliane Caille","original_name":"Liliane Caille","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657bbcf4ec8a4300e09ba83a","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0202283","wikidata_id":"Q2930370","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/el7p3KjyWgV6Dp4RGehdPCDAUqF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
