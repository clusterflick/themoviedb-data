With smaller villages falling one by one, the largest families are in position to vie for their share of the power. Sankai of Minamiyama has his sinister eyes fixed – not only on total control of the area, but on Kagerou as well. After fleeing the village of Shiroyama, Kagerou and Aoi have been relentlessly hunted. And now, with the civil war in full flux, and Aoi in enemy hands, it is time for one last attempt to escape the clutches of the deadly Shinobi hierarchy – or die trying. They are all alone. They can trust no one. They must find a way out.","popularity":0.7532,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3560,"logo_path":"/yOsrKcVSpC9ofAkE6hJjvC8sW9u.png","name":"KSS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3465,"logo_path":"/x8my1WrmOQa8P68XrZPixPBnSkm.png","name":"ADV Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Section 23 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":15503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jidasu","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A final surge to live unbound","title":"Shinobi 4: A Way Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenji Matsuda","original_name":"松田賢二","popularity":0.3733,"profile_path":"/wYncI1dyUTBywueIwSVzOfDxq8a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kagerou","credit_id":"52fe4ca8c3a368484e1c11db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":555057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maju Ozawa","original_name":"小沢真珠","popularity":0.429,"profile_path":"/iQsDbYzYHxCoY0bQCKPoaNuJPwi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aoi","credit_id":"52fe4ca8c3a368484e1c11df","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenji Tanigaki","original_name":"谷垣健治","popularity":0.5014,"profile_path":"/2ZV2n02pZq1Sc2szQuyF1HVssi7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ca8c3a368484e1c11e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190550,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoshiyuki Maejima","original_name":"Yoshiyuki Maejima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca8c3a368484e1c11eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4069200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":1721,"name":"fight"},{"id":1938,"name":"sword"},{"id":10278,"name":"ninja"},{"id":10491,"name":"swordsman"},{"id":192774,"name":"koga"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
