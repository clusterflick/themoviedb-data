The story begins with the inventor of the world's first electronic instrument, Leon Theremin, unveiling the KGB's huge pile of fascinating devices, some of which were musical. They all came into existence as a by-product of a rampant defense industry. Nowadays, those aged and abandoned 'musical coffins', as solidly made as a Kalashnikov, are being recycled and reinterpreted by the post-Soviet generations of musicians, sound collectors and circuit benders. The story of the Soviet synthesizers as an allegory to the everyday life under the Soviet system: nothing works, but you have to make the best out of it. An electronic fairy tale about the inventive spirit of the free mind inside the iron curtain- and beyond.","popularity":0.1472,"poster_path":"/z0L4Wc5O2RSz6w7o8lrzW6riJHY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
