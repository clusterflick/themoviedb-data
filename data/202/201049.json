He here presents the man in the street as a film protagonist whose reality lies somewhere between a dream and a nightmare. In these three aesthetic reinterpretations, Provost, using seemingly insignificant raw material, not only moulds mystical spaces that compellingly absorb the viewer, but also masterfully shows that the dream-world called 'cinema' is simply a constructed parallel reality comprising clich√©s, technical rules and dramaturgical conventions.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/aAsPM5wL9rFF3A5alGz3ZjykUZm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Giants","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Provost","original_name":"Nicolas Provost","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/c3nDpKUfl0wohIwbYG26zXWX33v.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c9dc3a368484e1bef79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2665478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aAsPM5wL9rFF3A5alGz3ZjykUZm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
