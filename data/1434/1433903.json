As Gregory Doran's directorial vision unfolds, traditional African dance is seamlessly integrated into Caesar's triumphant entrance and Mark Antony's funeral speech, while the set designers create a palpable atmosphere of dictatorship and unrest.  Cyril Nri (Cassius) discusses how the cast draws on African leadership archetypes to infuse the narrative with cultural relevance, and Paterson Joseph (Brutus) reflects on his character's internal conflict, highlighting how it mirrors the difficult choices faced by contemporary revolutionaries. The documentary intersperses live performances with audience reactions, highlighting the powerful resonance of the adaptation.","popularity":1.3608,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":253456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illuminations","origin_country":""},{"id":5845,"logo_path":"/5ncpOZ3B1Jlb7XnMJlBho1BHCIs.png","name":"Royal
