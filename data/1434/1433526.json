The struggling pilot banks a turn to escape the dense cloud cover.  His senses deceive him, telling him the planes has stopped turning.  So he turns harder.  But the nose drops.  Speed picks up.  And suddenly he's caught in a downward spiral, a graveyard spin.\r In Signposts Aloft, you'll find our how man's senses can be fooled in flight.  You'll see experiments that dramatically illustrate the problems pilots and astronauts face.  And you'll learn why man needs outside guidance from God, just as pilots need to place faith in their instrument panels.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iaZtqlcLsgRWBtSWxsbEYBRrokU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signposts Aloft","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":2120,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iaZtqlcLsgRWBtSWxsbEYBRrokU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
