These are, first of all, the stories of people who knew the writer closely: Elena Vladimirovna Nabokova-Sikorskaya - “the favorite sister of the favorite brother”, as Vladimir Vladimirovich called her, and Nabokov's son Dmitry Vladimirovich. Nabokov, who became a genius of two languages and two literatures, is an exceptional case.  The film crew visited America, where Nabokov, an American professor of Russian literature, taught at Cornell University for a long time. The viewer will also see the St. Petersburg mansion and the house in Rozhdestvensko estate, where the happy childhood of the future writer took place, his apartment in the hotel in the Swiss town of Montreux, where Nabokov lived the last sixteen years of his life.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/7bWUnHxqZ90FkwByo1LPQynf5q2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Age of Nabokov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Age of Nabokov","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Век Набокова","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Parfyonov","original_name":"Леонид Парфёнов","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/ljmHFvLW6vQ7P3S16yKblsaSu9M.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67ac774f21d0a92d4b9ba3e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Parfyonov","original_name":"Леонид Парфёнов","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/ljmHFvLW6vQ7P3S16yKblsaSu9M.jpg","credit_id":"67ac77817f2fa9eb79bb39e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1783351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Skvortsov","original_name":"Ivan Skvortsov","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ac779521d0a92d4b9ba40f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Parfyonov","original_name":"Леонид Парфёнов","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/ljmHFvLW6vQ7P3S16yKblsaSu9M.jpg","credit_id":"67ac77c021d0a92d4b9ba43a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/utZJWZwzSWwxfO2StCeDRrDCR88.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXigdb6gXWqvRxyegKoWJr4k8ai.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7bWUnHxqZ90FkwByo1LPQynf5q2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":194208,"name":"nabokov"},{"id":346826,"name":"набоков"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
