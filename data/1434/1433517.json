Suddenly the jaws of a carnivorous plant clamp shut.  It's dinnertime for the Venus Fly Trap.  Long before man invented traps to capture his food, these carnivorous plants were putting them to work.  In fact, many of man's most ingenious inventions have been borrowed from God's original designed in nature.  In Prior Claim, you'll explore the world of the trap-door spider, the archer fish, the rattlesnake, and many other fascinating animals that reflect the inventive genius of God.  And you'll see how the Creator has prior claim not only on ideas and inventions, but also on human lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8z1hm3iCIiRqbqeGNyaXkRh6rAW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prior Claim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2141,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8z1hm3iCIiRqbqeGNyaXkRh6rAW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
