Twelve-year-old Mikal was born and raised in a hotel room he shares with his parents, who struggle with substance abuse. Driven by love and a desire for a better life, his greatest wish is for his mother to stop drinking. Mikal is bright and articulate, but his parents’ struggles prevent them from giving him the stability he needs. Through Mikal’s perspective, the film paints an intimate portrait of resilience, hope, and the harsh realities of life on society’s margins.","popularity":0.3705,"poster_path":"/xzmUaWJWbSkS9G74R9yY6oraJ9q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257878,"logo_path":"/5UNKg320v8ftU3cAvH0WAWDGdyw.png","name":"Fri
