Or would create dozens of nonfiction stories in and about China. China: Frame by Frame explores what he discovered, what he learned and the dramatic changes he witnessed. “Sometimes it’s difficult to put modern Chinese history into words, so I am relying on the pictures.” Those pictures include original interviews and scenes shot throughout China, as well as little seen historical footage found in perhaps the most unlikely of places: America’s National Archives and the Library of Congress.","popularity":0.1066,"poster_path":"/weGECZvEk5NnkEXe6wuLCmvJsEh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox
