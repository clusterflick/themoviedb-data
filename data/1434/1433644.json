But after a few minutes and an almost make-out session, we discover Ashley's not actually the bride's cousin, but the groom's ex -- and here to win him back. Thus begins a farcical whirlwind of characters entering and exiting, declaring their love, taking it back, and ultimately - making the right choice. Because every decision is the right one, as long as you make it. This is a comedy of errors about the nature of love and impossibility of making decisions.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/xvpyj4XyyWjmDytLzDzEGtl7AVW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Station 26
