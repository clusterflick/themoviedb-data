The film was intended to be shown as an educational film in film projectionists' courses, but due to its comedic content, it was also shown at public screenings. Oscar Lindelöf (1887–1954), a pioneer of Finnish cinema, plays a triple role as a reckless projectionist, the projectionist-in-charge of Kino-Palatsi and the instructor of a projectionist course.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pOAAXs96vAAc8tKxDb15dFwdN2a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Movie Theatre Before and Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5243141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Wecström","original_name":"Rafael Wecström","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ad108ad0fd64d9f2d0af62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pOAAXs96vAAc8tKxDb15dFwdN2a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"K-12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"Tampere Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
