After a first trip in 1968 on JFK's footsteps, Okamura moved to Ireland in 1969 with his family, and spent the next 15 years of his life photographing the north and the south of the island. Exploring his unique perspective as both an insider and an outsider, this short film offers a nuanced portrayal of the complexities and contradictions of human nature. Through interviews, archival footage, and Okamura's own evocative photographs, we invite audiences to contemplate the universal themes of resilience, empathy, and the enduring quest for peace in the face of adversity. \"The Memories of Others\" is a testament to the power of visual storytelling in capturing the essence of human experiences amidst conflict.","popularity":0.1452,"poster_path":"/uT8bG15etpn8eYu7sRrIaRGK6hQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucky Tiger Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2024-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Memories of Others","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauline Vermare","original_name":"Pauline Vermare","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd41e7241eef4869f332c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3338394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Lesser","original_name":"Marc Lesser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd4348c5579ba6e36ce8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3338394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Lesser","original_name":"Marc Lesser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd4408c5579ba6e36ce91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauline Vermare","original_name":"Pauline Vermare","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd4488c5579ba6e36ce97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3338394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Lesser","original_name":"Marc Lesser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd44f645669137e9f31c9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3338394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Lesser","original_name":"Marc Lesser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd45a8c5579ba6e36ce9e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242741,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noah Avidan","original_name":"Noah Avidan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd46c21bcf1821e9f2e4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242741,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noah Avidan","original_name":"Noah Avidan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd4773ee708327c36db8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242742,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Myers","original_name":"Thomas Myers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd4ce21bcf1821e9f2e64","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32508346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"LuckyTigerProductions","instagram_id":"luckytigerproductions","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uT8bG15etpn8eYu7sRrIaRGK6hQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Photo Museum Ireland","release_date":"2024-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
