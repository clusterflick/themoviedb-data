It is a recursive aesthetic exploration of the reconciliation between the necessary and the contingent / sublime and the mundane within the framework of cognition and the potentiality in which objects are inscribed. Through faciality and abstraction as sign production, third extension works with language and the map in a framework of cybernetic openness, constructing an extensive narrative that allows for the absorption of contingencies and posits models of intelligence and learning.  Signified and signifier appear in a dance of figure and ground, working with text boxes that are in constant dialogue with schematic audiovisual samples that form third powers / axis of reconciliation in scenarios that oppose each other, determining axes of symmetry that break down.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"third extension","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0f6bcddbc64cc91363744","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0f6d62a9e96da8d6c534f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0f6e470c8865ebd3635f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0f6f914263d4fe76c507a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zqp4PzTvOPSfQ9s0h2NYvePK6qt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
