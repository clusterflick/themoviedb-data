She's reduced to working in a bar in the seedy part of town as a \"hostess\", where she meets a down-on-his-luck Englishman. While drunk he gets into a fight, and is forced to kill his opponent in self-defense. The girl helps him escape and goes to Sam, a shady plantation owner, to try to get them out of Singapore. However, Sam has his own plans for Poppy, and they don't include potential rivals for her affections.","popularity":0.1974,"poster_path":"/otLoAsQPpZGFcqcqf49YzMOqo4W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A million dollar ship blown to bits- A thousand panic stricken passengers rushing to safety- A wild leopard set loose on a threatening mob- Action-thrills-excitement- in the kind of a show you love to see!","title":"The Half-Way Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Escrava Branca","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Den hvide Slavinde","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Halbweltmadchen","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Idän väijyvät vaarat","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"To karavi tou thanatou","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"In den greep van het noodlot","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Almas Errantes","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Halfway Girl","type":"Alternate Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Halfway Girl","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","title":"Kći kokete","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Kenyon","original_name":"Doris Kenyon","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/laM51FLnMQbtaSiAZYyUpd4ZRB7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Poppy","credit_id":"67acd6c63e4967e13e36d10a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Hughes","original_name":"Lloyd Hughes","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/ejZIGbXs0wObn0e9g7BlDF1JTTz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Phil Douglas","credit_id":"67acd6fea58cead38d9f37ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Guthrie","credit_id":"67acd73a3ee708327c36dc9d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tully Marshall","original_name":"Tully Marshall","popularity":0.2691,"profile_path":"/4bBj7eZ2A8LjO1HZnHipjPhLu5Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Crab","credit_id":"67acd75353353f9bba36d1e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Hardy","original_name":"Sam Hardy","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/u0hirR29HoOSr8duXR3ntNjrtP0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jardine","credit_id":"67acd7711168deda109f2faa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Wellesley","original_name":"Charles Wellesley","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gibson","credit_id":"67acd77e1168deda109f2fc9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha O'Dwyer","original_name":"Martha O'Dwyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Brown","credit_id":"67acd78c645669137e9f34a2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Crute","original_name":"Sally Crute","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j4EAUflh93T6hlZV0eSvTS2XFtx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Effie","credit_id":"67acd7973ee708327c36dcfc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2125761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry West","original_name":"Henry West","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Captain of the Mandalay","credit_id":"67acd7c141483dd5ccd0a5b3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Flander","original_name":"Roland Flander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67acd7c83ee708327c36dd18","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Francis Dillon","original_name":"John Francis Dillon","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/8WWebUUEfcpcTvUNhFAeeoPRQbR.jpg","credit_id":"67acd7de3ee708327c36dd2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph F.
