When Randolph meets Cecil's sister Penelope, a romance begins which is furthered after one of the Bazelhurst servants shoots Randolph in the arm for trespassing and Penelope, who earlier had looked upon the feud as a joke, runs away to Randolph's house and accepts his engagement proposal. Cecil and his men pursue Penelope, but are frightened away by Randolph's men and are forced to spend a miserable stormy night in the woods. The next day everyone becomes reconciled when Lady Evelyn realizes that the desired property will now be in the family, and Randolph offers Cecil and his men dry, if ill-fitting, garments to wear.","popularity":0.4972,"poster_path":"/pNyjDqiLlAcKPxNlEuigBkQScdw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excel Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The thrilling story of a young girl who is driven into happiness by a cruel sister-in-law, in which PEGGY HYLAND appears as the heroine.","title":"Cowardice Court","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"臆病者の家","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1905717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Hyland","original_name":"Peggy Hyland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lUCpoMIgjvKRlOrPXyTKdmNC1cN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Honorable Penelope Drake","credit_id":"67acf4937241eef4869f35e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Livingston","original_name":"Jack Livingston","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/y7Gs83nnlnPo7kvf6R16nYsMcmM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Randolph Shaw","credit_id":"67acf49e8c5579ba6e36d151","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Hoyt","original_name":"Arthur Hoyt","popularity":0.1924,"profile_path":"/pVUoMq4jT8AgBgKbUrHH7lOLoGy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lord Cecil Bazelhurst","credit_id":"67acf4ab7241eef4869f35f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Adams","original_name":"Kathryn Adams","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/2JwAAfwP6BTuHinuESSY2BeZQQB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lady Evelyn Bazelhurst","credit_id":"67acf4c441483dd5ccd0abb0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burton Law","original_name":"Burton Law","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tompkins","credit_id":"67acf4d4645669137e9f384c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bull Montana","original_name":"Bull Montana","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":"/oHLGtY2ijPQqZwS9Td0jHaBL9y8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Flash Morton","credit_id":"67acf4ddd0fd64d9f2d0ab3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Lonsdale","original_name":"Harry Lonsdale","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":"/xEq7ssiVJJAfsQk8gMgDclt79Cp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Duke","credit_id":"67acf4e97241eef4869f360a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Grassby","original_name":"Bertram Grassby","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/fmam6pfammNnEBWsYxCKnYdRv3P.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Count","credit_id":"67acf4f37241eef4869f3613","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gung Wong","original_name":"Gung Wong","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Yank Foo","credit_id":"67acf510645669137e9f386b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al McKinnon","original_name":"Al McKinnon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Groom","credit_id":"67acf51e7241eef4869f3626","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Mulhall","original_name":"Evelyn Mulhall","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"A Guest","credit_id":"67acf529d0fd64d9f2d0ab6e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Hill","original_name":"Bonnie Hill","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/m5bBQxEdv3YaUQ7bnxE4M6hmIXB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"A Guest","credit_id":"67acf532d63e9deeea36d2fe","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dunbar","original_name":"Robert Dunbar","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"A Guest","credit_id":"67acf56cd63e9deeea36d30c","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Steers","original_name":"Larry Steers","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/8QBHXihnGldVMNIxnbW2ljTk7Y1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"A Guest","credit_id":"67acf5777241eef4869f3655","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"King D.
