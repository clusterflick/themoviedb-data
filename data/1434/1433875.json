The basic premise of \"Swabbies\" was a retread of \"Stripes,\" the classic Bill Murray/Harold Ramis comedy. The story found our heroes, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy out of work, out of luck and in need of a job. They end up enlisting in the Navy and going to boot camp with Pete as their exasperated drill instructor and then meet their feminine counterparts, Minnie Mouse, Daisy Duck, and Clarabelle Cow. Once they put to sea, they encounter a submarine full of the Beagle Boys.","popularity":0.8255,"poster_path":"/rvPclpqtdSiZaDXZxkhCzWoncAk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swabbies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Allwine","original_name":"Wayne Allwine","popularity":0.3558,"profile_path":"/flzMLsxCbDabCoDM1LWjxVfUSWK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mickey Mouse","credit_id":"67ae63aaf28d95adb3d0d8fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Anselmo","original_name":"Tony Anselmo","popularity":0.4421,"profile_path":"/8ocCq9OxVg7A0g7hf7EqeT0QenX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donald Duck","credit_id":"67ae63bfd63e9deeea3704a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Farmer","original_name":"Bill Farmer","popularity":0.8522,"profile_path":"/lhezx68R12s5Bsv7d77BrQb7tWA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Goofy","credit_id":"67ae63ddf28d95adb3d0d92b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Ryan","original_name":"Will Ryan","popularity":0.3108,"profile_path":"/qRkyGcSju2VmEb7RTBM3Wpa0rvI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pete / Beagle Boys","credit_id":"67ae63ef41483dd5ccd0d57a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darrell Van Citters","original_name":"Darrell Van Citters","popularity":0.2824,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ae6407d63e9deeea3704c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tad Stones","original_name":"Tad Stones","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/mMIS8tPnAmNXoyDzFw3p6P7gpbE.jpg","credit_id":"67ae641541483dd5ccd0d58b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ed Gombert","original_name":"Ed Gombert","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/aSPFeR2Ck9yD4wQAr0YgYe3Vfv9.jpg","credit_id":"67ae6422f28d95adb3d0d961","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Ranft","original_name":"Joe Ranft","popularity":0.5796,"profile_path":"/f1BoWC2JbCcfP1e5hKfGsxkHzVU.jpg","credit_id":"67ae642d1168deda109f79f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490953,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Michael Giaimo","original_name":"Michael Giaimo","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/evcSdDxOVCXEJfU2BQ740zMa7TT.jpg","credit_id":"67ae643ad63e9deeea370514","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rvPclpqtdSiZaDXZxkhCzWoncAk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
